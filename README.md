# DBADrafter-2.0
This is the drafter program for Umbra Sellsword in DBA.

Just run the DBADrafter.py file and it should work. It will output a file called DraftedKit#.txt which will act as a saved record of what you got.

I think there might be a really REALLY rare crash relating to the program getting random items but I haven't been able to reproduce it while testing it so shrug.
