weapon,Axel,Star Impact,,0,A basic jab directly at the enemy! Deals 7 damage at 1 range.
weapon,Axel,Shooting Star,,0,"Axel makes a finger gun with his hands, and from it fires a star-shaped projectile made of his epithet’s energy. Deals 3 damage at 5 range."
talent,Axel,Wheat Town Beatdown,,2,"Whenever Axel successfully lands a hit, he can immediately perform another action, so long as it isn’t an action he’s taken previously this turn. The damage of this following action is halved rounded up, and if that chains into another attack it gets halved again into 1/4th its damage rounded up, and so on. Critical hits bypass this damage proration and just deal double their base. ✪✪✪ moves go up one level of proration and ✪✪✪✪✪ go up two, but even if they successfully land you cannot chain them into another hit."
talent,Axel,Bog-Standard Palette,,0,"Axel is immune to effects revolving around things “so awful they have actual effects” due to his awful tastes in everything. For example, attacks that use “bad music” to deal damage don’t affect him because he weirdly likes them. Same with food, movies, and pretty much anything you can think of. Can selectively not work based on RP reasons."
talent,Axel,Perfect Contact,,0,"Axel can telepathically communicate with anyone he knows, regardless of distance or plane. This communication is two-way, but must be initiated by Axel."
talent,Axel,Perfect Direction,,0,"Axel always knows the direction of true and magnetic north and if those things are fucky at the moment, and can naturally navigate to locations he’s been to before unless something is interrupting his ability to track."
talent,Axel,Wanderlust Form,,0,"By spending ✪✪✪✪✪ as a free action, Axel can enter a special form for the next two rounds where his hair turns blue and his energy becomes much much stronger, mixing the red white and blue colors into a purple. His rolls get the d12 advantage his passive can grant, he gets a passive +1 damage to all his attacks, and his ✪✪✪ and ✪✪✪✪✪ supers now ignore combo proration entirely."
talent,Axel,Ace In The Hole,,1,"Once Axel is at or below 1/4th of his max stamina rounded down, he no longer has to pay stamina for abilities until he goes back above that, and he immediately gains ✪✪✪ the first time this happens in a combat."
talent,Axel,Perfect Transport,,1,"As a movement action, Axel is able to teleport to a space adjacent to anyone he knows, regardless of distance or plane. However, this ability is also fairly easy to inhibit and tends to get muddled by planar whims or stress, occasionally disabling travel outside of the immediate vicinity. Axel cannot take anything other than what he normally carries with him."
passive,Axel,Spangled Stars,,1,"Whenever Axel lands a successful damaging hit on someone, he gets a ✪ star! He can only have a max of 5 ✪s at a time. He can spend one ✪ as a once per round anytime to give someone a sort of advantage, where they roll a 1d12 that is still judged on the d20 scale (that does not crit on 12) as their second advantage roll. He can also spend ✪s when using abilities to boost their power! [16 Prof] Fight Anticipation - Axel gets +✪ at the start of combat. [45 Prof] Star Point Anchor - Axel now keeps his ✪s between combats. [50 Prof] Granting 1d12 advantage no longer requires a roll to grant. Spending the ✪ makes it automatically trigger."
passive,Axel,Share The Love,,0,"Axel’s epithet gathers energy from people’s love. Via this technique a funny doctor (:O) helped him develop, Axel can send some of that energy back! As an unrolled main action that can’t combo, Axel can divvy up any of the ✪s he has to allies within 3 spaces, who can use them with actions to boost their level! Usually ✪ boosts a skill to an “EX” version, dealing slightly more damage and gaining some nice extra effect. ✪✪✪ and ✪✪✪✪✪ are escalating levels of super powered modifications with ✪✪✪✪✪ being basically Once Per Combat level."
ability,Axel,London Knuckle,1,0,"Axel does a dash forwards as energy comes off his fist. This deals 5 (7) damage as he dashes up to 6 spaces away. This can hit multiple targets, but the damage is reduced greatly after the first. The hit can either be an energy slice in which Axel passes through his targets, or it can be a punch that sends the targets flying back. Axel can combo even if the knockback hit is chosen by attacking them before they’d be launched back. ✪ - +3 damage. This rolls with the 1d12 advantage your passive grants. ✪✪✪ - This causes you to use London Knuckle up to three times. You have to roll for each usage but only pay stamina for one. Each hit prorates in your combo separately. This also only generates one ✪ even if multiple of the London Knuckles hit. ✪✪✪✪✪ - +5 damage. +6 range. +1 crit range. This hit only works on a single target as Axel punches a star-shaped weak point on the target, causing them to fly up to 10 spaces back. [14 Prof] Your basic attack and London Knuckle get +1 damage. [41 Prof] Your basic attack and London Knuckle get +1 damage."
ability,Axel,Venice Spire,3,1,"Axel channels energy into his fists before punching the ground. On any space within 5 range of Axel, a giant spike of energy comes up from the floor and skewers a target for 5 (7) damage and knocking them in the air! On higher rolls this can cause a bleed proc. ✪ - +2 damage. The spike gets a secondary effect of your choice! ✪✪✪ - +2 damage. Instead of one targeted spike, Axel causes a line of three spikes to shoot out from in front of him. Axel can choose to have there be between 0 and 2 spaces between each spike along the line, and the line can be diagonal. The spikes get a secondary effect of your choice! ✪✪✪✪✪ - +2 damage. Instead of one targeted spike, Axel creates three rings of spikes around him to shoot out on all sides of him. Axel can choose to have there be between 0 and 2 spaces between each ring of spikes. The spikes either get a secondary effect of your choice, or you can trade out the effect and the bleed for knockback which can chain from one spike to the next! [32 Prof] Choose one: Venice Spire gets +2 damage."
ability,Axel,Tokyo Flare,1,0,"Axel charges star-shaped energy into his palm before tossing it to the floor. It travels along the ground like a shockwave, dealing 4 (5) damage to a target within 8 range. ✪ - +1 damage. The projectile gets a special property of your choice! ✪✪✪ - +1 damage. The projectile knocks the enemy into the air, stunning them long enough for Axel to immediately take a move action and continue the combo. ✪✪✪✪✪ - +2 damage. The projectile explodes on the target it hits, dealing an additional 3 damage to both the hit target and everyone adjacent to the blast. [23 Prof] Choose one: Tokyo Flare gets either +2 range or +1 damage."
ability,Axel,California Eagle,2,0,"Axel proceeds to kick in the air multiple times! This move causes Axel to move forwards in the air 3 spaces, dealing 2 damage and knocking back the target in front of him for each movement he takes, with the final hit slamming them into the floor. This attack rolls with d12 advantage if the target being attacked is in the air. ✪ - Moves 4 spaces instead of 3. Grants d12 advantage on your next action this turn if the target is in the air. ✪✪✪ - Moves 5 spaces instead of 3. The final hit kicks the target up to 5 spaces away in a direction of your choice. ✪✪✪✪✪ - Moves 7 spaces instead of 3. The final hit slams the target into the ground so hard that their next movement action is halved"
ability,Axel,Paris Parry,0,0,"Axel moves his body to deflect a melee attack slightly to reduce its damage, and proceeds to go in with an energy-infused jab for half his basic attack damage back. He’ll step a few spaces forwards to get in range if necessary. This cannot combo. Once per round. ✪ - Axel moves his body to block a melee attack regardless of the weight or force, negating the incoming damage. ✪✪✪ - Axel moves his body to block a melee attack regardless of the weight or force, negating the incoming damage. His counterattack does his full basic attack damage. ✪✪✪✪✪ - Axel moves his body to block a melee attack regardless of the weight or force, negating the incoming damage. His counterattack does his full basic attack damage. You can combo off this hit."
ability,Axel,Giza Drop,3!,0,"Axel jumps at extreme speeds to a target within his movement speed of range that is currently airborne, grabbing them before bursting straight up into the air. He then does a spinning drop attack from high in the air to slam them down on that space to deal 5 damage. This move does not combo and prorates if done during a combo, but does not take up a combo’s action since it’s an anytime. Once per round. ✪ - +1 damage. Once they’ve launched into the air, Axel can have the target and him land on any space within his movement speed of range. ✪✪✪ - +2 damage. This version can also combo but only if it is Axel’s turn. ✪✪✪✪✪ - +2 damage. You can combo off this hit."
weapon,Echo,Enkidu,,2,"One dagger in a set of two, this dark grey blade patterned like sakura wood is of the highest craftsmanship. It deals 8 damage at 1 range which pierces mundane DR, can be used in the middle of movement, and can be used as a main or movement action. You may only attack with this weapon once per round. Each time you attack with this weapon and don’t critically succeed, its crit range increases by +1 until it next crits. You may also use this weapon not to attack, but to instead use the Taunt weapon action, which increases your critical hit range by +1 for all attacks until you next crit this combat (taunts automatically succeed). As a passive while holding both Enkidu and Gilgamesh, if you have at least four allies, all your allies are unconscious, and you are at 10 or less stamina, then any of your actions that succeed are considered critical successes. This state does not end if you heal above the stamina threshold, but does end if any of your allies are resuscitated. Even if you’re an epithet user, you gain proficiency from using Enkidu as if you were a mundie. As a guaranteed success bonus action, Echo can transport the pattern of an ally’s epithet into Enkidu. Only one epithet can be held like this at a time, and it can be held between sessions. You can transform into that person as if they were currently in your party. At the start of a session, you may roll three random words and choose one. That becomes Enkidu’s current Attunement. As an X cost ability, you can generally utilize your Attunement to create effects related to it. If your Attunement is the same epithet as the epithet of someone you’ve transformed into before, then you can transform into them as if they were present in the party. If your Attunement is the same epithet as the epithet of the person you’re attacking, Enkidu deals 1.5x damage rounding up to them and has resistance to that epithet’s attempt to weaken or stop Enkidu or its attacks. Enkidu has five Glass Fragments, which act as special charges. She can expend these charges passively and without a roll to increase a single instance of a numeric epithetical effect by +1. This can be done to an action, even after the action is rolled. When altering things, the effect will last at most a round before returning to its original state. You can do this to anything that originates from you or something adjacent to you. These Glass Fragments recharge at the end of the session."
weapon,Echo,Gilgamesh,,2,"One dagger in a set of two, this dark red blade patterned with spider webbing is of the highest craftsmanship. It deals 8 damage at 1 range which pierces mundane DR, can be used in the middle of movement, and can be used as a main or movement action. You may only attack with this weapon once per round. Each time you attack with this weapon and don’t critically succeed, its crit range increases by +1 until it next crits. You may also use this weapon not to attack, but to instead use the Taunt weapon action, which increases your critical hit range by +1 for all attacks until you next crit this combat (taunts automatically succeed). As a passive while holding both Enkidu and Gilgamesh, if you have at least four allies, all your allies are unconscious, and you are at 10 or less stamina, then any of your actions that succeed are considered critical successes. This state does not end if you heal above the stamina threshold, but does end if any of your allies are resuscitated. The wielder of Gilgamesh has access to a special 1 cost ability that acts as a sword wave slash, which deals 3 damage up to 8 range away and pierces through enemies to potentially deal damage to multiple people. Gilgamesh comes with a set of programmable modes. Whenever someone wields Gilgamesh, the blade automatically records the person’s various aspects to work best for them, granting them extra features and modifying the weapon to be their best fit. These modes are called Profiles, and you may swap which one is active any time once per round. Uniquely, because of how Echo’s powers work the blade also records Profiles for whoever she is turned into as well. (This applies retroactively to her previous transformations as well, since on her own time she can turn into them.) (Link to doc with all Profiles) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsbON2S7zmYA47Ae0ir3OPyT_nc-UOXhSdsfyBl77GM/edit"
talent,Echo,Lightweight Variant,,0,"Echo gets +1 movement regardless of who she’s taking the form of. [74 Prof] Echo gets +1 movement regardless of who she’s taking the form of. In addition, whenever she moves she can dissipate into shadow and appear in the appropriate location, effectively acting as a teleport (though this can’t move her through solid walls)."
talent,Echo,Best Friend Bash,,0,"Whenever you perform an action, you may create a shadow copy that moves up to half your movement speed rounded up and then performs that action, instead of you doing it yourself. This doesn’t require any extra rolls and keeps the real Echo away from most forms of retaliation. Whenever a Best Friend Bash is released, at the end of their action if they were successfully performed you can choose to teleport to the position they were at. [42 Prof] Whenever a Terror Twin is released, at the end of their action if they were successfully performed you can choose to teleport to the position they were at. [56 Prof] Best Friend Bash no longer costs extra stamina to use."
talent,Echo,Rise of The Reskins,,0,"Rise of The Reskins - When in the presence of Echo, other Copycat characters get stronger! Any copying or copied things in their kit(s) cost 1 less stamina to use (to a minimum of 1) and roll with a +1 modifier."
talent,Echo,Getting The Download,,0,"Once a move has been successfully performed against Echo, she slightly learns how to counter it. This lets her spend 1 stamina and perform a counter roll against that move whenever it’s used on her again this combat."
passive,Echo,Dark Copy,,0,Echo can add some kind of shadow element to anything she does.
passive,Echo,Double Trouble,,1,Echo now has two move actions on her turns.
passive,Baku Baku No Mi,Blizzard Body,,1,"You are able to completely turn into snow. This grants you immunity to cold damage to a certain temperature extent. In addition, your snow naturally parts when threatened with extreme damage. This means you have an effective 5 DR that only triggers when taking more than 10 damage, in such a way that if you say took 12 damage, 2 of your DR would activate and you would take 10 instead"
passive,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Snow Grace,,0,"With the ability to dissolve into snow, you can move through non-complete barriers such as enemies and objects, as well as travel through the air (though you cannot stay flying once you rematerialize). In addition, you can freely dissolve and move through snow, and in snow storms you appear invisible unless 2 spaces away."
ability,Echo,Terror Twin,1!,2,"Echo creates a shadowy duplicate of their current form at their current location, performing a specified action or anytime. This target is ethereal and cannot normally be interacted with. As a move action, Echo can “release” the copy to have them fly out anywhere within their movement speed and perform the specified action. Whether or not the action succeeds or fails, the copy disappears afterwards. Each Terror Twin has a 1 stamina upkeep. Once per round. [18 Prof] Terrible Twos - As long as you only have one Terror Twin out at a time, you no longer have to pay its upkeep cost. [22 Prof] Who’s The Real One? - As a move action Echo can switch teleport with a Terror Twin. [42 Prof] Whenever a Terror Twin is released, at the end of their action if they were successfully performed you can choose to teleport to the position they were at. [44 Prof] Terror Twins no longer have an upkeep cost associated with them. [46 Prof] Fast Fakers - Terror Twins can now be used with anytimes, allowing them to be stored for later. They still require a movement action to be activated."
ability,Echo,Fake Around Here,1!,2,"An attack that would hit Echo instead passes straight through a shadow. Echo can then choose to spend an additional stamina to take a movement action and get out of dodge! Once per round. [54 Prof] After successfully using Fake Around Here, you can choose to pay an additional stamina and roll to immediately create a Terror Twin in the spot that was attacked."
ability,Echo,Five Man Band,3⛯,2,"Once per combat Echo can make their form suddenly unstable, allowing them to perform one action as each of their party members individually by creating multiple shadowy clones. Echo still has to pay stamina for any of these actions if applicable on top of this ability’s cost, and has to roll for each of them on top of rolling for this. [12 Prof] If there are less than five other party members in your team, Echo’s Five Man Band can use multiple actions from the party members you *do* have to total to five. [28 Prof] We’re Gonna Get You~ - When using Five Man Band, you can hold each of their actions as Terror Twins. However, they are released as free actions instead of move actions. You still roll for each."
ability,Echo,Seeing Double,X!,2,"A shadowy copy of something, whether it be an item, action, event, person, or even a place, forks out from the original. If a duplicated thing stays out in the field, then this ability can’t be used again until that thing is dispelled as a free action. If Echo is knocked out, they’re automatically dispelled. Cost is dependent on the power and complexity of what is being replicated. Once per round."
ability,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Igloo Defense,X,0,"By extending your hands, you can create up to X spaces of snow. Each space has around 10 effective stamina of its own and has your cold damage immunity, but is vulnerable to heat damage. You can freely pass through these yourself."
ability,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Snow Warning,1,0,"The area begins to snow supernaturally, even while inside. This decreases the temperature of the area to below freezing and covers the arena in a thin layer of snow. Any fire damage made within the snowstorm is halved rounding up, while cold damage is increased by 1.5x, rounding down. Upkeep 1."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Yugure,,0,"Elanora’s oldest weapon, a katana that has seen every battlefield. Deals 5 damage at 1 range."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Earthshaker,,0,"A large, rusted metal sword. This deals 7 damage at 2 range."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Parrying Dagger,,0,"A small knife, effective for dueling and easy to acquire. Deals 3 damage at 1 range. Can be used as a partial main action at full effectiveness."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Stonework,,0,"An even larger version of the Earthshaker, made of stone. This deals 9 damage at 3 range."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Cognizant Scythe,,0,A scythe made of psychic energy. Deals 5 damage at 2 range.
talent,Dusk Elanora,Weapon Stance,,1,"Elanora is able to immediately hold a weapon and understand its unique stylings, and take that for herself. She can instantly use any weapon properly and can wield two-handed weapons with one hand. She can have exactly one weapon “drawn” at a time. Only drawn weapons can be used, and it takes a bonus action to switch drawn weapons. You can draw a weapon for free at the start of combat. While a weapon is drawn, it effectively acts as a stance, giving you extra passive benefits and granting/modifying abilities. Natural 20s with weapons grant you proficiency as if using your epithet. Finally, once per session you may permanently keep a weapon you find/steal for yourself, writing a new stance for it."
passive,Dusk Elanora,Thief of Destiny,,1,"Elanora’s epithet drains her of her own colors. As such, she has almost no action economy of her own: she cannot take main, move, bonus, or anytime actions normally. However, she can subvert this by stealing the action economy of others. She can freely take actions from allies that are willing to give it to her, but when it comes to the unwilling she needs to actually take from them. Whenever you land an attack on an enemy, you can steal your choice of a Partial Main Action, Partial Move Action, a bonus action, or an anytime usage from them. Partial Main Actions are functionally half of a main action: Elanora may freely combine two partial main actions into one, or split main actions into two partials. A partial main action can be used to do anything that a normal main action can do, but at halved effectiveness rounding up. When you steal a Partial Main Action from someone, it takes half the next main action turning it into a Partial Main action. A Partial Move Action is effectively the same thing: it’s a move action where you travel half your movement (rounding up), and you can freely merge/split them yourself. When stealing any kind of action, it effectively removes that person’s action of that type from being usable the next time they’d be able to. If a person does not have a type of action normally, you can only take a max of one of those actions from them in a combat, and you can’t have allies lend you actions they do not have either. Lastly: while you still gain the partial main actions, you cannot steal the last Partial Main Action someone has their next turn. Elanora can keep actions she steals for as long as she desires in a combat, although she can’t bring it between combats. The only action economy of her own is a single partial movement action, which cannot be stored like the actions she steals."
ability,Dusk Elanora,Thief of Notions,3,0,Elanora grabs an enemy and takes as much of their destiny as she can. This ability effectively acts as four steal triggers from your passive (Thief of Destiny) at once. Its speed means that enemies roll disadvantage on anytimes trying to stop this.
ability,Dusk Elanora,Color Chain,2!,2,"An epithetical chain of colors manifests from Elanora’s missing arm, acting as a 6 range tether. Not once per round."
ability,Dusk Elanora,Hurricane Spin,2,0,"Elanora spins around attacking all around her. This deals 2 damage to all adjacent enemy spaces to her. She then takes a step forward and spins again, and does this for a total of 2 spaces moved and 3 attacks."
weapon,Ramos,Punch/Kick,,0,"Ramos hits a man just kinda generally, dealing 7 damage at 1 range. Can potentially trade damage for other stuff I guess. [45 Prof] Skill And Power Combined - Ramos gains +1 basic attack damage and can move-act-move. "
talent,Ramos,I'm Kinda Born Perfect,,2,"Ramos has the benefits of being a powerhouse and expert mundie at the same time, and is of the “excel” build type."
talent,Ramos,Don't Sweat The Details,,0,"You’re just absolutely horrible with money. Any cash that ends up in your hands is spent, stolen, or lost within half an hour."
talent,Ramos,Eyes of The Sage,,0,Ramos’ epithet augments his sight such that he naturally notices finer details about techniques that others might not. This also gives him a +5 on perception checks.
passive,Ramos,God-Given Talent,,2,"Ramos is so naturally talented as to instantly create incredible techniques with just the slightest bit of thought and experimentation. He has access to a special resource known as Talent, and can spend it at any time to develop new techniques. Your Talent is equal to your Proficiency. When creating a new technique, Ramos must roll for each feature of the technique being made. However, he can replace his roll with the highest roll he’s performed himself either creating or using that Inspiration for the technique in this combat. Ramos’ big limiting factor is that he can’t really “think outside the box”, so he needs to see something before he starts thinking about how he can utilize it himself. This gives him Inspiration for that technique which lasts forever (so long as he remembers it). He can’t gain Inspiration for something unless he can think of some method (even if it’s some very bullshit anime logic) of doing it himself. New techniques last for as long as you have Talent “allocated” to it, and can un-allocate at the start of your turns. So long as one roll to create the technique was a 20, or Ramos rolls a 20 using/in relation to that technique, it becomes put on his sheet. He still needs to put the same amount of Talent into it to unlock it, however: whenever Ramos gains Proficiency, he can instead permanently lower the Talent cost of that technique by 1.5x rounding up. Techniques that use abilities beyond what a normal person should be capable of will have a minimum Talent cost that can’t be reduced equal to the number of impossible elements. Lastly, you can allocate Talent for these universal features. You don’t need to roll when you do these: 1 Talent -> +1 movement. 2 Talent -> +1 in a non-combat general skill (ex. Strength, stealth, lockpicking) 5 Talent -> -1 stamina costs paid (minimum cost of 0) 10 Talent -> +1 per round 1 cost dodgeroll anytime. 10 Talent -> Natural +1 on all rolls (max of +3) 50 Talent -> An additional action [43 Prof] Mastered Technique - Once Ramos has reduced a technique’s talent requirement to its minimum, he can now use that technique in place of ALL of its inspirations when developing new skills. [53 Prof] Focused Insight - Whenever Ramos critically succeeds on a technique he’s created, and he can still spend Proficiency on that technique to lower its permanent Talent cost, he can spend the Proficiency gained from that crit into the Talent at a 1:3.5 ratio instead of 1:1.5."
passive,Ramos,"Excellence Is Not An Art, It's A Habit",,2,"Ramos has a special resource known as “Excel”. He can have up to 5 at a time. Ramos starts combat with max stacks of Excel (because his default state is awesome). He gains one at the start of his turns passively, and can spend 10 Talent to regenerate one instantly. Excel can be spent when performing actions to dramatically alter them for the better. This can be done after a roll, even to get around anytimes. It always succeeds but may require a roll to determine effectiveness. Lastly: Ramos can also spend Excel to redo a roll for making a technique."
passive,Ramos,Psychic Body Stance: Remote Siege,,1,"By paying additional stamina before performing any martial arts techniques, Ramos can cause the attack (with +1 damage) to originate from psychic limbs appearing around the target before disappearing. This increases their range by 3 per stamina cost paid and lets him attack a target so long as he can sense their location. The limbs appear around the target and are invisible unless you’re a psychic yourself, meaning these actions gain slightly weaker benefits of invisibility (can’t react outside of highly instinct based features, invisible roll bonus)."
passive,Ramos,Unholy Constitution,,2,"Ramos can fill his body with unholy demonic energies granting him a form of sacrilegious immortality. This grants Ramos Fast Healing 6, and two of this fast healing can be active while unconscious unless Ramos is in contact with something of holy energy (silver, holy water, etc). Ramos cannot receive healing outside of this passive while it is active."
ability,Ramos,The Impasse of My Perfection,?2,1,"This action can be “held” in secret, either using your main or movement action. Upon an attack being used against you, so long as you have the proper inspiration for that technique, you can immediately spend this held attack to zoom up to your movement speed to them, dodging the incoming hit and perform that exact attack against them. If held as a main action, the attack’s effectiveness is increased by 1.5x rounding up. Cost is equal to the replicated technique + 2."
ability,Ramos,One-Inch Punch,3,1,"Despite only moving your fist slightly, Ramos delivers a massive amount of force in one attack. This deals 10 damage piercing through Physical DR and 10 knockback at 1 range. If a target hits a wall, any extra knockback is converted into damage. They also deal 5 damage to any enemies whom they fly through while being hit back. Recharge 6."
ability,Ramos,High Fly Razor,3,0,"Ramos jumps towards a target within his movement speed as range, grabs them, twists them in the air, and piledrives them into the ground. This can work on targets regardless of size, deals 6 damage +1 per size category above 1x1 of the target, and knocks them to the ground prone."
ability,Ramos,It's Within My Capabilities,5!,0,"Ramos instantly moves up to an action to get a close up detailed observation of it. This should give him actions, but instead he is able to gain a stored roll equal to the roll of the action observed with a natural +1. He can only use this stored die on himself and only on either using a technique that would share an inspiration with the observed technique, or when developing that technique himself. These stored dice last basically forever until you use them. Once per round."
ability,Ramos,Epiphany,0,0,Free action. Once per session. A visible aura of power starts emanating from the epithet user. For the next 3 rounds this character reduces the cost of their abilities by 1 stamina (to a minimum of 1). Stamina upkeep for abilities is also reduced and may be reduced to 0.
ability,Ramos,Wind Step Palm,1,0,"Ramos uses his basic attack, but using a flowing stance. This allows him to move up to 3 spaces before the attack occurs, and the attack gains additional knockback equal to its damage. The knockback can send them in any direction, not just straight back. If they’re knocked into a wall, any excess knockback is converted into damage."
ability,Ramos,Psychic Blast Technique: Emerald Eye,3,1,"Ramos uses his psychic energy to create a 1x1 orb of psychic energy next to him. This “eye” can be moved by Ramos up to 6 spaces on his turn or as a 1 cost twice per round anytime. It deals 6 contact damage to enemies once per turn per person and pushes/knocks around enemies. Ramos can see through the eye and gets a +1 on perception checks while it’s out. This technique is easily modifiable with external psychic energy: Ramos can take a bonus action to attempt to modify the psychic energy of the orb using one of his inspirations by altering his psychic energy for the round. If he crits on this, or the orb crits while it has it, Ramos can create a new version of this technique that incorporates that new aspect as if critting on a new technique. Lastly, Ramos can as an anytime detonate the orb, exploding to deal 11 damage to all enemies adjacent to them and inflicting Knock Up. Each ability instance of this can only have one eye active at a time. Once per combat."
ability,Ramos,Sword Smithing Technique: Blade Of Infinite Recursion,1,0,"Ramos takes a nearby piece of material and instantaneously creates a supreme quality weapon out of it, infused with your psychic power. This creates a 1-3 range 7-13 damage blade out of the material, with stats dependent on the roll to make it and the materials it's made out of. The blade can cleave or pierce to hit multiple targets at once. It also has the special property of recycling kinetic energy. Whenever the blade lands an attack or is used to block an attack, it stores a charge of power. You may release this power before making a roll to increase the roll, damage, or knockback of the attack. These swords can continue to exist without Ramos’ intervention, but lose their psychic property when separated from him."
ability,Ramos,Demon Aura Technique: God Sight,5,0,"Ramos unleashes a massive amount of ki, imbued with a dark and sinister power. This creates a 10 range aura of intense spiritual pressure that instantly applies a fear affect for the round on anyone within while inside, and applies a continuous fear effect if they can sense spiritual pressure. Ramos’ aura allows him to be completely aware of whatever happens in the area, letting him observe things that are invisible and react almost instantaneously. This also means that effects that make anytimes harder via speed or stealth are entirely ineffective on him. Lastly, it also causes “It’s Within My Capabilities” to roll with advantage. Upkeep 1. Bonus action. Once per combat. (fear is double movement cost to move towards you and disadvantage to attack you)"
ability,Ramos,Mountain Striking Fist,2,0,"Ramos focuses all of his strength into a single blow, using a martial arts basic attack with a +3 to damage and knocking the hit target prone on rolls 16+. While doing this attack Ramos utterly refuses to move, having a super armor-esque effect where his attack cannot be interrupted and is immune to knockback. At best, the enemy can attempt to dodge."
ability,Ramos,Psychic Armor Technique: Impenetrable Tempest,0⛯,2,"Upon activation, Ramos diverts a massive amount of psychic energy into creating multiple layers of armor made out of raw willpower around himself in all directions. Ramos may at any point spend any amount of stamina and increase his Armor Class value by twice that much. This always succeeds, but requires a roll to be done in reaction to an attack to see if it activates in time. This Armor Class value cannot exceed 19 and resets back to 0 at the start of your turns, but is always at a minimum of 5 even without costs. The stamina cost from this can only be reduced by at max 8 a round. Whenever your psychic armor stops an attack, if the target is within 3 range of you they’re blasted for 1d4! lightning damage and sent flying backwards 8 spaces (If they’re knocked into a wall, any excess knockback is converted into damage). While the armor is active you are also immune to mind reading and mind control, you remove terrain effects you pass through by re-shaping them back to normal, and you can remove up to 2 stacks of any status effect on you for free at the start of your turns. Once per combat."
ability,Ramos,One-Handed Technique: Punching Sword,1,0,"Ramos flash steps up to their movement in a straight line, swinging a sword along the way. This deals 5 damage to everyone you pass through, however before the damage is dealt you get to make a basic attack roll (with a +2) with Punch/Kick for each enemy you pass through. If they do not stop the basic attack, that person cannot anytime or react to the sword strike."
ability,Ramos,Power Nap,0⛯,1,"Guaranteed success. Ramos goes the fuck to sleep. This immediately gives him basically end-of-combat healing, status clearing, opc refilling, etc. However, he also goes unconscious for the next 1d3+1 rounds. Once per combat."
ability,Ramos,Spirit Gun,X,0,"Ramos forms his hand into a finger gun and “fires” out a wave of spiritual energy. This deals energy damage in a 1x60 line from you, and the cost determines how powerful the attack is. 1 stamina = 3-5 damage 2 stamina = 5-7 damage 3 stamina = 8-10 damage 4 stamina = 10-12 damage 5 stamina = 12 damage, also increases size to 3x50. Each point past 5 just adds 1 damage."
weapon,Regent Grey,All I Want Is Endless,,2,"White and black flames manifest in any configuration you can imagine, obliterating a target for 12 damage at 10 range. This damage is typeless."
passive,Regent Grey,Bow Thy Head And Close Thy Peasant Mind,,2,"Regent Grey has advantage on all of their rolls, which can stack with other forms of advantage. In addition, whenever an attack would be made against them or they’d be targeted with an effect, Regent Grey can perform an action to try and counter it. Should they roll higher than the incoming effect and their action is appropriate for it, they counter what would affect them completely!"
ability,Regent Grey,B Tatsu,5,2,"Despite her apparition-like appearance and frail form, this bitch can throw down like you wouldn’t believe. Regent Grey kicks or punches a target for 9 damage. The first time this succeeds, you may immediately follow up with another hit that requires its own roll. You can keep doing this for a total of 3 attacks."
ability,Regent Grey,Dishonest Confession,7,2,"A massive scythe appears from behind Regent Grey, which they twirl and control as if it were an extension of themself. She can throw it up to 8 spaces, as it slashes everything it passes through for 11 damage. The scythe will stay in the location you threw it to, continuing to float there and dealing 1 damage at the start of every turn to anyone within and whenever someone enters its area. You can move the scythe through the air up to three spaces for free. Scythes occupy a 3 range radius (7 range diameter) circular area. These scythes can never deal damage to yourself, but can hurt allies."
ability,Regent Grey,Derelict Passion,5,2,"Time washes and bleeds over something, causing it to rapidly wither, rot, and become destitute. This can cause items and places to become weak and aged, covered in dust and cobwebs. You have extreme control over how this happens, letting you fuck with even conceptual features of things."
ability,Regent Grey,"Anything You Want, Or Nothing At All",25,2,"Regent Grey uses her strange axiom of existence to mess with the nature of something, causing it to either become true or false. This can bring things into and out of reality, turn effects on and off, and much more."
ability,Regent Grey,Faded Page,?,2,"At any point in the session, you may replace Faded Page with any other ability for the rest of the combat."
ability,Regent Grey,So You Had A Dream About This Place,X,2,"Reality flickers and tears, blurs and blooms like an old black-and-white polaroid being stretched across the memories of time. Regent Grey overlays a new, schrodinger’s reality onto the currently existing one, letting her replace up to X times 9 spaces with the window into a nostalgic place. This replaces whatever it was placed over. You can set the rules of the world to operate differently within this blistered space."
ability,Regent Grey,Monochrome Memory,5,2,"Regent Grey swings her scythe with blinding speed, demolishing a 5x7 area in front of her for 11 damage. This deals double damage to structures and removes terrain effects and ambient powers from the area."
weapon,Sora,Scythe Appendage,,0,"Sora can shapeshift from her palms into a scythe-like bone protrusion, cutting at enemies for 2 damage at 1 range. This weapon also passively lets her climb up almost any surface!"
weapon,Sora,Ally Toss,,0,"As an action, Sora can pick up an ally of the same or less size category as her and throw them up to 6 spaces away! This requires no roll unless she is trying to use the ally as a damaging projectile."
talent,Sora,Sliver Sense,,0,"Even more so than most animals, Slivers have an animalistic intuition that keeps them out of danger, acting as almost a sixth sense. Slivers cannot be surprised, and can get a general “danger sense” on certain people, areas, objects, situations, etc."
passive,Sora,Sliver Queen,,2,"Sora’s epithet allows her to foster the growth of Slivers, strange shapeshifting creatures found across the multiverse. These little fuckers not only reproduce incredibly fast to the point of frequently mutating, but can then shapeshift themselves to have every mutation of each sliver nearby. Sora can command them telepathically as they are connected to her hive. At the start of combat Sora can incubate five sliver hatchlings, rolled for on the sliver table. She gains a new hatchling at the start of her turns (can only hold a max of 5 at a time). During her turn she can “hatch” slivers she has incubated, but only if she has enough Shards to pay for its play cost. Shards are a special resource, representing Sora’s psychic connection to these otherworldly creatures. Sora starts each combat with 3 Shards, and gains 1 whenever a sliver deals damage to an enemy that’s being flanked (one per target per round). Her maximum at any one point is 5. All slivers have at base 2 stamina, a 2 damage basic attack, 5 movement, and can climb most surfaces. In addition, at the end of combat she may mutate a new sliver to be added to the sliver list either now or after the session. She can also mutate new slivers by sacrificing any number of stat increases in return for that many new slivers! There are more rules to creating new slivers on the sliver table. If Sora is unconscious however, all slivers panic before going dormant, waiting for their queen to return."
passive,Sora,Sora Sliver,,0,Sora counts as a sliver.
ability,Sora,Mind Shard,3,0,"A psychic shard of energy pierces an area within 3 range. This shard emits a small 1-3 range aura. Any enemy that leaves the area is hit with psychic damage equal to the number of turns that have passed since it was created (minimum of 5, maximum of 25), dispersing the area in the process. Each shard has an upkeep of 1, but you can have multiple on the field. As a move action, a sliver may switch teleport with a psychic shard. This does not cause it to detonate if it causes an enemy to leave its area."
ability,Sora,Enter The Hivemind,3⛯,0,"A wave of psychic energy covers the field as Sora’s mental domain expands into the physical world. This creates a 3 range aura around herself in which she has perfect senses. When first activated and at the start of their turns, Sora can create “Psychic Slivers” for free. These ethereal slivers cannot leave Sora’s aura and don’t have their own effects, but inherit effects from other slivers like normal. Sora can have up to 2 out at a time. In addition, allies within the area are considered Slivers while inside. Upkeep 3. Once per combat."
ability,Sora,Psycho Shock,3,0,"Sora unleashes a massive burst of mental energy, creating a 2 range explosion of psychic lightning around yourself. This deals 5 lightning damage to all enemies in the area, pushes them out of the area, and temporarily staggers them, making them unable to react in any way until the end of the turn."
weapon,Gervasio,Omnidextrous Assault,,0,"A strike with a highly adaptable limb. This move has a base 6 damage 1 range, however Gervasio can trade out damage for range (cannot be set to have less than 1 damage). Gervasio also gets to choose his hand’s shape and properties, letting him choose what damage type it deals. [18 Prof] +1 Omnidextrous Assault damage"
weapon,Gervasio,Arch Enemy,,0,"Gervasio’s hair itself is highly adaptable and can be controlled with extreme precision. This weapon acts as a copy of any basic weapon used successfully within the last round, except it gains a +1 to damage and range. Once attempted, it cannot be used on the same weapon until it is again seen used successfully."
talent,Gervasio,Natural Selection,,0,"At any point, you may name a damage type. Gervasio's skin adapts, granting you resistance to that damage type for the rest of combat. Once per combat."
talent,Gervasio,Peak Performance,,0,"Gervasio has advantage on all saving throws. (for the sake of this talent, all d20 rolls forced upon you by a negative force in which higher results are preferable are considered saving throws)"
talent,Gervasio,Maxed Stimuli,,0,"Gervasio’s senses are extremely heightened compared to that of a normal human. He has advantage on all sensory checks, and can perform superhuman feats of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste."
passive,Gervasio,Survival of The Fittest,,1,"Upon seeing a feature successfully used, Gervasio may attempt a free roll to slot that feature into an Adaptation Slot. This causes his physiology to be altered in a strange way, granting Gervasio an additional ability or passive that is specially designed to help him counter said feature and/or the person it came from. He can also perform actions / add onto any of his actions additional properties of any one person who he has an Adaptation Slot from. Adapting this way happens after the usage’s effects take place. Gervasio has three Adaptation Slots, and can carry them between combats."
ability,Gervasio,Cross Breed,XY,1,"With this ability, Gervasio morphs his body to replicate and synthesize effects he’s recently witnessed to create a superior ability. This lets him choose two abilities between any that he’s seen used successfully within the last round and ones in an Adaptation Slot, and combine them (either statistically or rhetorically) into one move. Cost is equal to the total cost of both abilities synthesized."
ability,Gervasio,Strength in Numbers,X,0,"Gervasio performs a massive barrage attack, using more of his body and in more ways depending on how much stamina he spends on this. For each stamina spent, choose one: - Perform a basic attack. Hitting a target that you already are hitting with this move halves the damage rounded up, and this will continue to stack. - Add an effect to all the attacks from this move, via altering the shape or properties of your body or just how Gervasio is performing his attacks."
ability,Gervasio,Rapid Hybridize,X!,1,"From his body Gervasio immediately creates a highly elastic limb, This acts as a 5 range tether, after which it disintegrates. You may pay additional stamina to choose the following options. Each option can only be chosen once: Splice - A hand forms at the end of the elastic limb. If it grapples onto a target, then Gervasio may perform a genetic transfer where stats and buffs are exchanged between him and the target. Gervasio chooses the trades. The number and voracity of these changes are dependent on the roll. Detach - The limb detaches from Gervasio, doubling its range. However, instead of being attached to Gervasio, it attaches to another target within 5 spaces of the initial hit one, with that person acting as the caster for these effects. Serrate - Limb deals 3 damage of a damage type of your choice to the target it latches onto."
ability,Gervasio,Theory of Evolution,XXX,0,"Gervasio may choose X number of targets between himself, an item, or a target within 3 range. His epithet then rapidly simulates a specific scenario or environment of his choice thousands of times over, as the targets begin to adapt and evolve at an extreme rate in whichever way makes them best able to survive and thrive in that situation. These alterations take up an adaptation slot."
weapon,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Psychometric Slap,,0,"You’re a thief, not a coward. Slap or sucker punch someone with your ungloved hand, dealing 4 damage at 1 range.

During his movement action, if Jet is out of anyone’s line of sight (ignoring unimportant shit like grass and bugs, and God) he can spend 1 movement to then appear in any other location across the multiverse that also has no line of sight on. He can do this either to move around an arena in odd ways, or to travel to other locations to quickly steal useful items!"
passive,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Plunder Aplenty,,0,"Jet Sterling is able to store various stolen items within the apparatus on his back! With this passive, he can now store items between sessions so long as he can carry them with two hands. He can also store things stolen with his abilities. You can pull out items that are assumed to have been in there from previous heists, though anything other than mundane items will require a roll as a bonus action. This has advantage if you’ve told a story about you stealing this item before."
passive,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",I Have A Reputation For A Reason,,0,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief in The Multiverse, earned his title (probably) and you’re about to see why (probably). Whenever Jet Sterling performs an especially effective action or series of actions, he gains Moxie. He can also gain Moxie when he manages to truly strike the meaning of the name Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief in The Multiverse, into the heart of his enemy. While in Moxie, Jet Sterling rolls with a stacking +2, gains an additional Steal Action on his turns that can be used to do any action of his that involves stealing, and if used on one of his stealing anytimes it doesn’t use its usage for the round. Jet Sterling’s actions also gain a priority effect, making them extremely difficult to stop. Moxie goes away after two rounds, or after Jet Sterling is knocked out."
ability,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Property Poach,3,1,"Jet Sterling extends his hands forwards and robs an object within 6 range of one of its traits or aspects. This removes that aspect from the object while storing it for later use. As a bonus action Jet can either apply the aspect to himself or adjacent things, or create objects out of the “essence” of that trait. If Jet Sterling steals something with Property Poach and applies/creates with it immediately, he can use the same roll as what he used to steal as if doing the whole thing in one action."

While doing so the universe will be too distracted or annoyed, making it so that you can immediately take a move action and pull out something related to the story you’re explaining and then use/apply it. Alternatively, you can instead perform a series of simple actions or a non-ability action, during which everyone will be too distracted to perform any kind of anytimes or reactionary effects until it’s too late. Notably, while this is active everyone within earshot will be focusing on you."
ability,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Thief of Five Fates,2!,1,"Oh, I’m sorry, was that your roll? With this ability Jet steals away the d20 roll of another target, storing it for himself while the other person has to reroll. Does not work on 20s or 1s.

weapon,Reeves,Flashy Kicks,,0,Stylish martial arts that pack a serious wallop. These legs are to be feared. 5 damage as a melee weapon. This weapon suffers no loss in damage when used focused on other non-damaging effects.
talent,Reeves,"Personally, I Prefer The Air",,0,"The sky is Reeves’ domain to control, where no one can contest her style and tenacity. For every ten feet off the ground Reeves is, she deals +1 damage on all of her attacks. This bonus is not increased by To Infinity and Beyond. For every round she remains off the ground, the bonus doubles (additively). This isn’t to say she can’t mix things up; on the contrary, she’s quite good at keeping her opponent in a constant guessing game. Upon landing on the ground, she gains a roll bonus for the rest of the turn equal to double the number of full rounds Reeves was in the air, which ticks down by 1 after every roll. While she has this roll buff she cannot gain bonus damage from this talent."
talent,Reeves,Air Dash,,0,"Reeves can choose to use her Movement Action to “air dash” by producing a wall of air beneath her, allowing her to jump off it and putting herself 1d2 spaces into the air (she can elect to only move up 1 space if she desires). If she does this, she must remain on the same horizontal plane for the duration of the movement action. If she is already airborne when she activates this, she gains +2 movement for the turn."
talent,Reeves,"Prepare For Liftoff, Jackass",,0,"When Reeves inflicts knockback, if she wants, it can bypass typical knockback resistance a unit/target may have granted either directly via mechanics or via size/weight difference. Also, Reeves can choose for any knockback she inflicts to send a hit unit directly upwards regardless of how many laws of physics that may break."
passive,Reeves,To Infinity And Beyond,,2,"Whenever Reeves succeeds an action or ability, she can’t help but try to make it succeed more extremely! Upon the successful roll, she can choose to roll again with a +2 to add on to the success and make it even more potent. This can either double the effect of the move, or alternatively add onto it by significantly augmenting it with air or explosions. She can continue to add rolls as many times as she likes, however, attempting to go for an extra roll and failing makes the entire action fail. The rolls to increase the potency of an action cannot receive any positive or negative modifiers or interrupts from sources other than Reeves herself, and only the initial roll can be countered."
passive,Reeves,Ozone Bubble,,1,"Upon successfully finishing an action using To Infinity and Beyond, Reeves can pay X/2 rounded up stamina to gain an “Ozone Bubble Charge”. X = the number of rolls performed within the chain. An Ozone Bubble Charge has an inherent stat pool of X, with any portion of it being able to be allocated to either damage, knockback, or range (which starts at 1/melee before any allocation). Whenever Reeves performs an action, she can, as an anytime action follow-up, attempt to expend an Ozone Bubble Charge to cause a small burst of air to explode at a target of her choice within the Ozone Bubble Charge’s range. If this fails, the charge is not expended unless To Infinity and Beyond was used in an attempt to boost it. If Reeves desires, instead of creating a new charge at the end of a chain, she can put X stats into a Ozone Bubble Charge she currently has stored, which costs 1 stamina to do."
ability,Reeves,Ephemeral Queen,X,0,"Reeves condenses wind and ozone into whatever shapes she desires, using it to achieve some kind of attack or effect. This ability is especially adept at knockback. This wind construct occupies X spaces, each of which must be adjacent to either another space or Reeves herself. Since these are made of air moving in patterns, it goes away after the action takes place unless Reeves chooses to pay an extra 3 stamina after succeeding the action, in which case it lasts until the end of Reeves’ next turn and is destroyed in a single attack regardless of damage. The power of this move is relative to X. In addition to its other effects, when using To Infinity and Beyond on this ability you may also double X (additively)."
ability,Reeves,Constant Combustion,3,0,"It seems punks like you need to learn who owns these streets. Crackling pure oxygen around her boots, Reeves is propelled into a 3 damage explosive kick which inflicts 1 knockback. The roll for this action explodes on 16+ (even unnaturally). In addition, each follow up or roll exploding acts as an additional kick, with you moving forwards with the knockback to continue the assault. You may use your passive to boost each hit individually, so even if one fails the whole thing doesn’t collapse. However, each time this explodes or follows up with your passive you take 1 recoil damage, and after five hits both parties are set on fire for 1d6 damage at the start of their turns. [25 Prof] Staged Blastoff - For each successful kick from Constant Combustion, you may choose to replace the kick with a different action of yours. These actions have halved effectiveness rounded down, cannot be positively augmented by anything like To Infinity and Beyond, and must be rolled for again. You also must pay stamina costs for any abilities used this way."
ability,Reeves,Vacuum Pocket,1!,1,"Reeves claps her hands together to create a bubble of ozone, which expands out and leaves an airless vacuum within. She can manipulate these bubbles by pulling them open slightly in the right ways, causing her to zoom towards a bubble while inversely that bubble is pulled into Reeves’ previous position. Upon using this, she creates one of these vacuums up to 6 spaces away and switches with it immediately. Reeves can as a 1 cost anytime do the switch with any bubbles on the field that haven’t been switched with yet this round, and has no round limit. Vacuums have 3 stamina and are immune to statuses, and when destroyed they pop dealing 1 damage to everyone adjacent to them. Once per round."
ability,Reeves,Meteorite Kick,2!,1,"Reeves briefly jumps into the air, before propelling herself with an angled divekick at high enough speeds to cause re-entry fires around her legs. This anytime lets Reeves immediately move up to 4 spaces in any direction and smash an enemy as she travels, dealing 3 damage and dragging them with her. Once per round."
ability,Reeves,Galactic Punt,3⛯,1,"Reeves smiles wickedly before unleashing a kick on an unfortunate target. However, it is not any kick, no no. Upon making contact, the target is swept up in a blinding blue light as they are sent flying to the literal stratosphere. They then zoom back down to the battlefield like a meteorite, taking 14 or more damage on impact with the ground. They leave a crater wherever they land, and their next movement is cut in half for the next two rounds. Once per combat."
weapon,Shido,Self Sword,,0,"A sword, seemingly sheathed inside Shido’s own body… or maybe made of her body? Whatever, it deals 4 damage at 1 range."
talent,Shido,Wormhole Hunter,,2,"Whenever you succeed on an action, you may pay 2 stamina and have a shadowy circle appear on the ground somewhere below or adjacent to Shido. As an anytime, you may have Shido be immediately pulled towards the marker at EXTREME SPEEDS, ignoring all terrain. This anytime is a guaranteed success and only needs to roll when used to dodge techniques. This anytime is also once per turn, although if you have multiple of these placed they all share the anytime usage. Lastly, each marker has a 1 stamina upkeep."
talent,Shido,Portable Hole,,0,"Shido has a general hammerspace within her. She can store any amount of items within herself for later retrieval, so long as the items aren’t bigger than her."
passive,Shido,Warp Storm,,0,"Whenever one of Shido’s kit mechanics causes someone or something to teleport, that thing becomes Unstable. Whenever Shido passes between any two things that are unstable, then a shock is created. This deals 1 damage to enemies, and grants +1 range on their next action to allies. The same pair of things can’t trigger this more than once a round. Shido can remove someone or something’s instability as a movement action to teleport adjacent to them, or remove her own in place of paying up to 3 stamina for an ability. Only debuff clearing effects can make you stable again. [39 Prof] I Cause All Sorts Of Problems! - Coming into physical contact with Shido makes you Unstable."
ability,Shido,Floor Master,X,1,"A massive hand made of the same warpstuff as Shido appears above an area within your sight line, before slamming down on an XxX area. This transports everyone and everything grabbed to any other location within Shido’s sight."
ability,Shido,Vector Grab,1,0,"Bonus action. From beneath Shido’s poncho a shadowy hand stretches out and closes its grasp, as a single target within her line of sight is seemingly transported adjacent to her into her grab. This happens regardless of the target’s size."
ability,Shido,Trapdoor,1,0,"A shadow appears on the ground. If an enemy passes through this tile (diagonals count), then a hand will GRAB onto them. This makes them unable to move. If they were suffering knockback, they immediately take damage equal to the knockback prevented, up to a max of 5. Lastly, they also suffer disadvantage on defensive anytimes while grabbed. This grapple lasts until the start of their next turn or until they’re next hit by an attack."
ability,Shido,Contortion Point,1,0,"Shido touches an adjacent ally as they’re filled with spatial energy. This increases the range of all of their attacks and techniques by +2. In addition roll a 1dX, where X is the current greatest range amongst their attacks (capped at d20). If they hit targets that are exactly that many spaces away, the attack deals +2 damage or +1 to any other numeric effect. This effect lasts for 2-3 rounds."
ability,Shido,Alternate Universe,?⛯,2,"Pull from the depths of another alternate reality, searching for a person who will lend you their power and summon them. This ability does not need a roll to succeed, but takes a full round action to perform and afterwards Shido blows harmlessly in the wind and is removed from combat. The person you summon acts as an alternate universe version of another character from ours, with their own (base) kit. They can act immediately when summoned. These people are not 100% conscious of their situation when summoned (the act of being suddenly shifted into another reality does that), taking orders instinctively and not questioning their situation. Any effects to or from them that would be longer lasting go away at the end of the combat. However, our world is fucked up in its own ways. Should any effectively high enough power beings desire it (AKA, the players of DBA), they may choose to break one of these characters free of their shackles and bring them into this world permanently. They can no longer be summoned by this ability, and can be used as a PC or NPC of the person that took them. Doing this to more than one character at a time comes with stipulations, however. This ability is treated as an Outclass level ability for the purposes of copying, and when done so that instance of the ability becomes connected to an entirely different alternate reality. Once per combat."
weapon,The Betrayed,Ten Sword Style,,2,"Remnants of the mythical weapons used to strike you down, you wield a grand total of ten swords. Each sword does a base 4 damage but you gain access to special effects and/or increased damage on the sword of the specific member of the Ten who is currently active, as well as being able to take multiple attacks in a turn as long as you continue to succeed and it is a sword different to the ones you have already used. - Actor - A kendo sword made for the purpose of plays to act in place of a sword, in his own hands it was surprisingly lethal. You have an increased exploding die range of 9+ while using this one. [10 Prof] Choose One of your swords, that sword is now always at full power regardless if their owner is present or not. - Honorable - A proper katana, 8 damage when used against your passive enemy, 6 against anyone else. - Burnt - A sword with their smoking pipe at the base. As an anytime action once per round you can create a dark smoke to obfuscate an attack towards you. - Excellent - A rather expensive and exotic sword from a far off land, it puts a tax on those it cuts for 5 damage, healing you for 2 stamina. [33 Prof] Choose Another One of your swords, that sword is now always at full power regardless if their owner is present or not. - Luxurious - A sword that smells faintly of lilac, as a move action you may take a deep breath to calm yourself down and increase you next roll by 4. - Learned - A blade made of folded paper which causes papercuts, causes a stack of bleed. - Brash - Along with their cutting words The Brash used a cutting sword(which has their own cutting words). Deals 4 emotional damage and inflicts a minus to the target’s next roll.  - Foreigner - A saber made of the stars themselves, does 5 true damage. - Mirror - A simple gladius which obtains the damage and special properties (knockback, reach, status effects. etc) of your current passive enemy. - Assassin - A dagger designed for the express purpose of killing, a critical hit with this weapon that would knock out a target kills them instead."

At the start of combat one character (friend or foe) is selected randomly and you roll a d10 exploding to determine which of the council flows through them, that character gains passive effects relevant to which result(s) you roll. If you get a ten and then get another ten etc they are treated as having each of the highest results until you either obtain all of them or stop rolling ten. Oh by the way, that d10 exploding? Yeah you roll that instead of d20s. You also only get proficiency if you get a minimum of 2 10s in a row(cus nat 20), but at least it's on any roll not just abilities. Also since you still scale off the d20 system getting like a 26 or something means you Over-succeed so have fun with those potential bonuses the rolls will accrue, however your chances for success are much lower than the normal person."

ability,The Betrayed,Legendary Remnants: Tokens of Friendship,1,0,"In the same way that your swords are fragmented replicas of the weapons your former comrades used you can create other items they had. Roll a d10 and pull one out. You can only use one item at a time, this is a free action to pull out. You will learn what each result has as you use this ability."
weapon,Vega,Caledfwlch,,0,"Using her epithet, Vega manifests a large glowing greatsword which she easily swings with one hand, disappearing after use. This deals 5 damage at 2 range."
talent,Vega,Baton Pass,,1,"Whenever a member of the party knocks an enemy prone, they can immediately pass a main action to an adjacent ally."
passive,Vega,Beyond The Boundary,,1,"All allies, including yourself, can stretch the definitions of their epithets much further than usual and perform powers/feats outside of their usual kits through this. Those without epithets instead feel their usual skills enhanced to the extent that they can be pushed past the usual limits of their kits."
ability,Vega,Ride Me To The Moon,X,0,"Using her epithet, Vega tries to send a numeric value “soaring”. Anything changed returns to their previous state at the end of combat, or shorter. Cost is determined by the magnitude of the change, for example "
ability,Vega,Team Building,3,2,"Vega points out two of her teammates (which could include herself) and tells them to figure out a dual tech. She may offer suggestions, but it’s ultimately up to them. They can then both immediately perform it as if they had a movement and action to do it (although they cannot do anything unrelated to their dual tech during this). If they succeed, and the two involved haven’t successfully dual teched through this ability before in this session, they each heal for 2."
ability,Vega,"Up, Up, And Away",1!,1,"With this ability, Vega imbues anything within line of sight with a strange sort of lifting energy to it, causing it to burst upwards into the air and/or begin to float motionlessly. Enemies in the air take slightly more damage than usual. Items set to float in the air remain until jostled with enough force. Meanwhile people can simply float back down at the cost of some movement. Vega herself can disable the floating as a free action. Once per round."
weapon,Atlas,Rocket Sword,,0,"A massive sword, which is actually just a holster for explosives on a stick. Deals 5 damage at 2 range."
weapon,Atlas,Panzer Faust,,0,"Atlas creates a warhead around his fist before PUNCHING a target! Deals 1 damage at 1 range, but gets an additional +1 damage  and +1 knockback per 2 movement Atlas has done this turn, whether from a movement action or otherwise. "
talent,Atlas,Armed and Dangerous,,0,"Whenever Atlas performs a nonmovement action, he can choose to arm an auxiliary warhead on the action. This adds one of the following benefits to the action. However, on a failure or low success, Atlas takes 3 damage via blowback from the explosive. - Move up to 6 spaces in any direction, either before or during the action. - Add up to your movement speed of knockback to an attack. - +3 damage to the attack. - Add a 3x3 3 damage 3 knockback AoE at one of the sources of the attack. Has friendly fire even on Atlas himself. - Add some RP’d effect related to an additional explosive. This explosive can be of different types than just a missile warhead."
passive,Atlas,God of Explosions,,1,"Whenever Atlas lands an attack, he rolls a 1d3. That many miniature explosives appear around Atlas, further adding to his cool factor. Each explosive can be created anywhere within 3 range of Atlas and can have one of the following effects. They cannot stack on top of each other: - Occupants of the chosen space are knocked in a chosen direction 4 spaces. - Occupants of the chosen space take 1 damage. - The explosion ambiently increases Atlas’ style, granting a +1 to all his rolls from this point on. These buffs can stack infinitely, but once Atlas is hit with an attack he loses stacks equal to the damage he took."
passive,Atlas,Containment Procedures,,0,"Whenever Atlas is hit by an AoE and other targets are getting hit by it as well, Atlas may selectively take damage and other effects inflicted by said AoE and redirect them at himself."
ability,Atlas,KO Boomer,2,0,"Atlas dashes up to 6 range in any direction as jets propel him forwards. He then grabs onto a target, creating an explosive on them, and YEETS them in any direction up to 6 spaces in range. This explosive detonates on impact, causing everyone in a 3x3 AoE centered on the target to take 4 damage."
ability,Atlas,Missile Barrage,2,1,"As a passive to this ability, whenever Atlas moves from any source, whether it be a movement action, an ability, or knockback, or he knocks enemies back he generates an equivalent amount of his red stat “Petrol”. Upon activating this ability, Atlas flaps out his cape as tons of missiles fly out from within. Atlas dumps a certain amount of red stat into this and deals damage equal to half of that amount of red stat rounded up to a target within 10 range. Afterwards, Atlas revs some of the remaining energy, spending from what red stat is left on these buffs: - 15: +1 base movement speed and +1 distance travelled on all movement and knockback effects for the rest of combat. - 20: +1 damage to all attacks for the rest of combat. - 20: +1 radius on all AoEs."
ability,Atlas,SEND 'EM TO SPACE!,3!,2,"This ability can only be used after Atlas successfully performs an attacking main action that had no anytimes or anytime effects used during its casting or in reaction to it. In return, this ability can not be reacted to by the enemy or their anytimes. Atlas creates a 5 diameter circular area that has one of the hit targets from the previous attack within it. This space turns into a transcontinental missile which gets upwards into space with the players on it before exploding. This deals 12 damage to the center target, 8 damage and 4 knockback to the targets one space from the origin, and 6 damage and 8 knockback to the targets two spaces from the origin. The targets are also knocked into the air, meaning that until they crash into the floor on their turn they have disadvantage using anytimes. Once per three rounds."
weapon,Devlin,I’m Running Out of Names to Call These Things,,0,"One of the many, many, many knives you’ve bought from the those cool shady dudes at the public marketplace, you know the ones. The problem is they’re all PIECES OF SHIT and BREAK all the time. Luckily you’re just so, *dramatic pause*, skilled at using them, that you make due.

ability,Devlin,Please Don't Use This Ability Oh God,1!,0,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah sure. Just… make *me* deal with it... Due to your epithet, whenever an ally fails a roll, their failure can instead be pawned off to you, causing you to fail your next roll as if you had that roll instead while the allies roll succeeds, although on especially low rolls their ability might still be a little weaker than normal. Once per turn, and can be forcefully activated by allies. But like… please don’t? Please? I’m asking as a friend."

ability,Devlin,Maelstrom of Accidents,2,0,"Devlin snaps his fingers and uses his epithet to conjure up some kind of natural disaster or horrible event to fuck with and decimate his enemies! There’s just one problem: he’s kinda awful at it. Instead of rolling for success, the ability automatically “succeeds”, however instead the roll determines how beneficial and/or detrimental it is for you and your team. 11 and above lean positive, while 10 and below lean negative. Devlin at least gets to choose what kind of disaster it is… right?"

passive,Meridian,Time On My Side,,0,"Meridian’s red stat is her Time. She can spend it on various abilities, as well as to add +2 to her movement for each point spent. You can gain time through the following methods: - +1 at the start of your turn. - Using an ability gives you Time equal to the amount of stamina you payed. [39 Prof] Pocket Watch of Blood - When you would take damage from all attack you get half of the damage (rounding up) as Time. [56 Prof] Man that’s a probably cursed pocket watch with all that blood - You now gain the “half time” effect from all damage you take instead of only from melee attacks."

ability,Meridian,Destructo Dial,1!,2,"Cause versions of an action to phase in from other timelines.

weapon,Palace,The Devil's Handiwork,,0,"Palace is trained in many martial arts that allows him to at least try and put up a fight even without his powers. Deals 5 damage at 1 range. However, when attacking Palace can choose to sacrifice 1 overall damage to split the attack into an additional dice roll. For example, Palace can choose to instead attack for 4 damage via two different 2 damage strikes that are rolled for separately. He can split it again into three different 1 damage strikes since that turns the overall net damage to 3, which is reduced twice from 5 since he’s splitting it into two additional attacks. If an attack split this way would have a base 0 or less damage it isn’t rolled."
weapon,Palace,Worldforger Crucible,,1,"Palace condenses hellish energy into a massive warhammer before bashing it over the head of his enemies. This deals 9 damage at 1 range. This attack is strong enough that it cannot be blocked or weakened, with the only option to avoid damage being to dodge. Lvl 2: +1 damage. The Worldforger Crucible hits so hard that the target becomes dazed, being unable to perform anytime actions until the end of Palace’s following turn. Lvl 3: +1 damage, +1 range. Lvl 4: +1 damage. The daze also causes the target to roll disadvantage on their next action."
talent,Palace,Defy Death,,2,"When Palace would be reduced to 0 or less stamina the first time in a combat, he channels unholy energy to force his soul back into his body and revives with 5 stamina left. Lvl 2: +1d4 healing. Lvl 3: +1d4 healing. If Palace has already used his once per combat revive but has six things unlocked (regardless of level) in his Binding Queue, he can get another revive at the cost of relocking them all at their base level. Lvl 4: +1d4 healing. Upon reviving, Palace begins to take the fight “seriously”, throwing off his cape and gaining a second turn in initiative."
talent,Palace,Power Paradox,,1,"Palace is so in tune with his energy that he can channel it more effectively. If an ability of his is used and succeeds, he gets 1 stamina refunded back to him from the cost. Lvl 2: Abilities of 2 cost or greater refund 2 stamina if successful instead of 1. Lvl 3: Abilities of 3 cost or greater refund 3 stamina if successful instead of 2. Lvl 4: This passive now triggers even if the move fails."
talent,Palace,Original Sin,,1,I'm not fucking copying this one. You get to look it up on palace's sheet.
passive,Palace,"Energy, Bound",,0,"Palace gets all of his abilities and talents from the start. Instead of choosing which to get, you get to decide the “order” of them in his “Binding Queue” at character creation so long as they have a ⌧. While he may have everything in his sheet, Palace doesn’t get access to everything and has to re-unlock his kit every combat if it has a ⌧, a signifier that it is locked by this passive. The first thing in your Binding Queue is always unlocked at level 1 from the start of combat, meaning you have access to it. Whenever you perform a roll or land an attack, you move the “cursor” down the Binding Queue by one. Then, once per round at the start of his turn, Palace gets a point in his red stat, his Unleashing. He can spend Unleashing as free actions on his turn to unlock whatever his cursor is currently over, letting him actually use that part of his kit. If he chooses to “unlock” something he already has, then it is instead boosted up a level to strengthen its effects, with a max level count of 4. Alternatively, he can spend the free action to move the cursor another space down. Once the cursor reaches the end of the queue it loops to the beginning. You get the stamina modifier of the first talent in your queue. When gaining new parts of his kit, if it is signified to be another thing that is locked by this passive, you get to choose where in the queue to slot it upon getting it. Alternatively, you can choose to permanently forego that upgrade to instead get either: - +1 crit range. - +1 movement. - +2 basic attack damage."
ability,Palace,Orb of Iconoclasm,1,1,"Palace condenses occult energy into a powerful sphere of raw energy, before firing it forwards at high speeds! Deals 8 damage at 8 range. Lvl 2: +1 damage, +1 range. Palace can now choose to have the projectile travel across the ground instead of through the air. This means that your opponent can risk it all and roll to dodge the attack for free, but if they fail then you get another follow up action on them. Lvl 3: +1 damage, +1 range. Orb of Iconoclasm can now pierce through targets, although past the first target the damage is halved. Lvl 4: +1 damage, +1 range. While charging the orb, it can still deal damage. Before the projectile is launched, he can have it occupy an adjacent space while being charged, dealing 5 damage to that target. Palace can also choose to not fire it and instead keep it in that spot on him for 1d4 rounds, letting him damage people passively and through movement while moving around."
ability,Palace,The Godpress,3,1,"Palace dashes at full speed towards a target in a straight direction. This lets him move a total of 10 movement speed, grabbing a single target he runs into to slam into a wall or the ground, dealing 5 damage. If against a wall, he can add damage equal to half the unexpended movement to the attack rounded up. Lvl 2: If this ability succeeds Palace can immediately perform another action that isn’t Godpress. Lvl 3: The “movement” of this ability now acts as an infinite range directional attack, meaning you are guaranteed to drag someone to the wall. For bonus damage against the wall, it is now calculated as always being a +5, effectively increasing the base damage to 10. Lvl 4: Before slamming them in, Palace creates some kind of shape or object to slam the target with or into to add bonus effects and increase damage, based on the object used of course."
ability,Palace,Omnipresence Shift,1!,1,"Palace is able to bend space in order to teleport into a location within his line of sight. This can dodge attacks. Once per round. Lvl 2: Can now be used after using an action to make it a “fake out”, letting you perform another main action afterwards. Lvl 3: Becomes a twice per round. Lvl 4: Palace can now passively fly and hover while this ability is at level 4. This ability no longer costs stamina to use."
ability,Palace,Molded Crucifix,2!,1,"Imprinting pure vile energy with his own body, Palace is able to create spectral “copies” of himself that move around and do his bidding. This summons 2-3 of them, each of which can either collide into an enemy for 1 damage or collectively perform a combo technique to dramatically boost another action done by Palace himself or an ally. Lvl 2: The copies can now use weaker versions of abilities and weapons Palace currently has access to. They’re each about the power of ¼th of a usage. Lvl 3: Palace can send out clones to “take” hits for himself or allies. Lvl 4: Palace can overlay a copy on top of someone before turning the clone into solid hell metal. This freezes the target within, forcing them to roll to break out or suffer 1d4 exploding dice suffocation damage."
ability,Palace,Occult Art,3⛯,1,"Instead of being an ability that gets stronger with each level up, Occult Art acts as a new once per combat for each level that it is at. This means that each level’s once per combat usage is separate from each other. Lvl 1: Genocide Wave - Once per combat Palace focuses all of his energy and rage deep within his core before screaming as loud as possible, projecting the energy forwards in a 3xInfinite beam attack. This deals a total of 16 damage, but must be split up against multiple targets. Lvl 2: Wyrmwood’s Corona - Once per combat Palace unfurls wings made of glowing green necrotic energy before unleashing a wave across the entire stage. This deals 8 damage to all allies and enemies in the fight. This move cannot be stopped, blocked, or avoided, and the damage can only be reduced to 4 at its lowest. Lvl 3: Massacre Reaper - Once per combat Palace enters a special stance and dashes up to 6 spaces away. When he connects with his enemy, they’re immediately rushed by a flurry of empowered dark energy attack from all sides, dealing 5d4 damage with exploding dice. Afterwards, the target crumples to the ground while Palace stands strong wreathed in vile power. Lvl 4: Empty Casket - Named after what will be present at the target’s funeral, Palace proceeds to channel enough energy that he activates all three of his other Occult Arts at the same time with this single roll. Once per combat, and costs 9 stamina instead of 3."
weapon,Philyra,Mega Mallots!,,0,"Philyra can summon massive wooden hammers, whose head has a diameter almost as large as she is tall. They reverberate like drums when someone gets inevitably whacked by one. They deal 4 damage at melee range, and your passive is much stronger when being used with this."
talent,Philyra,I’ve Got a Good Rhythm Going,,0,"Everything you do builds up a song in your head! During a round keep track of your actions. If you perform an attack successfully, count that as one beat for the round. After four rounds, save that beat down. You have advantage when rolling to perform that same series again (if you have attacks you need to perform still in a round they get advantage, if you don’t your non-attacks get advantage). If you fail, then you lose the whole thing and have to start over."
passive,Philyra,Gimme a Beat,,0,"All of Philyra’s actions create shockwaves, the intensity of which she decides. Punching, hitting with her hammers, jumping, even her footsteps create shockwaves. She can use this to launch things around with tons of knockback applied to whatever she does."
ability,Philyra,Rhythm Echo,1,0,"Using her soundwave powers, Philyra changes her footsteps in a way to create waves that disrupt people’s perception. This allows her to create many illusory clones of herself. She can make 4-8 of them at a time. Attacking a fake causes it to disappear but deals no damage to Philyra. If you perform an attack, the copies are dispelled and you gain advantage (additive with your talent) and +3 to the damage of the roll. Anytimes trying to interrupt that boosted attack roll with disadvantage."
ability,Philyra,Pinball Panic,1!,1,"After anyone is affected by any kind of knockback, whether it be from any of your own abilities or another source, you can immediately dash to somewhere in front of where they’ll be knocked to and hit them with your hammer, dealing your basic attack damage and reflecting all of their knockback and then some into another direction. If this succeeds, you can do it again, to a maximum chain of two Pinball Panics."
ability,Philyra,Percussion Solo,3,0,"Philyra sets up some mallets like a drum set and goes all out! This lets her channel the energy of the percussive blasts in a more controlled manner. She can create up to three shockwaves anywhere on the map at whatever magnitude and direction she desires to knock things around with. These don’t do damage, but can potentially set up damaging combos. It also knocks anyone adjacent to her back a couple spaces as well due to the intensity of the solo."
weapon,Tryx,There Was No Weapon The Whole Time,,0,"Nothing, but somehow deals 4 melee damage."
ability,Tryx,"Ooh, What Do These Ones Do",1!,0,"Once per round Tryx mixes two chemical formulas together. He can store whatever he makes to use as an anytime later. The issue is he has no idea what they even do! He can mix them in one of two ways: - Vial - Thrown 25 feet, Explodes on contact, causing its effect to everyone on and adjacent to where it lands. - Potion - Swigged to put effects on the consumer. The effect is determined by rolling a 2d8, each d8 is for a different table. https://i.imgur.com/6RwltLI.png"
weapon,Zephyr,The Zeitgeist,,2,"Zephyr wields a massive, curved cleaver segmented into 3 separate segments. These segments can fold into themselves and be rearranged in any order Zephyr desires. Depending on which one is on the end of the cleaver, the weapon gains a special property, but no matter what, it deals 7 damage and has 2 range as a base. Segment changes can be done once per turn as a free action. Zodiac Stance: Ox - When the Ox Segment is at the end of the cleaver, Zephyr can charge up a more powerful slash using an action. While charging, her movement is reduced to 2, but when she releases the slash, she zooms 4 spaces in a given direction. If this manages to hit someone, Zephyr can take another action on that turn. Zodiac Stance: Boar - When the Boar Segment is at the end of the cleaver, Zephyr taps into the boar’s greedy nature and is able to absorb health from her opponents when she damages them. Zodiac Stance: Dog - When the Dog Segment is at the end of the cleaver, its inner guard dog awakens, and Zephyr can now perform one attack of opportunity per round. Zodiac Stance: Sheep - Much like the Drunken Fist fighting style, your seemingly lazy movements are actually preplanned. Whenever someone attacks you but misses while you have this stance, you get a counterattack. Zodiac Stance: Horse - The witty nature of the horse means that after you land an attack, you can roll to do a taunt. If you succeed, the enemy can only attack you for the next round."
talent,Zephyr,High Paying Job,,0,"Being a bounty hunter, Zephyr is aware of all the criminals that are worth a pretty penny. As such, directly knocking out characters that are known criminals nets her an extra proficiency point."
talent,Zephyr,MSRP,,1,"Reduce the cost of all of your abilities by 1, to a minimum of 0."
passive,Zephyr,End of The Alphabet,,2,"No way Zephyr is going down before the bitter end. Due to her Epithet, her fighting spirit is unable to be extinguished unless she is the last person on her team standing, making it so she MUST be the last person on a team to be knocked out. Otherwise, she’ll always hang on with 1 stamina point left. However, if Zephyr knocks herself out in any way, this passive does not save her. Zephyr’s passive now protects her from being knocked out via stamina damage, letting her use abilities AND stay alive. However, this doesn’t apply to her zodiac stances, so if she uses those she will take the one cost and be knocked out."
ability,Zephyr,Z-Slash,3⛯,0,"A glimmer of menacing light shines from Zephyr’s eyes as she performs a quick series of slashes with her cleaver in the pattern of the letter “Z”. Doing this allows her to direct a burst of slashing energy in the same pattern somewhere visible on the battlefield, damaging anyone within it. This blast can be any size Zephyr desires so long as it follows a Z Pattern, with each line being equivalent in size. It deals a sizeable amount of damage and has variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Once per combat. Zodiac Stance: Snake - When utilizing the Snake Stance, the area Zephyr covers is not initially revealed to anyone besides the GM. Instead, it stays invisible until someone walks through it, setting off the trap and dealing even more damage than usual. If someone is standing in the area as the trap is being set, it does not activate due to their presence unless they leave the area and come back. Zodiac Stance: Dragon - With the flames of a powerful dragon at her command, this ability gains a fire element. This makes it so the initial blast isn’t quite as powerful, but it does inflict a Burn Status Effect that deals 1d6 damage at the start of each turn, and the flames also remain on the field after the initial activation. Zodiac Stance: Ox - With this stance, the slash has a dragging property, where it brings any units it hits along the way to the end of its path. Zodiac Stance: Tiger - Your slashes leave marks on your enemies. These “stripes” cause anyone attacking from either end of where the slash is left to deal +2 damage, and the person hit can’t use abilities in that direction (including anytimes). These last for the rest of combat. Zodiac Stance: Rabbit - Zephyr speeds along the Z-Slash’s distance, leaving her at an end of her slash. Zodiac Stance: Sheep - The group mentality of the sheep can be weaponized by the Z-Slash, causing all enemies adjacent to where the slash would be to get pulled into the path of it while it activates."
ability,Zephyr,Zipperwoman,1,0,"Zephyr quickly and discreetly creates a zipper on an object within about 2 spaces of her. From there, she can “unzip” something, allowing her to open any object up and then reclose. She can open and close zippers telepathically and dispel zippers as an anytime bonus action.This has different variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Zodiac Stance: Horse - The speed of the horse allows you to perform this action as a once per round anytime. This includes you using it on your turn, so you can’t use Zipperwoman as your main action and then later that round use this stance to perform it again. Zodiac Stance: Snake - Much like a snake, you can have your created zippers coil around something completely. This allows you to detach that thing into two objects. If you separate the halves and the zippers are still there, you can reattach them, or even attach one half to another set of zippers. Dispelling this makes the change permanent, although living creatures can refuze body parts with some time after combat, and you can always help out and reattach things where they should be. Zodiac Stance: Rooster - Uhh… alarm clocks sure get “in your head” and drive you crazy right? Yeah that’s enough of a connection. Create a zipper across a person and enter them to use them as both cover. You can use your actions to control the other person, although you have to roll for both your movements and actions as this, on top of the actual person having to roll. You share all non-stamina cost damage between the two of you, however the possessed person can spend their action to attempt to reopen the zipper on them and get you out."
ability,Zephyr,Zpeeding Bullet,2!,1,"Zephyr has noticed that, a lot of the time, things that are revving up and/or speeding away make a “ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ” sound. So, she’s decided to use this to her advantage by forcing something to zip and zoom away at an incredible speed. This can be used on herself if she so desires. This has different variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Once per round. Zodiac Stance: Tiger - Leaping like a ferocious tiger, Zephyr uses this on herself to pounce directly towards a chosen unit and grapple them with newly grow claws. Zodiac Stance: Rabbit - This stance causes the target to bounce multiple times instead of simply flying away. This deals slight damage and can get them to areas they wouldn’t be able to otherwise. Zodiac Stance: Rat - Instead of forcing a singular object to move, Zephyr chooses a specific point on the battlefield that forces all nearby units to scatter away from it. The closer they are to the point, the more they are affected. Zodiac Stance: Rooster - Manipulate the astral bodies slightly, either raising or lowering the sun, moon, stars, satellites, asteroids, other planets, or something similar. This can let you change day/night states for some effects, create glints or dark spots to blind people, or even “align the stars” to give an ally a reroll."
ability,Zephyr,Zenkai Boost,3⛯,0,"Tapping into the power within a certain popular anime series that happens to end with “Z”, Zephyr powers up and gains a brand new super-powered form! Her hair will often turn a different color, and she gains massive buffs of her choice. This has different variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Once per combat. Zodiac Stance: Monkey - Utilizing this stance seems to give Zephyr a strange natural inclination towards “Going Super” for some reason, and allows her to continuously power up turn after turn so long as she powers some extra stamina into this ability. Zodiac Stance: Sheep - With this stance, Zephyr’s main boon from this power-up is the growth of a new body part, whether that be extra arms, horns, etc. Zodiac Stance: Dragon - When powering up, seven balls begin swirling around Zephyr, eventually flying into the air and summoning a large dragon. This dragon can either be used as a familiar in combat, or in order to grant a wish. If the GM doesn’t like a particular wish, though, they can deny it."
ability,Zephyr,Zodiac Alignment,3,0,"Release the energy of a single zodiac animal, creating an ethereal version of it that will either perform an action on its own, or stay back and act as a stored buff on herself or an ally to add an effect to an action. When you do this for an animal, then using stances of that animal costs no additional stamina until you use this again with a different animal or until end of combat."
weapon,Mistos,Scalpel,,0,"A tiny scalpel Mistos carries on hand. Deals 3 damage at 1 range, but has a +3 critical hit range."
talent,Mistos,|Rampant Growth|,,0,"At the start of combat at the top of initiative, Mistos chooses one of the following options. Then at the start of the next round at the top of initiative, he chooses one of the remaining two. Then at the start of the round after that the final option is chosen: - Create a twin as described in Monozygotic Fluid. - Take a move action. - Gain a +3 to defensive maneuvers for the round."
talent,Mistos,Regenerative Tissue,,2,Mistos has fast healing 3.
talent,Mistos,Emergency Stash,,1,"Mistos carries with him a series of vials with epithets he’s duplicated with Lexic Twin. By ingesting them, he can gain quite some powers. However, the ones he carries have been specially modified to only have temporary effects, allowing him to gain an epithet’s power temporarily."
passive,Mistos,Mitosis Division,,0,"Mistos’ epithet allows him to rapidly duplicate traits as well as physical things. However, without the help of his mentor his epithet is very slow and only works on the micro level. Given a full day, Mistos can duplicate a small item. By paying close attention, Mistos can notice when certain beneficial traits mutate during division and kill off what lacks those traits to eventually instill it into something. Altering minute traits can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few days, depending on emergent complexity. Anything very large or permanent however can take months, or even years."
ability,Mistos,Monozygotic Fluid,1,0,"Mistos causes runoff cells from his body to split off from himself, and like a swirling liquid it spins around and grows until it forms into an exact duplicate of Mistos himself. The twin shares the same thoughts and senses as the primary Mistos, acting as a second body for the same consciousness effectively. Since this Mistos can shift parts of its body into liquid biological matter and back, it can move through enemies as well as grates and other small passageways, and it has resistance to all forms of physical damage. However, it only has 10 stamina on its own, and for each twin that is still currently alive the ability cost for this increases by 4."
ability,Mistos,|Cell Division|,1!,0,"Mistos molds his body like a liquidy clay or non newtonian fluid, bending it out of the way of an incoming attack before reforming. Once per round."
ability,Mistos,Positive Mutation,2!⛯,2,"Mistos focuses his epithet onto someone. For the rest of combat, a single number on their kit is doubled. This cannot effect his own epithet. Once per combat."
ability,Mistos,|Epithet Cancer|,5⛯,2,"Mistos literally gives your epithet cancer. This either doubles the stamina cost of all your epithet related abilities and actions, or sets them to 3, whichever incurs the most cost. This status lasts for up to three days, but will have its timer refreshed indefinitely if you stay within 100 meters of Mistos. If this status lasts longer than two months, then the user either loses their epithet or they die. Cannot be used on Zander Evergarden. Once per combat."
ability,Mistos,|Lexic Twin|,7,2,"Creating a special large needle in his hands, Mistos jams into an adjacent target and draws… something. Not blood, in fact nothing is “taken” from the original person. Instead, assuming that target is an epithet user, a sort of liquified “genetic” clone of that epithet’s essence is created as the shot is pulled back."
passive,Szilard,"Take It Apart, See How It Ticks",,2,"Szilard’s epithet allows her to take apart anything so long as she understands how it works, even the metaphysical. She is immune to any effects which she understands how they work."
ability,Szilard,Remove Power,3,2,"Szilard focuses on a target, and causes their powers to break down. This allows you to remove any talent, passive, ability, or even weapon from their kit for the rest of combat so long as you understand how it works. If you don’t, the ability automatically fails."
ability,Szilard,Structural Analysis,X,0,"Szilard causes an area up to XxX in size to be taken apart into its bare pieces. This effectively destroys any nonliving, nonsapient, nonequipped items in the area. You cannot be within the area when used."
ability,Szilard,Instant Dismantle,1!,1,"Szilard snaps and a nearby attack breaks apart, cancelling it. Once per round."
ability,Szilard,Reverse Engineer,0,0,"Szilard attempts to recreate an ability which her passive has cancelled. This has a roll debuff, which is decreased the more she understands how the ability works."
ability,Szilard,Disenchant,3,1,"Remove any one debuff or status from an adjacent target. For the next while, you can re-apply the removed effect by using this ability again (you don’t have to, and there’s no limit to the number of stored effects)."
passive,Big John,Harmonic Carapace,,0,"Big John does not have to pay stamina costs for abilities. Whenever it is damaged, it gains 1 stack of Divine Resonance which can be used to boost its abilities (starts combat with 3). Lastly, specifically the front of the head (not the back of the head) has Godly DR 10."
weapon,Big John,Turret Shell,,0,Fires a 6 damage bullet attack at 20 range.
weapon,Big John,Turret Tractor Beam,,0,Each turret is equipped with a tractor beam to grab miscellaneous items with more finesse. This takes a target within 20 range and brings them adjacent to the turret.
ability,Big John,Resonance Lasers,0,0,"From its strange glass-like eyes, Big John fires 2 energy lasers out into the area. These beams ricochet off the air itself to home in on their targets, meaning they cannot be dodged. They deal 5 damage at 10 range each. Big John may spend Divine Resonance to shoot an additional laser each."
ability,Big John,Blade Construct,0,0,"Big John manifests a strange ethereal energy to create a large spectral sword on its area. If an enemy touches the sword, they’re immediately stopped where they are, they’re dizzied, and they take 14 damage. Big John may spend Divine Resonance to create an additional sword each."
ability,Big John,Divine Wave,0,0,"Big John releases an energy wave that covers the entire map, pushing everyone back 3 spaces + 3 spaces per Divine Resonance spent on this."
weapon,Every,Acoustic Guitar,,0,"Every swings with his signature guitar at an enemy. Despite seemingly being made out of simple wood, the thing is virtually indestructible. Deals 7 damage at 1 range, with significant knockback!"
talent,Every,Perfect Form,,0,"Every is immune to poison, is highly resistant to being knocked prone or having his movement hindered, and is immune to the effect of aging and time manipulation."
passive,Every,Spiritual Training,,2,"Every has access to a resource called Ki. He starts with an amount of ki equal to the multiples of 5 proficiency they have, and every time he lands a hit he regains one. Every may spend Ki in place of stamina, and when he does (assuming all stamina was spent with Ki) whatever that payment is going for has its effect multiplied by 1.5x."
passive,Every,Opportunistic Fighting Style,,2,"Whenever an enemy anytime is used, Every either immediately heals for 5 or can attempt a basic attack on a person in range."
passive,Every,Open Palm,,0,"At the start of each of his turns, Every may designate a direction. Any negative effect coming from that direction are automatically parried without a roll, no exceptions."
ability,Every,Lifeforce Spark,2,0,"Every puts a charged hand onto a target, and BURSTS power through them. This sends them flying 10 spaces back and deals a hearty 8 damage. It also messes with their system, causing all anytimes from the target that are using their epithet (if they have one) to automatically fail for the next round."
ability,Every,Absolute Shred,1!,2,"Every jams on his acoustic guitar, which immediately sends reverberations through his body. This lets him immediately dash anywhere within 20 spaces. Three times per round."
ability,Every,Uncontainable Power,5,1,"Raw energy is fired out in all directions, taking the shape of beams of light. An infinite line attack which comes out of all cardinal and diagonal directions of Every, dealing 9 damage. If Ki was spent on this ability, then in addition to the bonus damage Every may combine all of the beams above him after their initial firing, coagulating them into a massive draconic figurehead. This allows him to create any elemental effect anywhere within 7 range of him in a 5x5."
ability,Every,"Write That Down, Folks!",2,0,"Slamming his foot down, a continuity error seems to jolt out into the surrounding area. This allows for Every to alter something about the current scenario so long as it’s a “blink and you’ll miss it” kind of thing that only nerds who pay waaaay too much attention to DBA would notice, for example shuffling people around the map. This limiter is much weaker when using it to just alter yourself."
ability,Every,Akimbo Special,1!,1,"Every shoots with two of the MANY guns holstered on his belt. This deals 4 damage to up to two targets within 10 range. Once per round, but can be used as a main action to ignore that restriction."
ability,Every,Akimbo Akimbo Special,4!,1,"Every shoots with eight of the MANY guns holstered on his belt. This deals 4 damage to up to eight targets within 10 range. Once per round, but can be used as a main action to ignore that restriction."
ability,Every,Superhuman Subdivision,5,1,"Every can throw his shades at an enemy within 10 range. Whether this succeeds, fails, or is messed with, Every’s shades teleport back to his face afterwards. When this hits an enemy, Every immediately appears adjacent to the target as if moving at blinding speeds, and proceeds to “jam out” on their stupid fucking face. This deals 10 base damage, + 2d4 exploding damage. He finishes this barrage off with a massive gambit: the target must pick heads or tails correctly on a coin flip. If they fail, Every capitalizes and does one last 10 damage and 10 knockback hit. Ki must be spent to use this move and no usual multiplier is applied to it."
weapon,Vergil,Yamato,,0,"Vergil’s signature demon slaying sword. Whereas Rebellion can unite, Yamato splits asunder. Deals 6 damage at 2 range, and pierces all forms of passive protection. Its blade can cut through anything, meaning it cannot be blocked or parried, only dodged. If this critically succeeds on hitting someone, then a part of their kit of Vergil’s choice is cut off from them until they can deal 10 damage to Vergil or after two rounds."
weapon,Vergil,Beowulf,,0,Vergil delivers a powerful kick from these light-enhanced gauntlets on his hands and feet. Deals 7 damage at 1 range.

talent,Vergil,Combo Hunter,,2,"No matter the situation, Vergil prefers to keep chains of attacks going on strong for as long as possible. As such, upon landing successful attacks, he can follow-up with extra attacks. This has no cap."
talent,Vergil,I Need More Power,,1,"Whenever Vergil makes a power joke, he makes his next roll with advantage. Does not stack."
passive,Vergil,Devil Trigger,,1,"Every time Vergil does something POWERFUL or MOTIVATED, whether through his actions or otherwise, he gains a few points towards his Devil Trigger Red Stat. Upon reaching a certain amount, Vergil can unleash said Devil Trigger, which greatly increases his movement and damage potential, as well as allows him to fly and regenerate 3 stamina at the start of his turns. Devil Trigger state lasts for two rounds."

ability,Vergil,High Time,1,0,"Vergil performs an uppercut-like maneuver with Force Edge, dealing 5 damage at melee range and knocking the target into the air."
ability,Vergil,Judgment Cut,3,0,"Vergil cuts with Yamato so fast that it cannot be seen, as space itself is rended. This creates an infinite line attack that will deal 20 damage to anyone in its area at the start of Vergil’s next turn. Only Judgement Cut can be used out of this move with Combo Hunter, as it doesn’t technically “hit” immediately even if the line is placed over an enemy."
ability,Vergil,Aerial Rave,1!,1,"Vergil cuts with Yamato at high speeds, dealing 6 damage at 1 range. Once per round."
ability,Vergil,The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour,3⛯,1,"Vergil presses the pause button on his TV remote, causing time to stop momentarily. This allows Vergil to perform an entire round of combat as if he is the only one able to perform any kind of action. Once per combat."
weapon,Arezzo,Omni-Weapon,,1,"A powerful straight to knock ya into next week! Has a base of 7 damage at 1 range, however Izod can utilize her epithet to modify her fists to magnify her attack beyond human limits by spending stamina. For each stamina spent, she can either increase the stats of the weapon by 3 (allocated how she sees fit), or add a single status or weird trait to the attack. She can only spend a maximum of 5 stamina on this weapon."
talent,Arezzo,Epithet Aficianado,,0,"As the creator of the Chimeras and thus the first inventor of a Stygian interface, Arezzo can basically immediately understand someone’s epithet abilities at a glance."
talent,Arezzo,Big Buff Cheeto Puff,,0,"Arezzo is big, and she lifts. She has advantage on all strength checks, can perform physical feats of superhuman proportions, and is a 2x2."
passive,Arezzo,Rough Draft,,1,"At the start of Dr. Izod’s turns, she may spend any amount of stamina she chooses. For each stamina paid, she can make a small alteration to herself, or her kit. These can be stacked together to create larger alterations if she chooses. She can’t spend more than 3 stamina in a turn with this, and caps at 25 current changes. Changes go away at the end of combat."
ability,Arezzo,Revision Notes,3!,2,"Izod’s epithet collapses around a target, permanently altering a part of their kit. Izod cannot use this on herself. The extremity of this alteration depends on the time dedicated to this. An anytime change is very small. Inversely, if given a couple months an ability could be completely rewritten. Power level of changes can only stay roughly the same, be a sidegrade, or make it weaker. If a target wants, they can pay a combo of total 15 max stamina and/or proficiency to make the change only apply for the combat instead. Once per round."
ability,Arezzo,Scribble Prison,3,0,"Charging her arms with her epithet, Izod touches both to the ground as pencil scribbles cover the entire floor. This creates barbed wire that covers every tile on the arena. Anyone who moves over one takes 1 piercing damage for each step they take. Barbed wire lasts for a round."
ability,Arezzo,Cannon Fleet,X,0,"Izod makes X steps, leaving a cartoonish cannon with a short fuse in her wake pointing in a particular direction. Then, at the end the tip of her pointer finger is erased and turned into a barrel as she fires a bullet to ignite all the cannons to fire at once! Each cannon deals 8 damage in a line, although the bullets do not pierce. The cannons are destroyed from the force."
ability,Arezzo,Bombs Away,1,1,"Arezzo throws 2d6 (minimum 4) comical bombs up to 9 spaces away. The bombs can do one of two things: detonate immediately, dealing 4 damage in a 3x3 where it landed; OR the bomb can stay and count down. Each turn that passes increases its inevitable damage, capping at 15 damage after 11 turns after which it’ll automatically explode in a 7x7 instead. These bombs cannot damage Arezzo herself."
ability,Arezzo,"FUCK YOU, TANK",3,0,Arezzo drops a 7x7 tank somewhere on the field. Recharge evens.
ability,Arezzo,Post This Rat,1,0,"Arezzo creates a rat soldier. This fucker has a tommy gun that deals 6 damage at 6 range, and has 8 movement speed. It also gets a dodge roll against any and all incoming attacks, completely avoiding the attack on rolls equal to or above the enemy check. The rat always rolls advantage except on their dodge rolls. Can be used as a bonus action once per combat."
ability,Arezzo,BALANCE PATCH!,5⛯,2,"Everyone in combat can only use one anytime per round of any type. This is tracked by player, not unit. In addition all anytimes roll with a -3. Once per combat. However in return Arezzo loses boss action economy on her turns."
ability,Arezzo,Field of Blades,3,0,"In a 10 range cone, Arezzo stomps the ground as her epithet creates knives and serrations along the ground in that area. Everyone there takes 7 damage. The area stays on the field and deals 2 damage whenever someone starts their turn in the area"
ability,Arezzo,Making A Mockery of You,3,1,"Arezzo creates a copy of a single person on the field with her epithet. This ability has a once per combat variation where she can create copies of X people, where X is an additional stamina cost to the ability. Those copies have stamina equal to 20 instead of dying in one hit like most of your constructs"
ability,Cannae,Supreme Slash,5⛯,0,"Once per combat Cannae performs an ultimate slash by spinning the blade in her hand 180 degrees while slashing at full power. This combined with the sword's power causes everyone within a 20 space radius of Cannae to be cleaved for 16 damage, piercing all DR. She can warn people to get out of the way beforehand to save her allies, but they have to hear the message."
ability,Cannae,Whirlwind Fates,7⛯,1,"Cannae spins her blade extremely fast in her hand while performing 7 successive wide strikes. This causes, each anywhere along the screen, line attacks to appear. The first is a 7xInfinite, and their width decreases with each. Each deals 5 damage. Once per combat."
weapon,Gamer Gabby,Gamer,,1,"Instead of attacking with just any old weapon, Gamer Gabby can pull out any kind of gaming peripheral ever made. She’s able to embue it with gamer energy to act like its gamer purpose in real life. This is basically an ability that you don’t have to choose and doesn’t cost stamina."
weapon,Gamer Gabby,Wiimote Light Saber,,0,A wiimote with a beam of light flowing out the end. Deals 7 damage at melee range.
weapon,Gamer Gabby,GAMER ENERGY,,0,"Pure gamer essense fired from your palms like a fucking energy sphere or kamehameha wave. Deals 10 damage at 10 range but can only be used if you have 2 or less stamina remaining, as it is a secret forbidden gamer art only usable by elites for dire situations."
passive,Gamer Gabby,The Most Oppressed Group of All,,0,"If a glass ceiling is nearby and becomes broken, then Gamer Gabby can fly, has 10 movement, and deals triple damage until end of combat. In addition, whenever Gabby performs or is witness to an epic gamer moment, her red stat goes up by some margin determined by the GM. Once it reaches 100, the pure gamer energy crystalizes into gamer sweat, which vaporizes the Veil and reveals one of the many glass ceilings above all gamers. In The Zone - Gamer Gabby gets a +1 to damage for each 20 points stored in her passive."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Rise Up Gamers,2!,1,"Tell something to rise up, even yourself. It will do so. Once per round."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Infinite Shareware,1,0,"Gabby can install Fortnite or any other game she can think of onto an electronic she sees, including the phones of her enemies. This causes the device to start performing some kind of effect based on the game, like an assembly line suddenly creating blocks when installed with Minecraft. However, only consoles and gaming PCs are able to handle the full brunt of this, so installing this on lesser devices gives them a small chance to have a thermonuclear detonation due to overheating."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Save Scum,2!,1,"Reload from your previous save, resetting your stamina and position to what it was at the start of your last turn. This does not give you your actions back, but it also doesn’t reset your actions to others you’ve performed, just resets yourself. Once per round."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Guess What I Bought?,2,0,"Gamer Gabby has access to an absolutely gamer assortment of snacks and beverages. With this ability she can cause any kind one of those to suddenly appear in any location within 8 spaces of her. For example, she can cause an area to fill with doritos to make a hazardous area for people to walk. All of these can be consumed for health, but others will only gain 1 stamina back when they do. Only gamers can understand the full nutritional value of these glorious meals to heal the full amount."
passive,Gamer Gabby,I Am [sans.],,1,"At the start of combat, Gabby can choose a single character from a video game. She can perform any of their moves or use their powers. However, if those powers are higher than Gabby could reasonable attain with her current proficiency, the powers are significantly nerfed, so choose wisely you FUCK."
passive,Gamer Gabby,Video Game Logic,,0,"You can interact with reality using logic that doesn’t actually translate to reality and only really makes sense in video games, like all enemies dropping money even if their wild animals, or food healing you even if realistically that’s not how food works, etc."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Gamer Lore,3,0,"Gabby is able to take an easter egg or urban legend about a game or its development and cause it to come to life, bending to her will!"
weapon,Vegas,Dev Tools,,0,"These weapons do nothing usually. However, if used targeting some kind of electronic or while within a simulation of some kind, it allows him to alter a component within that realm. This also works on all of Vegas’ summons since they’re lore-wise game constructs."
ability,Vegas,I Just Like Talking About My *Favorite* Game,3!,1,"Interrupt some people to talk about your FAVORITE GAME, causing it to come to life and interrupt whatever the people were doing. Once per round."
ability,Vegas,Crossing The Code,3,0,"Change the coding of a person or object, altering, adding, or removing its behavior."
ability,Vegas,Invisible Wall,1!,1,"Vegas creates an invisible wall of any size, often used to block an attack and stop people from moving somewhere. The target wastes their movement as they bump into it trying to find the edge, however it’s also pretty easy to glitch through the walls if you think about it. Once per round."
weapon,Samantha,Scalpel,,0,"A small scalpel. Deals 5 damage at 1 range, and can inflict bleeding on high rolls. Can also be used to freely cut up living tissue with ease."
talent,Samantha,Can I Have A Volunteer?,,0,"If a target is willing, you automatically succeed at using your scalpel to dissect the target. You can also choose to cause the dissection to deal zero damage."
talent,Samantha,Sicko Mode,,0,"Samantha gets a little too involved in her work sometimes. Whenever she crits, she can perform an action immediately."
passive,Samantha,A Live Dissection,,1,"As Samantha cuts things apart, she starts to understand their physical makeup better. Whenever you succeed in an ability or action that involves cutting someone open or creating a wound in them, you can choose to either: - Gain advantage on using one specific ability against that specific target forever. - Learn their epithet if they have one. - Learn their weak points, giving you an expanded crit range against that target by +1 forever."
ability,Samantha,Snitches Get Stitches,1!,1,"Samantha causes needle and thread to manifest within someone that’s in 8 spaces of them. She completely controls these threads and can have them either sew up wounds in the target’s body for around a 6-8 stamina heal, or she can have the sewing needles take other nearby objects and stitch them onto the target’s body, for various purposes. Once per round."
ability,Samantha,Splay The Flesh,3,0,"Samantha sharpens her scalpel, and a split forms on something or someone within 2 range. This deals around 7 damage, and leaves a rift in the thing. On people this can be used to create a weak point that will make them take more damage, mess with an organ to cause some kind of failure in the system, or cause the target to start bleeding for a damage over time effect. Surprisingly, the target will not feel any pain during this process despite the damage."
ability,Samantha,Beyond Human,3,0,"Samantha takes out a machine and implants it into an adjacent person, cutting them open before closing the wound around the device. This gives the target some extra cybernetic functionality. What they get is chosen by Samantha."
ability,Samantha,"Go, Squeakums!",1,0,"Samantha pulls out one of her pet cybernetic rats. They have 5 stamina, 6 movement, and have both a 4 damage melee attack and a 2 damage 8 range laser beam attack. They also self-reassemble, healing 1 stamina a turn. If one dies, Samantha can use Snitches Get Stitches to straight up revive them from death as long as most of their pieces are still around."
ability,Samantha,Better Biology,3,0,"If Samantha has had her passive trigger on a target, then she can use this ability to change their internal form in some way. This alters the shape and positioning of their organs to change how they operate. While yes, this ability can be done to cause severe internal damage or weaken a target, it can also be used on an ally to significantly boost their power, making them effectively superhuman in biology. Against especially powerful targets this effect will likely not last forever. Once per combat."
weapon,James,L33t-T0P,,0,A hacker laptop that can hit in a melee range for 5 damage.
talent,James,PC Optimizer Pro,,0,Immunity to slow down or movement debuffs. Applies to you and any allies within 6 range (30 ft.)
passive,James,Tab Master,,0,"Whenever James uses a 3 cost ability, he can take something from the current scenario (whether it be an item or effect) and put it off to the side in a tab for later. These, unfortunately, tend to stack up pretty fast, so he needs to frequently go through them and close them. He can go through and check on any of his tabs to close it, which either boosts an action of his in a related way to the stored thing, or lets him summon another instance of the stored thing. However, he has to worry about using up all of his ram on these tabs, so if a roll of his is equal to or less than the number of tabs he has open he bursts into flames. This deals 1d4 damage to him over time, and can spread."
ability,James,The Google Game,X,0,"James opens a new tab and types in three characters into google incognito mode. Your choice of one of the first three autocomplete results is searched and summoned, and if a more suitable image is not found the first result for that on google images represents it. Cost is dependant on what is summoned as chosen by the DM."
ability,James,The Wiki Game,3,0,"Open up Wikipedia and access a randomly selected page. Whatever appears James manifests as an ingame effect, beneficial or not. Effect needs to be vaguely related to the page. Can only be used again after combat or when the effect is dispelled/destroyed."

ability,James,Government Secrets,1,0,"James taps into the data of a single enemy, learning some history and facts about them. High rolls can describe their abilities or even reveal a weakness. Low rolls provide information of questionable validity. "
ability,James,Close Your Tabs You FUCK,3,0,"James decides to thuroughly break the fourth wall by looking at zanza’s very window and picking a tab he has at random to close. This is chosen with a 1dX, where X is the number of tabs he has open in whichever window has the most tabs.

passive,Nova,Supernova Perseverance,,0,"Nova’s red stat is her Wrath. Everytime a source deals 5 or more damage to her, Nova may add +3 to her Wrath for each multiple of 5 dealt. If it’s less than 5 damage, she gains +1 Wrath. She may spend this like stamina to use abilities. Nova starts combat with 5 red stat."
ability,Nova,Sakuga Moment,1!,1,"Nova makes a move flashier with a higher animation budget, adding +d8 to a roll."
ability,Nova,Galica Cannon Type: ~THIS~,2,0,"Nova’s Moonbuster unfolds and shifts itself in an overly complicated way before shooting something out. Roll a d1000 to determine what is launched at 8 range. Even if the roll to hit fails an object is always created. Failed rolls create the object at the barrel of the gun with no momentum, immediately dropping right in front of Nova unless specified otherwise. Effects are probably until end of combat."
ability,Nova,Giga Beam Buster,3⛯,0,"Nova charges an incredibly powerful beam attack. Too bad it’s so slow. The attack only goes off at the beginning of her next turn, but hits everything in a straight line 25 feet thick (two spaces to each side of the line which she is firing). Infinite range, deals 16 damage with friendly fire. Cannot perform a move action while charging. Once per combat."
ability,Nova,Storage War,3,0,Add an object you’re touching to your Galica Cannon list. Permanently.
ability,Nova,Death Flex,1!,0,Nova can flex the muscles on her upper body so hard and fast that it creates a shockwave. This knocks anyone and anything adjacent to her one space back and softens the blow of incoming attacks especially projectiles. Rolls 17 and above even negate attacks entirely. Only works on attacks going towards Nova and that can be theoretically repulsed.
weapon,Dean,Worst Sellers,,0,These books have a habit of not selling so you just give them away. By force! Deals 5 damage at 4 range.
talent,Dean,No Refunds,,0,"Once someone obtains one of Dean’s books, they can never get rid of it. By using some savvy marketing and legal binding contracts you’ve now made it so that anyone who even touches your book legally accepts it! This means your basic attack counts for your talent. It also means that you can choose to say where you throw the book at (for a minus 3 roll penalty) to make it really difficult for a person to properly use that part of their body."
passive,Dean,Ghostwriter,,0,"Dean obviously can’t write himself, but he “luckily” doesn’t have to! A spirit named Dan is chained to Dean at all times, which has above average writing ability. Dean can force it to write anything he wants, creating any written document or piece of paper, book, etc. as a once per round free action. "
ability,Dean,"It's Called ""Inspiration""",1,0,"This ability is replaced for the rest of combat with any ability Dean has ever seen done successfully, at 1.5X stamina cost rounded up. The ability is rephrased for legal reasons (this is just for flavor). You can never use an ability you’ve copied ever again."
ability,Dean,Who Needs An Editor?,1!,0,"Dean creates a typo, adding, removing, or changing a character (letter, symbol, space, ect) of anything. Anything. Effects are as far-reaching as Dean intends. Infinite range. Once per combat this can be used to add, remove, or change a full word. Dean can only mess with numbers by increasing or decreasing them by 2, can’t take them below zero, and can’t effect stamina costs except on high rolls. Can be used as a once per round anytime, but using it as a main action does not consume this usage."
ability,Dean,Dean Stu To The Rescue,3,1,"Dean’s such a good protagonist, he has a second epithet! Roll six random words and choose one. This ability is replaced until end of combat with a new ability themed around that word, as if Dean had that new word as an epithet."
ability,Dean,Original Characta,3,1,"Dean targets one person he can see and writes a rough draft of his newest character. This character with a Completely Original name and theme is then summoned. He can only have one OC summoned at a time because giving more than one Character proper focus is way too much work and each Summon has 8 stamina. Summons may use slightly altered versions of their inspiration’s Abilities, the changes being related to whatever creative license was used in their conception."
weapon,Emrick,Dual Demon Pincer Attack,,0,The full fury of two giant lobster claws. Emrick has learned how to really make them sting. 5 damage 1 range.
talent,Emrick,Scary Swimmer,,0,Emrick gains 1.5x movement while swimming.
talent,Emrick,Elemental Bending,,0,"The eldest of vampires gain the power to bend an element, and Emrick is no different! Emrick now has the power to create and bend water to a limited extent, and add it to actions he performs for small bonus effects."
talent,Emrick,Blood Transfusion,,0,"Instead of draining blood from others, Emrick can transfer his own will to another through a bite! He may heal them for any amount of stamina he so chooses, so long as he pays twice the stamina he gives. Doing this is a bonus action, requires you to be adjacent to the target, and they must willingly accept the gesture, however it requires no roll. Warning: if this is used to heal someone for 20 or more stamina, there’s an increasing chance they may catch vampirism themselves."
passive,Emrick,Lucky Cape,,2,"When Emrick is standing adjacent to an ally, his cape produces a lucky aura, granting them a +5 to all non-attack rolls. (Prof 42) Luck Goes Around - Emrick can now “pass on” his lucky cape, essentially transferring his passive onto a willing adjacent ally and allowing them to gain its effects constantly."
passive,Emrick,Future Providence Over The Entire World!!!,,2,"Whenever Emrick or an ally rolls a Natural 20, Emrick gets a +1 to all damage (before crit multipliers) on all his attacks for the rest of the session!"
passive,Emrick,The Undying Breed,,2,"The (fake) immortality of the Lobster and the (real) immortality of the Vampire have fully combined! If Emrick were to drop below 1 stamina, he can roll to resist. Anything 8 and above heals him for the number rolled on the dice. If he rolls less then he stays unconscious until healed back by other means. There is no limit to how many times this can happen. If Emrick crits on this roll, he fully heals."
passive,Bara Bara No Mi,"Knives, Swords, Useless! The Lot of Them!",,2,"Emrick is immune to piercing and slashing damage, and when exposed to such damage, may have a body part of his separated from the main body and can move it as a free action on his turn up to 30 feet from his body. If it gets taken out of that area, he loses control of it and can still be damaged from said body part. Once per Turn, Emrick gets an extra action from a body part that isn't connected to his main body. (The Devil’s Power Grows 2) Instant Split - Emrick can split himself along any axis of his choice as an unrolled Movement Action."
ability,Emrick,Rock Lobster,3⛯,1,"Calling upon the dark power welled within him, Emrick summons a giant statue of a lobster that falls down onto a 3x3 area and stays there for the rest of combat. If it lands on an enemy, it deals 12 damage and can trap them under it on high rolls. Once per combat. (Prof Upgrade) Ever Encroaching Darkness - Rock Lobster no longer gives the targeted units a counter roll on activation. (Prof 59) Continued Assault - Emrick can continue to punch down the Rock Lobster onto enemies for an additional 10 damage against anyone pinned under it as a Main Action, at the cost of destroying it. (Prof 66) Stone Hard Will - Rock Lobster now deals +2 damage (10 to 12). (Prof 79) Leader’s Symbol - If the Rock Lobster is on the battlefield, Emrick can once per round grant advantage to any ally, so long as they can hear his words of motivation!"
ability,Emrick,Exoskeleton Safeguard,1!,1,"Emrick puts great faith and trust into his teammates, so naturally, he doesn’t want to see them hurt. Thus, he can jump in front of an ally right before they take damage, hardening his lobster exoskeleton an extreme amount so that he takes half of the original damage. When Emrick is using Heat Riser, this ability completely negates the damage of the blocked attack. Once per round. (Prof 46) Rallying Call - Emrick does more than just protect his comrades, he inspires them! Whenever he uses Exoskeleton Safeguard to protect an ally, that ally gets advantage on whatever their next roll is."
ability,Emrick,March of The Mollusks,3,0,"Vampires have an innate ability that connects them to vermin. However, seeing as Emrick is cursed, this ability has transformed into a connection with lobsters specifically. Taking advantage of this, Emrick calls upon his crustacean comrades to charge with him as he transforms into a swarm of “lobats”. This allows him to have another Move Action and to drag units along with him, dealing 2 damage for each space traveled. Transforming back to his normal form acts as a Bonus Action on his turn. Due to a combination of the swarm spreading Emrick’s mass into smaller segments and Emrick’s realization of Heat Riser’s long term repercussions to his health, any damage boost from Heat Riser is only added at the end of the attack, as opposed to being applied for each space moved. (Prof 55) Evasive Swarm - While in March of The Mollusks form non-AoE attacks against him roll with disadvantage, because as it turns out it’s quite hard to hit a swarm of lobats."
ability,Emrick,Heat Riser,X,2,"“Wasn’t that flaming hot?!”. Emrick uses vampires’ innate ability to turn into fog and combines it with lobster related experience to generate a massive amount of heat. This causes an aura of power to swell around him as steam is expelled from his body.  When activating this ability, Emrick chooses how much stamina he wants to use, and he then gains +X*2 on all damage he deals and +X to his movement. If he wants, he can activate this ability as a bonus action, but doing so halves the buffs gained. He must also pay an upkeep cost of X stamina at the start of his turns to maintain this form regardless of the variation. If he fails to use this ability, he pays 3 stamina no matter what."
ability,Emrick,Space Ripper Stingy Eyes,3,0,"Emrick shoots scalding salt water from his eyes like a pressurized hose, dealing 6 damage as a 1xInfinite line attack, with +3 damage against legendary heroe- I mean units Class 2 and above."
ability,Emrick,Emperor's Eye,0!,1,"Emrick glares down at an enemy with the might and confidence of the future tyrant of the entire world, as his vampiric powers assert influence over the target. This causes any enemy who can make direct eye contact with Emrick to be instantly knocked prone. Once per Round."
ability,Bara Bara No Mi,Chop Shop,1!,1,Emrick can take any amount of his split off pieces and reconstruct them into a new form with some minor new benefit to suit it. Undoing this is a Free Action.
talent,Emrick,The Curse Controlled,,0,"By paying an extra 1 stamina, Emrick can let his curse envelop an action of his to add some kind of lobster-y effect to it. However, if you do this and your action fails you will be forced back into your Lobster curse kit until the start of your next turn."
talent,Emrick,Vampire Regeneration,,1,Emrick has fast healing 2.
talent,Emrick,Flight,,0,Emrick can fly at will.
talent,Emrick,Vampire Speed,,0,Emrick has doubled movement speed
talent,Emrick,Levitation,,0,"Emrick can levitate and control small objects with his mind. He can use this as a bonus action, or he can control items of much larger size as a main action (although not much larger than a 4x4)."
talent,Emrick,Raven Familiar,,0,"Emrick has a raven familiar! It has 10 stamina, 7 movement, and a 1 damage melee peck attack. It can be used for recon as the two share senses and it can communicate telepathically to him."
talent,Emrick,Child of The Night,,0,"Every vampire knows how to use darkness to their advantage, and thus, he can essentially vanish in dark areas, making him essentially invisible. Activate as a Bonus Action, and requires a roll to not take down whenever he’s hit. Obviously goes away immediately if the area he’s in becomes lit."
passive,Emrick,Infinite Ambition,,2,"Emrick Rallavar is filled with an ultimate ambition: to become a leading figure in the world, his own definition of tyrant, for the good of his friends and the rest of the world. Because of this, Emrick can push himself past his usual physical limits, and thanks to his vampiric physiology he suffers little pushback. Upon successfully performing a Main Action, Emrick may choose to push himself. If he does, then he rolls a die and takes that much irreducible damage, and can immediately perform another main action at lesser effectiveness so long as it’s different to any other action he has performed this turn. However, doing that also grants Emrick a level of Fatigue. The damage die he rolls depends on his current Fatigue. He loses 1 Fatigue at the start of his turns and whenever he supports an ally. In addition, if Emrick crits on an action, then he does not take damage for pushing himself beyond it. Upon pushing past 5 Fatigue, Emrick will be forced to choose: he can be forced to take a rest which immediately ends his turn, or he can enter Burning King state. In this state Emrick’s double movement becomes quadruple movement, he can move-act-move, and the sheer heat of his blood and soul allow him to add fire properties to any of his abilities, increasing their damage by +5 and potentially having other effects if flavored right. However, this also causes Emrick to take 10 damage a round until he is knocked out or reduces his Fatigue to 0. This damage cannot bring him below 0. If Emrick somehow instead goes even further beyond and hits 10 Fatigue, he can enter Infinite Shade Emperor state. In this state, Emrick can take two main actions and move actions whenever he pushes himself, gains eight times movement instead of quadruple, rolls advantage on all rolls, and gains special hidden critical effects on all his rolls. This stays until he is knocked out or reduced to 0 Fatigue. Emrick can potentially push himself even further hypothetically... - 1d2 - 1d4 - 1d6 - 1d8 - 1d10 - 1d12 (damage caps at this level)"
ability,Emrick,Tyrant Lance,1,0,"Emrick runs up and kicks an enemy to the floor, sliding along the ground as their face is grinded against the pavement. This ability is combined with Emrick’s movement. Once contact has been made with the enemy, both Emrick and the target will slide forwards for the rest of their movement spaces as the enemy takes 1 damage for each space traveled. They are also knocked prone due to the process. The Infinite Ambition damage die to push forwards after this technique caps at a 1d8."
ability,Emrick,Cyclone Twister,3,1,"Imbuing one of his swords with dark magics, Emrick swings as hard as he can to create a spinning tornado. This acts as a 3x3 which he can then move up to 8 spaces, hitting every area that it covers before disappearing. This tornado deals 8 damage to everyone it passes through, and drags them along its path. (4) - When using Sable with Cyclone Twister, the twister becomes an animated black being of swirling ash. This causes all spaces it passes through to be covered in black fog."
ability,Emrick,Cross Chariot,3,0,"Putting both Cherry Rain and Sable together, Emrick performs an X slash attack which travels through the air as a 3x8 piercing projectile, dealing 6 damage to all those hit. In addition, Emrick can move along with the projectile however far he wants, using the black fog as cover. If this technique hits three or more targets, then pushing forward past it with your passive incurs a damage die one size less. The same is true if you move to the very end of the travel distance, which can stack with the previous effect."
ability,Emrick,Swashbuckling Clash,3!,1,"This refined dueling technique is a guaranteed success parry of an incoming blow, as you bat away an incoming attack with both swords. However, your foe may choose to contest this parry instead of letting you style on them. If they do, they must roll higher than your roll to use this ability, and if they fail then you get an immediate attacking riposte action back at them (which cannot be pushed with Infinite Ambition) and your next Infinite Ambition damage die is reduced by one size category. If they succeed, then they simply get through for slightly less damage then would’ve been initially dealt.  Once per Round."
ability,Emrick,Mirage Step,2!,1,"Using your mystical vampiric lineage, you can confuse targets into seeing the mirage of another attack. By activating this, you can change any action you are currently performing into any other action you could perform at that time. This causes any parries/defenses/anytimes that were targeting the original to be discarded as they were only combatting a mirage, and you choose to either keep the original action’s roll or use this anytime’s roll for the replacement. Once per Round."
ability,Emrick,Ship Cutter,5⛯,1,"Emrick jumps forwards with both swords held together, before performing a legendary slash which he was famous for: the Ship Cutter. This attack deals 15 damage in a 9x9 area centered on Emrick himself, or he can do the attack vertically to make it go 4 spaces in front and behind him. It can cut through even steel, and will destroy most structures instantly. However, this technique is very dangerous as it can potentially damage his own allies in the process. Once per Combat."
ability,Emrick,Bewildering Mist,1,0,"Emrick vanishes into a 3x3 cloud of mist, and, after a moment, he and all objects and/or units in the area are repositioned to spaces within 4 of Emrick’s current position. Bonus Action."
ability,Emrick,Gale of Darkness,3,2,"Emrick flourishes his cape, casting a shadow that forms into up to 2 “Heralds of Darkness”. Heralds of Darkness have 7 stamina on average, and can perform weaker versions of Emrick’s actions. There is no limit to the amount of Heralds of Darkness able to be on the field at a given time. Heralds of Darkness become inert while in Lobster Curse form."
ability,Emrick,Midnight Resolution,4,1,"Emrick snaps, and a 4x4 area of his choice becomes subsumed in an infinitely dark black hole. Units inside have no choice but to watch as the seemingly pulsing area is pierced with countless blood spikes, dealing 10-13 damage in the process. With its final strike, the black hole explodes, sending all units inside flying in a direction of Emrick’s choice. This attack does increased damage to summons, and passes through DR."
ability,Emrick,Blood Drain,1,0,"As a vampire, you can drink the blood of your enemies. Doing this restores 1d6+1 stamina, and deals that much damage to the drained unit."
weapon,Geist,Lollipop Chainsaw,,0,"Geist reaches into her endless bag of candy and pulls out a lollipop. This lollipop then expands and transforms into a chainsaw scythe, perfect for rousing spirits. 3 damage 2 range. Trickster Spirit - Lollipop Chainsaw now has its damage and range tripled. (Prof 37) Harvest Moon - As the light of the moon on Halloween night glints off her, she seems to actively harvest from her surroundings. While Geist is in Trickster Spirit form and she deals damage to an enemy with her scythe, she can choose to either heal 3 stamina or “steal” an aspect of whatever she hit, getting a buff for herself. This only applies once per round even if she hits multiple people, and only triggers if she hits with the 2 furthest spots of its range (this sweet spot increases by 1 for every range upgrade Geist picks to compensate for bigger scythe)."
talent,Geist,Spooky Squirmings,,0,"Due to Geist’s origins as both a scarecrow and a spirit, she is able to bend her body in ways that normal people can’t. This makes her very flexible and allows her to squeeze through just about any crevice."
talent,Geist,Sweet Tooth,,0,Geist’s body seems to derive energy from Halloween itself! She gets an additional +2 healing whenever she eats any kind of candy.
talent,Geist,And Who Might You Be?,,0,"Geist gets a great joy from guessing what someone is! She gets an additional +2 proficiency whenever she successfully guesses someone’s epithet (or equivalent), on top of the usual rewards."
passive,Geist,Devil's Night,,2,"Geist always has the spirit of Hallow’s Eve swirling around inside of her, and as such, her mask is usually used to contain it all in one place. However, if Geist is able to utilize her power to its fullest, it can make her significantly scarier. Her red stat, “Halloween Spirit”, grows over time, specifically gaining 1 point passively at the start of Geist’s turn. Whenever she deals damage (either directly or through status), she also gains an equivalent amount of Halloween Spirit. Similarly, whenever she is damaged, half of the damage dealt is then added to her Halloween Spirit. When she reaches 31 Halloween Spirit, her energy reaches its max as she removes her mask and enters Trickster Spirit Form. While in this form, her movement is increased by 2, she gains a +3 on all rolls, and all of her actions gain different, incredibly potent buffs. Geist is able to maintain this form for 2 rounds before reverting to normal with 0 Halloween Spirit. Halloween Spirit carries over between combats. (Prof 35) Witching Hour - If Geist would go to 31 Halloween Spirit, she can choose to hold the moment and stay at 30 instead, in order to maximize the timing of her Trickster Spirit form!"
passive,Geist,Children of The Night,,0,"At the start of her turn, Geist may choose to activate this passive with a free action whistle. This calls in some ghostly children from the shadows, armed with eggs and toilet paper!Whenever Geist performs an attacking action, the ghosts also get to roll collectively to throw some TP and deal an additional 1 damage to the target, which adds to Geist’s passive. Rolls of 14+ apply Haunted as well. This only applies to one person per attack even if the attack hit multiple people. However, Geist has to keep paying them with candy, which costs her 2 stamina at the start of her turns"
ability,Geist,Jack-o'-Havoc,3,1,"Geist pulls out a jack-o’-lantern: a special one she carved herself! Its stem acts as a fuse, and the design carved into it can be whatever Geist wants. With a cartoonish wind-up, she tosses it somewhere up to 5 spaces away, and it explodes upon impact with either an object or the ground. The explosion hits the targeted space and all spaces adjacent to it, dealing 5 damage and inflicting a secondary effect based on the carving Geist chose. On rolls above a 13, this also inflicts the Haunted Status, dealing 1 ghost damage at the start of an afflicted unit’s next 1d3 turns. Trickster Spirit - Jack-o’-Havoc’s base range and damage are increased by 3, its explosion radius becomes 5x5, and it always inflicts the Haunted Status for 1d3 + 1 turns. (Prof 29) Bounce-o’-Rama - Jack-o’-Havoc’s bombs themselves are infused with mischievous energy, allowing them to bounce off the first thing they’re thrown on. This allows Geist, if she chooses, to double the range of her lob assuming she has something to bounce off of with a semi-reasonable trajectory to it (they can turn about 90 degrees). It also explodes on both its bounce and actual landing. However, if she does this then the radius of the explosive decreases by 2 sizes (so 3x3 goes to 1x1, and 5x5 goes to 3x3)."
ability,Geist,Trick or Treat,2!,1,"In the middle of whatever is happening, Geist pushes her finger into the air as a doorbell sound is heard. She then exclaims “Trick or Treat!” to a chosen target, while also stating the amount of stamina she would like from them as a treat. If the target gives them that amount of stamina, it is morphed into a physical candy that she or someone else can eat to heal for that much. If they refuse to give her the treat, she devilishly smiles as her mischief-making allows her to either immediately perform a basic attack against them or inflict a status of her choice upon them. Once per round. Trickster Spirit - Trick or Treat does not cost stamina to use."
ability,Geist,Curse of The Pumpkin Patch,3⛯,0,"After stomping on the ground a few times, a group of pumpkins and thorny pumpkin vines arise from the ground. Geist can choose for these to either appear in a 6 space line or in a 4x4 area around her, and any enemies that travel through the vines have their movement cut in half, and take 1 damage for each step they take while in them. If an enemy starts their turn in the vines, they also take 1 damage. Once per Combat. Trickster Spirit - The line variation of Curse of the Pumpkin Patch instead becomes a cross that reaches to the ends of the arena, and the area variation of the ability increases to 5x5 and summons a “Great Pumpkin” in its center that can deal 4 damage attacks by utilizing the vines."
ability,Geist,Shadows Stalk The Night,1!,0,"Once per round, Geist can seemingly pull and warp the shadows while lit by the jack-o-lantern flame that is Halloween! She can use this to solidify any shadow and control them to do some minor task, such as strike at an enemy (around 1-3 damage), tie someone down, or pull someone a few short spaces. Shadows can also do anything that what they’re cast from can do except for any kind of epithet powers, but they’re much weaker than the originals. You can only change one shadow at a time. Trickster Spirit - Shadows Stalk The Night has its damage increased to 3-6, and is more effective when combo-ing into or out of a move!"
ability,Geist,Throw The Shame Juice,2!,0,"Throw a potion bottle filled with fizz at anyone, casting Wild Magic upon them. Once per Round. Trickster Spirit - The fizz inside the bottle becomes highly volatile “Halloween Essence”. A jack-o-lantern face can be seen imposed on the liquid, a slight cackle can be heard, and the bottle itself vibrates. When thrown on a unit, the concoction explodes and creates a cloud of jack-o-lantern patterns that can act as an interrupt. Before or after the Wild Magic result is rolled, Geist can choose to change the result into “Happy Halloween!”, which may or may not do something depending on Geist’s roll and intent."
weapon,Googol,Transforming Tentacles,,0,"Googol slashes out with one of their tentacles, morphing it into a form of their choice in the process. Damage and range depends on the specific weapon Googol creates. (Prof 22) Gettin’ Stronger! - Transforming Tentacles deals +1 damage regardless of what form it takes."
talent,Googol,Evolve and Adapt,,0,"After long enough exposure to an environmental hazard, Googol will adapt and thus be unaffected by it. Extremely prolonged exposure may even allow Googol to gain positive effects from it. (Prof 42) Physical Alteration - Evolve and Adapt now applies to statuses and debuffs! Reminder, it still takes time to come into effect."
talent,Googol,Goopy Body,,0,"Projectiles just kind of get absorbed into Googol’s goopy mass when they get hit, halving the damage."
talent,Googol,Look at His Li’l Legs Go!,,0,"/+1 movement, regardless of the form Googol’s currently turned into."
passive,Googol,Master of Many Faces,,2,"At the start of Googol’s turn, they can choose to transform into one of the characters in their repertoire, inheriting their character sheet (excluding stamina and proficiency). Not only this, but they can also choose a second character at this time whose attributes can be applied to what Googol’s current form can do. Googol cannot maintain the same form for more than two turns. - Viktor Valentine - Timothy T.T. Tuesday Jr. - Saffron Judith Pemberton - Emrick Rallavar - Leon Neon - Retnue Throwdown - Beetlebob - Rosé Lee - Jester - Robin Rimmicks - Mr. Worldwide - Sunny Starburst - W (Camshake) - (Prof 36) Velletri Siward - (Prof 47) Kat Faedelcrane - Tesla Magnes - (Prof 77) Mistral “Misty” Willows - Donovan Bushida - Korima - Wendrow Wonderland - Aeron Noumi - Echo - Izuru Andromeda - Soph’et (Prof 44) Mental Reconstruction - Googol’s grown quite a bit! Well, in a way. When turning into a character, their mind is more resilient to the change, meaning that they subconsciously understand that they are Googol and not who they are turned into. As such, Googol can still use non-anytime abilities of his while turned into someone else. (Prof 60) Role Model Emulation - At the end of a session, Googol may choose either another character of yours or one of your allies and add that character to their transformation list! However, doing this costs 10 max stamina."
ability,Googol,Copycat Counter,2!,1,"When an attack is targeting Googol, they can counter with an exoskeleton-armored stomp using one of their appendages, which stops the attack in its tracks. They then follow up with their own version of the blocked attack with added elemental effect of either fire, electricity, ice, or shadow. Once per Round. (Prof 53) Multifarious Counter - In addition to the initial set of elements, you may choose to pick an element associated with one of the characters you can turn into for Copycat Counter!"
ability,Googol,Doppelganger Gang-Up,3,2,"Unleashing their Super Move, the surrounding area darkens as Googol unleashes a chain of successive attacks, taking the form of other entities while doing so. Each strike utilizes a pre-chosen character set, and Googol cannot use the same character twice in the same combo. If the first hit lands, the second is a guaranteed follow-up. If Googol wishes, they can continue the attack, but they must roll for each new addition to the combo, and this ability cannot be used again for the rest of combat."
ability,Googol,Optic Absolution,X,0,"Googol’s eye flashes before they launch a beam towards a chosen unit. This beam contains samples of Googol’s DNA, allowing it to take on characteristics of up to three characters. The effect and stamina cost of this ability depend on what characteristics are chosen. (Prof 81) Ultimate Rainbow - Optic Absolution no longer has a limit on how many characters Googol can use with it, although using a lot of them will obviously increase the stamina cost to exorbitant amounts. They can also split the laser into separate beams just like in their Ultimate Form, so long as the same character isn’t used in more than one beam!"
ability,Googol,Separation Theorem,1,0,"Googol separates a small amount of his mass, creating a Googolet that waddles around. Googol can see anything the little guy can see, and it can perform non-ability non-weapon standard actions. It inherits the passives that the main Googol gains from transformations (but cannot transform itself) and can of course bend and morph its body into any object for use by themselves or others. [RIDBI’S SHOWBOATING] - If Googol pays an extra stamina when using Separation Theorem, they can do a quirky little spin, making it be used as a Bonus Action as the Googolet flips off of them."
ability,Googol,Reflexive Reform,2!,1,"Googol quickly forms into a new shape. This can be into an object to be used in an action, morphing around incoming attacks, or changing what form he’s in with his passive at anytime speed! Once per Round."
ability,Googol,Double Helix,3,0,"Waving their gooey hands together, a helix pattern outstretches from Googol in a 3x7 area. Picking two of their characters from their passive, Googol can effectively create a line attack in this area so long as it has the combined properties of both characters. In addition, for each hit target he may pay 1 additional stamina to apply a debuff (or potentially buff) based on the character combo, as their genetics are temporarily spliced."
ability,Googol,Assist Automata,2!,2,"Whenever an ally successfully lands an attack, you may use this ability to quickly shift into another form as your passive says, perform an action as them to follow them up, and then quickly switch back. You cannot turn into your current form with this, unless Complete Imprint is active. Your action must be offensive in nature against one of the hit targets of the move you’re following up. You must roll for and pay costs for your follow up separately from this. Once per Round."
weapon,Lavenza,Holo-Caster,,0,"Regardless of the robot she’s currently controlling, Lavenza’s made sure to build a particular, small gun within them capable of firing “Holo-Casters”. These are very small, magnetic discs that can attach to most surfaces. Once attached it cannot only produce a hologram of Lavenza for whatever purpose that may serve, but it also also allows Lavenza to attempt to hack into a technological device given that it is attached to said device."
weapon,Lavenza,A Gun,,0,"After a particular encounter, Lavenza has become quite a bit more paranoid and has bought a gun. This gun has around 20 range and deals variable damage depending on what body part she is aiming at. This usually doesn’t mean much because she’s behind her computer screen. However, she’s outfitted her teleporter to be able to teleport her bullets. While the bullet is being teleported, its velocity and deadliness is drastically decreased, turning it into a 6 range 4 damage Basic Attack."
talent,Lavenza,Hackerwoman,,0,Lavenza has an advantage when attempting to hack/manipulate relatively simple technology. A +3 for more advanced technology.
passive,Lavenza,Patch Notes,,0,"As a main action on her turn, Lavenza can pull up her laptop and pump out some new “balance changes'' for her current robot. These changes take the form of slight changes to her robot’s kit, either via numbers or added effects, or extra rules/conditions added into a robot’s coding when it is put into A.I. Mode. Depending on the severity of the changes, Lavenza pays variable stamina cost. Any given “Build” of a robot can have up to 6 changes from base, and at the start of combat, Lavenza can choose to either utilize a previously completed build or to continue adjusting an incomplete build during the combat. She cannot change the build she is using mid combat, but she can revert previously made changes on a build to free up her augment slots. At the end of a session, Lavenza can choose one build to bring to her next session."
ability,Lavenza,Mini-Gadgets,X,0,"As an inventor, Lavenza always has a wealth of contraptions at her disposal. Of course, she has also outfitted her robots with a teleportation device that allows her to send them these contraptions on the fly. Stamina cost and usage of the contraption depends on what exactly it is, and the device typically has to be on the smaller side. Using this ability takes both Lavenza’s Main Action and her robot’s Movement Action. (Prof 15) U-Turn - Whirlagigas can now send things to Lavenza if Lavenza would so desire with no extra stamina cost using Mini-Gadgets. This allows Lavenza to use items found in the combat if she so desires to make more unique and effective gadgets."
ability,Lavenza,Max Difficulty CPU,3,0,"When Lavenza is feeling particularly lazy, or she wants to see how her coding is shaping up, she puts her current robot into its autopilot “A.I. Mode”. When doing so, she gives the robot a singular command, prompting it to do nothing but that until the goal is achieved. When in this mode, the robot will destroy absolutely everything via the use of whatever it has in its kit, which gains a +2 in damage, or simple grab-n-throws on units and objects in its path. The GM controls all of the robot’s turns (including rolling for the robot unless they’d rather Lavenza’s Player do so), while a miniature drone with a Holo-Caster is deposited at the site of activation. This drone has 5 movement, 10 stamina, and allows Lavenza to use Mini-Gadgets (using only its main action) from it. Considering its size, however, the drone cannot operate non-automatic gadgets on its own. If the drone is destroyed, Lavenza cannot do anything until the assigned goal is either completed or cancelled via use of a full turn. Maintaining A.I. Mode has a 1 stamina upkeep cost on the robot. The initial activation of this ability requires use of Lavenza’s and her robot’s main action, unless Lavenza rolls a 15+, which frees up her robot’s main action. (Prof 24) My A.I. Can Produce Mind Boggling Effects - While giving the A.I. a task to do, Lavenza can give a new passive/talent/ability based on a CPU from one of the many video games that she has played. This Passive/Talent/Ability can only be used by a robot while in the Max Difficulty CPU state."
ability,Lavenza,Mini-BAMFs,X,0,"Lavenza has been sending one of her most… competent inventions to DBA recently. That invention being B.A.M.F. the friendly bomb! Lavenza, not really knowing the ultimate fruit of her endeavors, wants to see B.A.M.F. himself in action. Thus, Lavenza can send over X mini-B.A.M.F.s (Max of 5). Each having a stamina point for every 5 stamina points that B.A.M.F. has. However, since there are so many mini-B.A.M.F.s, that's too many games of minesweeper to be played by one person alone. Lavenza’s Player can choose to give off the other games of minesweeper to other people. The catch is though, Lavenza's Player has to be playing for at least one of the mini-B.A.M.F.s. Normally, B.A.M.F. just gets a buff if a game is completed, however, Mini-B.A.M.F.S. get to take their main action if a game of minesweeper is completed by the player that took said Mini-B.A.M.F.. If a Mini-B.A.M.F. would crit, Proficiency goes into the actual B.A.M.F.!"
weapon,Whirlagigas,Heavy Smash,,1,"Whirlagigas launches a devastating punch at a chosen target, utilizing its size to dominate space. However, its large amount of startup causes it to have a -3 to its rolls. However, this comes with the plus of anytimes needing to roll at least 3 higher than Whirlagigas’s natural roll in order to stop this attack. 7 damage 2 range."

talent,Whirlagigas,Wall Bounce,,0,"When Whirlagigas throws/knocks a unit into a wall or similar surface, if Lavenza desires, they bounce off of said wall/surface with great force. This allows the first follow-up attack performed on said unit during this turn to roll with advantage. If a unit can reasonably manage to attack this unit after the Wall Bounce and the turn the Wall Bounce occurred and before that unit would naturally fall to the ground, they receive the advantage. A Wall Bounce can only occur Once per Round."
talent,Whirlagigas,Armor Junkie,,0,"If Whirlagigas ever gains/receives DR (not from its own kit), the first hit it takes while it has said DR automatically grants Whirlagigas a charge of its Passive."
passive,Whirlagigas,Omni-Armor,,1,"Whirlagigas is incredibly sturdy and bulky, allowing it to use its overwhelming strength to power through the toughest of obstacles. No amount of force or damage can stop Whirlagigas while it performs an action, as it simply brute forces its way through to continue. Whenever it does so, the Kinetic Force of the damage is absorbed into Whirlagigas, being stored in one of the three generators on its back. Along with this, Once per Round, Whirlagigas may attempt to armor through an attack targeting it. Doing so may reduce the damage slightly, but primarily, it negates all knockback and prevents Whirlagigas from being knocked prone while also allowing it to store the Kinetic Force. While Whirlagigas has Kinetic Force stored, it may pay variable amounts of stamina along with expending said instance of Kinetic Force to perform one of multiple options: - By paying 1 stamina as an anytime, Whirlagigas may attempt to cause its entire body to vibrate, producing a shockwave to stop and/or negate the damage from an incoming attack.  - By paying 3 stamina as a Bonus Action on its turn, Whirlagigas can “cancel” out of an action it is performing, rolling and moving up to 2 spaces if Lavenza desires. After doing so, it can perform one from this set of actions (that may receive some form of damage proration depending on the situation/length of a given action chain Whirlagigas is in the middle of): - Hardcore Headbutt - Whirlagigas grasps onto an adjacent unit before slamming its head into them with great force. This deals 6-7 damage that removes DR on a unit that it hits while knocking them prone. - Lethal Lariat - Whirlagigas extends its arms outward, spinning like a top to hit all units adjacent to it for 5 damage. This attack inflicts up to 3 spaces of knockback on hit units, and the whirlwind of force Whirlagigas produces creates a small forcefield around it that gives it 1 DR for the next attack it is hit by. - Deadly Drag - Whirlagigas grabs an adjacent unit before slamming them into the ground and dragging them across it up to 3 spaces away from Whirlagigas’s current location. This deals 6 damage to the grabbed unit, and 2-3 to all enemies Whirlagigas passes through. At the end of this attack, the initial target is thrown into the air."
ability,Whirlagigas,Hell Cyclone,3,0,"Whirring to life in an instant, Whirlagigas reaches out and grabs an adjacent unit, placing them in a grapple. From here, Whirlagigas either performs some kind of massively showy suplex maneuver on them, or begins wildly slamming them into the ground and/or nearby objects. This typically deals around 8-10 damage on a target, but this may change depending on the type of technique that is utilized.  Regardless of this, Whirlagigas can choose to end this attack with a vicious hammer toss, spinning rapidly before throwing its target up to 6 spaces away. This turns them into a projectile, causing them to deal 1-4 damage to units they pass through."
ability,Whirlagigas,Shoulder Check,1+X!,1,"Once per Round. With surprising speed and great force, Whirlagigas dashes forward up to its movement speed while performing a deadly shoulder bash. This deals 2-4 damage, and interrupts the actions of those Whirlagigas collides with during the attack. However, upon the initial activation of the ability, Whirlagigas can elect to hold its charge, causing them to wait until a specified turn (any point within said turn) to dash. For each full turn that it is held, the attack gains specific additional properties, and Whirlagigas must pay an additional point of stamina. This can be held up to 4 turns, having to be released by the end of the fourth turn, and Whirlagigas can choose to cancel the charge at any point during it, moving a space in any direction while doing so. 1 Turn Charge - This attack knocks hit units prone. +1 damage. 2 Turn Charge - This attack causes a hit unit to spin-out before being knocked prone, giving this attack up to 6 spaces of knockback (Lavenza may decide how far she wants to send someone). Along with this, the next instance of damage they receive is increased by 1. +2 damage. 3 Turn Charge - This attack causes a hit unit to go flying into the air, knocking them up to 6 spaces in any direction (Lavenza may decide how far she wants to send someone), before they fall back to the ground prone. This allows Whirlagigas, to, if Lavenza wants, move up to a hit unit to follow-up with a main action, although at reduced effectiveness. +3 damage. (Prof 13) Rocket Cancel - While/after performing Shoulder Check, Whirlagigas can spend 1 stamina to have the jet engines built into its back and/or limbs activate, causing it to move half of its movement speed in any direction. This dash doesn’t deal damage inherently, but may lead to extra damage depending on circumstance."
ability,Whirlagigas,Terror Twister,3,0,"Whirlagigas’s upper body begins spinning rapidly, to the point that a mini-twister begins forming around them. Whirlagigas can move up to 2 spaces, dealing 4 damage to any units it is/becomes adjacent to while also knocking them back slightly. Along with this, green, whirling winds begin spiraling around hit units, inflicting them with the “Twisted” status. Units afflicted with Twisted must use 2 movement to move a single space away from Whirlagigas and, if they have not used their Movement Action to move on their turns, they are dragged 2-3 spaces closer to Whirlagigas. If a unit is dragged closer to Whirlagigas in this way while already adjacent to it, they take 1 damage. If a unit afflicted with Twisted suffers decent knockback that forces them away from Whirlagigas, they may take additional damage as wind force tears at them"

passive,Melograno,Punchin' In The Numbers,,2,"At the start of combat, Melograno can...wait, is that a phone ringing? Yes, in fact it’s Melograno’s! As he checks to see the number that’s calling him, he rolls 10 d10s to determine each digit. With this now created phone number, Melograno is able to take any one of the digits and add it to or subtract it from a chosen numerical value or roll as a once per round anytime action. Any zeroes rolled add one extra stamina to Melograno’s maximum for the combat. (Prof 20) Area Code - Since old phone plans need you to type a 1 before the area code and number, you get a 1 from your passive in addition to the 10 other numbers that are added. (Prof 39) Chain Phone Calls - Whenever Melograno successfully lands a basic attack, uses Yellow Pages, or BRRRRRING RING RING RING, Melograno gets to roll another d10 for Punchng In The Numbers. (Prof 60) Punchin’ in the Letters - An upgrade to Punching In The Numbers. Melograno’s flip phone has been upgraded into one of those keyboard phones! Whenever Melograno rolls a 1d10 for his passive, Melograno may designate any number of those dice to be for letter types instead of numbers. He rolls a 1d26 for each one he does so to, corresponding to a letter in the English alphabet. Taking up the same “once per round” anytime slots as when you apply numbers, Melograno can apply these letters to objects or properties of items to alter their effects! He can apply as many letters as he has at once in a single anytime use as well, to modify something on a greater scale if he has the resources for it. Letters are potentially very powerful but are more specialized in their use than numbers, so choose wisely! (Prof 81) Address Book - Whenever Melograno’s passive triggers at the start of combat for the first time this session, if he doesn’t like his number/letter distribution, he can choose to save his first list of 10 and instead roll a second set. The “stored” set can then be used to replace any other set you roll for the rest of the session. You can only have one stored set at a time.(Prof 91) Family Plan - 0s rolled by Punchin' in the Numbers grant +1 overheal stamina to each of his allies as well as himself."

ability,Melograno,Yellow Pages,2,1,"Aw, Melograno knew he knew the number for this place at some point, but it looks like he forgot it. Fortunately, he has a phone book that he can use to relocate it! By stating who or what he’s calling, he can summon an object related to them so long as he gives context/reason as to why he could get that from them. [ROBIN] Oz’s Essence: Ancient Tome of Knowledge - Instead of the usual phone book, Melograno can pay 1 additional stamina and manifest a book containing an account of history and knowledge from across the ages. This allows Melograno to pull from specific historical events and figures when using Yellow Pages. This can even allow him to summon ghostly reconstructions of these figures to perform an action before dissipating."
ability,Melograno,Number Neighbor,2,1,"Spends Melograno’s Main Action and Movement. He moves forward like a normal movement action, but he suddenly leaves behind an untransformed clone of himself.

ability,Melograno,Land Line,1!,1,"Melograno uses a cellphone, but that doesn’t mean he can’t get some phone wires using his epithet! With this, Melograno quickly conjures up a spiral cord with which to lasso something or tie up someone.

ability,Melograno,Seven Days,3⛯,0,"Once per Combat Melograno, as if like clockwork, gets a call from a mysterious person or thing. Maybe it’s a cranky family member, usually it’s demons or ghosts or doctors or some other cursed shit. This surprise call causes their power to unleash in a 5 range forwards 3 range diameter cone in front of Melograno, as their pure rage flies through the phone speakers loud enough for it to be awkwardly listenable by passersby even without speaker mode. This applies a single effect related to the person calling on everyone within the area, before Melograno reblocks their number. Too bad his phone is too old to block numbers. If this ability is the target of Instant Transmission, it becomes a twice per combat."
ability,Melograno,Linked With Multiple Devices,3,2,"Melograno transmits an ethereal cord of data from his phone over to another ally within his line of sight. Once the connection has been established, so long as they’re both on the same plane of existence, they are aware of each other’s locations and, more importantly, they gain access to each other’s abilities. This tether has no limit to how long it can last, but only one tether can exist at a time.

All categorized so that it’s quick to get to what you need.When used as an ability, a pink aura erupts from a target within 10 spaces of Melograno, which remains wavering and shining until combat ends or Melograno cuts the connection. For as long as this is active, Melograno can use a once per round anytime to instantly teleport the affected unit to a space adjacent to him, allowing them to completely avoid the negative effects of something they were targeted by. Even if, for example, this is used to have the affected unit dodge an AoE that they would still be hit by even after teleporting, they still avoid the effects, simply remaining in teleport stasis for just long enough to remain safe. While this ability is active, Melograno cannot use any other App Abilities, and also loses access to Instant Transmission. In the case of Number Neighbor Clones, none of them can use the App Abilities, but only the one who activated Emergency Hotline loses access to Instant Transmission."
weapon,Roko,Rock Hard Pummel,,0,"Roko coats chosen parts of her body in stone before slamming into an enemy unit. Upon making contact with another surface, Roko can choose for the stone to extend from her body onto said surface, which may have various effects. On rolls of 16+, this inflicts 1d3 stacks of Petrify. 5 damage 1 range. (Prof 21) Hard Coating - +1 Damage (5 to 6)."
weapon,Roko,Bringer,,1,"Roko’s Golden Artifact, a weapon granted to her via her connection to her father. To activate Bringer, along with the mantra typically stated with Golden Artifacts, Roko must also either plant or crush a small golden seed that she manifests. Depending on what she does, the form Bringer takes changes. This initial activation can be used as Movement Action, and is what uses the above stats, as Roko can spit the seed as a projectile which nests itself in a unit or object of Roko’s choice. 1 damage 6 range. - Bringer - Cultivation (X Damage, X Range) - This is the form Bringer takes if Roko plants the seed within something. As she does, a storm of vines and flowers erupt from the seed, which can wrap and move however Roko wishes. If Roko targets an empty space, a 3x3, golden tree grows instead (which Roko can also manipulate). Along with this, Roko manifests an illustrious, golden weapon based on whatever the seed is growing in. This determines its stats and other abilities it can (and usually does) have. - Bringer - Order (5 Damage, 3 Range) - If Roko crushes the seed herself, from it, a golden, dual-bladed scythe with shimmering flowers blooming throughout the handle manifests, radiating life-like energy. It has Cleave inherently, and can be thrown past its melee range, taking up 2x2 area but losing 1 damage for each extra space traveled. When swung, Bringer causes plantlife to grow on spaces that it travels across, which Roko can manipulate and move freely. Along with this, when a unit is either standing on/in or is covered in this plantlife, Roko gains minor lifesteal (up to half damage max) when attacking them."
talent,Roko,Xanthic Eyes,,0,"At the start of combat, Roko attunes her epithet to a single enemy. Secretly list three different actions that enemy can perform. These actions cannot be something that takes only game mechanics into account, such as “use an anytime” or “use a once per combat”. Instead, they should be more specific, such as “hit Unit A with your sword” or “breathe fire on multiple targets”. Whenever the enemy takes one of those actions for the first time, that action gains a plus (value of which said enemy can choose) to their roll(s) and they take damage equal to that roll buff. Once they've done all three listed actions, they gain Petrify Stacks equal to 1/3rd their max stamina rounded up."
passive,Roko,Den Hazard,,1,"On Roko’s turns, she has up to three “Hazard Actions” that she can use to place specific areas on the field. The size of this area is a “X”x”X”, with “X” being equal to the amount of stamina she spends to create the area. The cap she can spend on a Hazard Action is 5 stamina. Upon creating a “Hazard Area”, a floating, yellow eye peers down onto it, crackling as it stays afloat. Whenever an enemy enters a Hazard Area, Roko can choose to activate the area, which does 1 of 2 things: She can choose to inflict stacks of Petrify equal to “X” + 1 onto the enemy. This does not cost stamina, nor does it remove the area. She can choose to expend the area, dealing damage equal to “X” + 1 and temporarily turning the enemy to stone. At this point, Roko can choose to leave them be, which negates their next movement action as they revert to normal, or, if she’s adjacent to the enemy or area, she can immediately follow-up with an extra action. This extra action is typically reduced in power. Expending the area costs 1 stamina, and the area dissipates regardless of whether Roko succeeds or not. An enemy only counts as “entering” a Hazard Area the first time they do within the span of 3 turns. (Prof 24) Radiation Warning - When Roko creates a Hazard Area, the dimensions of it can be whatever she wants, and X is now equal to the total number of spaces the area takes up multiplied by itself. For example, spending 1 Stamina gives her 1x1=1 space. 5 Stamina equals 5x5=25 total spaces. The areas do not have to be connected to each other. The spaces do not have to be connected to each other and can overlap. The cap she can spend on Hazard Areas is now increased from 3 to 5 Stamina."
passive,Roko,Trophy Unlocked,,1,"At the start of one combat per session, Roko can spend 5 Stamina to manifest a statuette copy of either one of the party members, or of someone very close to her whose form she’d had time to memorize. Good friends, family members, or significant others would be examples. This statuette has 25 Stamina and 2 DR against physical damage (minimum of 1 damage taken). If this statue is broken, the real version of that character is summoned to the statue’s location and can immediately take a Main Action that cannot combo or chain. This action rolls with advantage if used as a dual-tech with Roko or one of her allies. Roko can also give the statuette very small, minor changes that last for the duration of the Main Action. The statue can also be in any position she wants, and wearing whatever clothes she wants, so Roko can just create clothing now. Note that the summoned target, if summoned from outside the main party, is not dismissed after the action is taken, but they are heavily exhausted after being summoned in this manner, and after taking the Main Action cannot further participate in combat until after this session. She cannot summon targets who are in plot prison."
passive,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Animal Hybrid: Crimson Demon,,0,"This fruit is one of a handful that grants their user the ability to completely or partially turn into an animal/different species which grants a few benefits. It requires a Movement Action to go up or down a level. Hybrid - Roko’s body becomes cambian in nature, her skin turning a pinkish red and horns sprouting from your body. This gives her resistance to fire damage. Full - Roko’s body fully becomes a demon of the Crimson Hell. She becomes immune to fire damage, and fire attacks of this fruit now treat non-demonic fire immunity as a resistance and non-demonic fire resistance as if it weren’t there. She also sprouts wings and gains a fly speed. However, in return, she is now vulnerable to holy damage. VIP Access - Roko can transform into Hybrid Form at the start of combat if she desires."
passive,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Blood Cast,,1,"Roko may make an adjacent unit pay up to 3 stamina of any of her ability stamina costs, assuming the unit has blood."
ability,Roko,Stone Cold,X,0,"After firming her stance for a moment, Roko coats her entire body in stone. Once this has been done, she lashes out at an adjacent target, sending an immense amount of force into them. This deals variable damage depending on stamina spent, and the stamina spent also equates to how much knockback + 1 the blow will inflict on the target. Roko can also funnel any remaining movement she has into the knockback of the attack at a 1 to 1 ratio, which does not affect damage. (Prof 30) Rock Solid - If the roll for ‘Stone Cold’ fails, Roko still manages to reinforce her body according to the Stamina she spent, but does not manage to land an attack using it on this turn. However, on a future turn, ‘Stone Cold’ can be used as a Bonus Action for which she must pay 2 Stamina if she uses the same damage value she would have had with the previous use. In addition, if she uses Stone Cold and the roll succeeds, she can still choose to have the attack not go off immediately and use the same Bonus Action rule described above, and until she uses Stone Cold again, the damage and knockback of ‘Rock Hard Pummel’ is increased by X divided by 2, rounded down. This lasts for 2 rounds at most and cannot be done twice in the same combat."
ability,Roko,Statuette Silencer,2!,1,"Roko, a gleam in her eyes, quickly dodges out of the way of an incoming attack to a space within 4 of her current location. Where she once stood is a statue of the attacker in a pose of Roko’s choice. If someone (other than Roko) makes contact with the statue, the part of their body that touched it becomes stuck in stone, restricting them in some way. A statue made with this ability lasts for one whole round. If an enemy makes contact with a statue after the turn it was created, they gain Petrify Stacks equal to however much damage they took with a minimum of 1. Once per Round. (Prof 35) Silenced - Statuette Silencer now inflicts Petrify Stacks equal to the damage it deals even if it’s touched the same turn it’s created, and Roko can now dodge up to 4 (increased from 2) spaces away"
ability,Roko,Eye of The Beholder,X,0,"Roko takes something she can see, and then constructs a stone copy of it that may differ in size to the original. If necessary to lift an object, she can enhance her physical strength by turning parts of her body to stone. If multiple objects are connected to each other, she can include any of them in the replica, but of course with higher stamina costs present. If this is used on an enemy, she can spend 1 additional stamina to inflict that many Petrify Stacks -1 onto a target."
ability,Roko,Serpentine Soldiers,3,1,"Sound the trumpets, for the angels of death approach. Roko focuses her power and creates two stone constructs within 3 spaces of her, each with the appearance of an eyeless stone serpent with wide, feathered wings. Each serpent has 10 Stamina and 2 DR against physical damage (minimum of 1 damage taken). By default, these serpents can’t move or act, but when they are summoned, Roko can choose enemies on the battlefield for each serpent to ‘attune’ to. Multiple serpents can attune to the same enemy. If an enemy that a serpent is attuned to is defeated, that serpent crumbles to dust. Each time an attuned enemy takes an action that is not directed specifically at a serpent they are attuned to, including moving in directions that are not directly towards the serpent, then it can move X spaces closer to them, where X equals 2 + half of the attuned target’s current Petrify stacks (rounded down), with X having a maximum of 6. The serpents can fly if necessary. If an enemy attempts to take an action that is not directed at an attuned serpent while it is adjacent to them, or attempt to move away from it, the serpent can roll with advantage to attack them, dealing 5 damage and inflicting 1d4+1 Petrify stacks. If Roko uses this ability again while serpents are still alive, the old ones are destroyed. Twice per Combat."
ability,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Devil Flame,1,0,"Roko creates demonic flame in her hands. This ability’s potency changes depending on her form: Base - This ability deals 3-5 fire damage to an adjacent unit, and can be used as a Bonus Action. Hybrid - This ability deals 5-6 fire damage at 3 range, and can be used as a Bonus Action. Full - This ability deals 6-8 fire damage in a 3x5 area adjacent to Roko and costs +1 stamina. VIP Access - +2 damage to all of Devil Flame’s variations. This is already accounted for in the ability text."
ability,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Arch Fiend,3,0,"Hybrid and Full Form only. Roko summons 2d4! imps. They are weak-willed and will naturally follow her command, unless some arch devil of a higher rank than her is present (for example a member of the royal family)."
weapon,Sho,MEGA COOL MARTIAL ARTS ATTACK,,0,"Sho’s master has shown him enough martial arts movies to make sure that he knows how to do this right. 2 damage 1 range. (Prof 13) Barrage of Blows - Sho may willingly split up the amount of attacks using his MEGA COOL MARTIAL ARTS ATTACK he will make on his turn up to three, evenly dividing the damage by the amount of attacks he chooses to make. This cannot be used in Combination with Combo Time. (Prof 31) Striking Afterimage Technique - As long as Sho is splitting it up with ""Barrage of Blows"", he can continue moving after making a basic attack and then attack again after repositioning."
weapon,Sho,Sword Lessons - Spirit Sword,,0,"7 damage 1 range. Having done some training with Mr. Donovan, Sho has focused and refined the energy constructs he can make with Tic-Tac-Toe to Toe so that he can create a sword of pure energy whenever he would need it! As a Free Action, Sho can manifest this sword for 2 Stamina or 1 Stack (his choice), and he must pay 1 Upkeep if he keeps it manifested. It acts as a Basic Attack which ignores DR and adds half of Sho’s Stacks to damage. If Sho were to obtain a real sword, he can use this to instead enhance the sword, or choose to effectively dual-wield. Rolling a natural 20 with this Basic Attack grants Proficiency."
talent,Sho,Limit Break,,0,"Upon being put to half or less max stamina, Sho surpasses his current capacity. This gives him one action to take immediately and increases his passive charge interval to 2. With Limit Break active, Sho’s passive now procs when he doesn’t take a movement action, and he can double move to charge twice in one turn. (Prof 41) Limiter Removal - The first time Sho would trigger Limit Break in a session, he can choose to activate this instead.He still gets his immediate main action, but the other effects are instead: for the remainder of the session, Sho gains 1d2 charges whenever he would gain just 1 charge. Using this (obviously) causes him to be incapable of using Limit Break for the remainder of the session."
talent,Sho,Bento Box,,0,"As a child, Sho needs a lot of calories to ensure he grows healthy and strong, so he always makes sure his guardians pack him a lunchbox (or sixteen) before he goes out for the day. Once per Combat he may pull out one such box of food and consume its contents as a free action to heal for 4 stamina and recover from one status effect of his choice."
passive,Sho,Raising Tension,,0,"It takes a while for Sho’s epithet to reach peak operative capacity; the longer combat is the more effective he becomes. Every round he doesn’t take a Main Action, his movement speed and basic attack damage are increased by one. (Prof 21) Raising Tension - Every third time Sho gains a charge through his passive, Sho gets a stacking +1 to rolls on his basic attack for the rest of combat."
passive,Sho,I'm A Gum-Gum Human!,,1,"Sho’s entire body has properties identical to rubber! The exact depths of what that means will be explored later as he gets more used to it, develops new techniques, and/or takes more inspiration from the character who inspired the idea to do this to himself in the first place. But in any case, what matters for now is that Sho is highly resistant to bludgeoning force and electrical currents, having a flat 20 Physical DR against both. This effectively makes him immune to fall damage and many other similar things. Another important note is that it means he can stretch his body now! Sho’s melee reach is extended to 3 spaces as part of any action, but may be extended to 5 if he spends 1 Stamina on the action. This also applies to any ability that requires his arms or legs/physical body acting to accomplish."
ability,Sho,KaioKenshiro,1,0,"A form change where Sho increases his muscle mass dramatically in a short period of time without proper build up. This increases his passive counter by 4, with an upkeep of 1 stamina at the start of Sho’s turns. When he drops upkeep, his stacks are reduced by 2, along with the 4 temp stacks being removed."
ability,Sho,Lend Me Your Energy ,0!,1,"Whenever Sho would be damaged by an opponent, he can take on some of the power they used to hurt him, increasing his stacks by 1d3 and lowering the damage by that much (to a minimum of one). Once per Round. (Prof 25) Take My Energy! - Sho may use Lend Me Your Energy as a separate usage per round counter to reduce his power and heal another target of his choice with the d3."
ability,Sho,Combo Time,4⛯,1,"It’s time for the multiple hit chain that will knock out the big enemy. Roll 1dstack size+1 and start a combo attack where Sho rolls to hit an adjacent unit, knocks them two squares in a chosen direction, then follows up with another roll to hit. This continues until he misses or reaches the number of hits he rolled as maximum. Once per Combat."
ability,Sho,Tic-Tac-Toe to Toe,3,0,"Sho has realized he needs to diversify his skillset and think about some next level strategies and has thusly developed this technique which allows him to take his energy and form it into an effect based on which ‘shape’ he turns it into. - Xs - Sho focuses the energy in his body around his arms, forming serrated blades and then crosses them before making a chopping motion, creating an X marked cross-slash in the target. This attack does Sho’s basic attack damage and inflicts a bleed stack. Due to the cutting nature of this attack, he may ignore half of any DR a character has when using this. - Os - Forming it into a small sphere, Sho’s energy becomes a volatile projectile that can be fired up to 8 spaces for half of his basic attack damage, rounding down."
ability,Sho,Clashing Wills,2!,1,"Sho loves to fight people but the problem is that in most times that someone is fighting it is due to a clash in ideals and goals, with combat being the only way to determine whose philosophies are those worth making it through in the end. At least that's what he's gathered, he doesn't have a lot of ideals yet but it's what the bad guys always drone on about. Anyway, fighting with ideals is really cool! If Sho's attack would be countered with an anytime action, or if for whatever reason Sho and an enemy are attacking simultaneously, Sho can attempt to initiate an escalation. If the roll for the actions that allow him to use this are the same number, this happens without an activation roll. If the escalation rolls are within 1 of each other, they still escalate. For each escalation, the effective result of the action is strengthened starting at normal then 1.5, then doubled, then tripled, then quintupled as the max level effect, with the loser's being negated entirely. If Sho or the other affected target win the clash, they can choose to continue the escalation to increase the modifier this ability causes, and their next roll in the escalation gains a +2 roll buff. Once per Round."
ability,Sho,I’ll Fight With Both Hands Tied Behind My Back!,X,0,"Sho likes making sure that a fight that he’s in has proper stakes and challenges to overcome, otherwise what’s the point? He may choose to add any condition to any part of his current sheet and assign a stamina value to it. The Stronger the condition and more stamina spent the stronger it becomes while following your current guidelines. If you break a rule for whatever reason, regardless of your intent, you take double the spent stamina as irreducible damage. You can only have one Restriction active at a time. Bonus Action."
ability,Sho,Getsuga Ten-Sho,5⛯,0,"“Mr. Donovan’s sword Hades is really really cool! It can make these like really dangerous black flames n’ stuff! It might not be as cool since I don't have a weird demon dragon thingie stored inside me (I don’t think I do anyways), but I can make fire like it can if I try hard enough!”. Sho focuses an incredible amount of energy into his sword and then performs a massive energy slash with it. This affects a 3x6 area for his sword’s current damage and coats the area in black flames constructed from aura. This does not apply a burn status like Mr. Donovan’s technique, but the fires do stay within the targeted area. The terrain deals 3 irreducible damage for each space someone would move through it, and also at the start of their turns if a unit is in the area. Can only be used if Sho has his Spirit Sword manifested. Once per Combat."
ability,Sho,Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack,XX,1,"By focusing his usual rather volatile energy, Sho can exhale X amount of pseudo-clones of himself made of raw energy. As soon as they would make contact with anything, they detonate for 2d2 irreducible damage. These clones only have a Move Action, and have no Passives, Talents, or Abilities. However, their movement is equal to the movement speed Sho had when creating them. Half rounding down (minimum one) of these clones are allowed to take a move action upon being created. Recharge 5-6."
ability,Sho,Gum-Gum Fireworks,4,0,"Sho leaps into the air and wraps himself into a ball before sending out a bunch of punches and kicks in rapid succession. This deals his basic attack damage to everyone within a 10 foot radius of himself horizontally. This series of attacks is omnidirectional, meaning things such as a dodge will not work unless a unit fully gets out of the attack's range. Recharge 5-6."
weapon,Shotel,Execution Knife,,0,A small serrated knife used with great precision. It can be hidden without effort. 2 damage 1 range.
weapon,Shotel,King’s Club Katana,,0,"A katana obtained from within the armory of a fight club in Fight City. Nothing special in terms of craftsmanship, but effective enough to cut someone down. A tool is as effective as its wielder. 5 damage 1 range."
talent,Shotel,Two As One,,0,"Whenever Shotel attacks, Orthrus can take an immediate follow up action so long as the action affects the same target. If given to Orthrus, Shotel gets the follow up on Orthrus instead."
talent,Shotel,Putrid Sustain,,0,"Upon being knocked out, Shotel can continue to act even while unconscious until the end of her next turn. Be careful, as you can still die when going this far."
passive,Shotel,Biomantic Symbiote: Orthrus,,0,"Shotel has bound herself to a pact with a Peregrine Beast! Peregrine Beasts are special symbiotes which can form a lifelong connection with a person to grant them incredible powers! With Orthrus, you may pay any amount of max stamina and movement speed. If you do, Orthrus will morph itself into its own physical form, using Shotel’s very own flesh and organs to separate as a secondary creature. This does not require a roll, and you can do this multiple times to have multiple instances of Orthrus out. Orthrus has the same max stamina and movement speed that was paid to create it. You may also sacrifice any number of abilities, talents, or upgrades to also grant them to Orthrus, although doing so allows you to alter one part of its functionality for each thing. Orthrus isn’t considered a “summon” and is thus not susceptible to effects that target mooks or summons specifically. Regardless of what is given to it, Orthrus always has a basic attack where half its body morphs into a maw which deals 6 damage at melee range, or damage equal to a third of the stamina it’s missing from its max rounded down if that is more. Orthrus’s only weakness is that despite its offensive power, the terms of the pact mean that it can never knock out or take a life itself. The final blow must be done by Shotel herself, without using Orthrus’s powers. In addition, if Shotel is knocked out then Orthrus becomes dormant until she is resuscitated. All spent mechanics are returned to Shotel at the end of combat."
passive,Shotel,Head Hunter,,0,"Whenever Shotel lands the finishing blow on an enemy, she gains +1 max stamina. This is capped at +3 in a combat."
passive,Beri Beri No Mi,Bouncing Balls,,0,"Whenever Shotel would be exposed to bludgeoning damage, her body can split into multiple orbs reflexively to defend itself. This gives her a passive 5 DR against bludgeoning damage. If for whatever reason her body cannot split apart, this does not apply."
ability,Shotel,Divide Huntress,3,0,"Shotel runs forward as the top half of her body morphs into a beast-like maw. She travels in one direction up to her movement speed, passing through enemies along the way. Each enemy passed through takes 5 damage. If used by Orthrus, it may immediately take another action that isn’t Divide Huntress."
ability,Shotel,Spinal Tap,3!,1,"Shotel directly shocks either her own physical form or that of an adjacent organic creature. This causes a biomantic mutation to appear, granting a buff or debuff based on how their physicality is altered. This ability can only be used on enemies if they just failed an attack on Shotel. Alternatively, if this is used by Orthrus it can only be used on himself, but allows him to alter how any of his abilities function to a decent degree for the rest of combat. Once per Round."
ability,Shotel,Polyp Point,2,0,"Shotel rips off a part of her body and throws it up to 5 spaces away. If this makes direct contact, the projectile turns into boiling blood which deals 4 damage. If placed on the ground, the mass becomes a small filament on the ground. Once an enemy passes over it, the filament immediately extends into a 20 foot tall bone spear, which deals 7 damage and sticks the hit target in place so long as they’re a 2x2 or smaller. If used by Orthrus, he may perform this ability twice in one action, paying costs for both."
ability,Shotel,Blood Blade,4,0,"A large bleeding bone protrusion comes out of Shotel’s left arm, as she swipes upwards to create a 12 range piercing slice of blood that moves along the ground dealing 4 damage to everyone hit. When used by Orthrus it can fire out three of these waves in one action."
ability,Shotel,Kick His Teeth Out,2,0,"Shotel lifts her boot and kicks, moving 1 space forwards as she does so. Upon contact, the hit enemy takes 4 damage and is knocked back up to 6 spaces! However, if 12 damage will knock the enemy out it will deal that much instead. This factors in Go For The Kill as well. When used by Orthrus it loses the bonus knockout range but becomes a tackle, with Orthrus moving with the hit enemy alongside the attack and knocking them prone. It may immediately take another action that isn’t Kick His Teeth Out."
weapon,Silas,Knuckle Sandwich,,0,"A classic. Can’t beat it! Can beat them up, though. Eat this! 4 damage 1 range."
weapon,Silas,Batter Up,,0,"A mundane wooden baseball bat. Effective, but it sure is a normal ass bat. Might break if under enough stress. When Silas chooses a Partner, this weapon may potentially change into something else to match the Partner’s aesthetic. 5 damage 1 range."
talent,Silas,"Always a Bridesmaid, Never a Bride",,0,"Silas is always looking out for his friends, and his Epithet can ensure things go well for them (no matter the cost). Silas can transfer any effects or “conceptual things” that he currently has that could be considered positive or useful to his Partner. Conversely, his Partner can transfer any negative effects or conceptual things to Silas. These both share a Once per Round usage, which can be activated on either Silas’s or his Partner’s turns as a Free Action."
talent,Silas,Best Friends Forever!,,0,"Despite being an Epithet User, Silas gains the benefits of being a Synchronized Mundie! Similarly, if the GM feels that Silas and his Partner worked especially well together in a Combat/Scenario, the two of them can gain an additional Companionship compared to what would otherwise be given."
passive,Silas,Leave It To Me!,,1,"On its own, Silas’s Epithet isn’t able to flourish. Silas’s strengths lie in those around him that he can support with all of his will. It’s their time to shine. At the start of a combat/scenario, Silas is able to select a Partner from any of his party members. Upon doing so, his body and outfit may shift to match their aesthetic, as his Epithet attunes to them, their essence, and their capabilities. When rolling Initiative, the Partner essentially has Advantage, able to select either their rolled result or Silas’s. Silas can choose to have his turn occur immediately after his Partner’s if he so desires. When Dual Teching with his Partner, not only are his Partner’s capabilities bolstered and able to be stretched, but also, either he or his Partner roll with Advantage. Similarly, as a Once per Round, Unrolled Anytime, Silas can give up his next Main Action to grant his Partner Advantage on a roll. (Prof 8) Silas Will Now DIE For You - If Silas’s Partner would be knocked to or below 0 Stamina due to an incoming attack and/or effect, and they are within Silas’s Movement Speed, Silas can spring to action: diving into his partner, knocking them out of the way and taking the attack instead of them. This must be rolled for, but if Silas and his Partner have 5 or more Companionship with each other, it has Advantage. This counts as an Epithet Effect. Once per Combat. (Prof 15) On The Same Wavelength - Silas and his Partner can communicate telepathically!"
passive,Silas,The Support,,1,"When Silas would target a member of his “Team” with any action that specifies them as the target, he may choose before rolling to simply take 10 on his roll. If he does not take 10 on the roll, Silas may reroll a failed roll targeting an ally this round so long as it is not a critical failure, or have a critical failure resolve as a normal failure."
ability,Silas,Right Hand Man,1,0,"Silas turns to his Partner...The Partner can now wield Silas as a weapon. Like literally. Regardless of the Partner’s physical strength, they are able to grab/lift Silas, as his Epithet makes it so, to the Partner, Silas feels as light as a feather. Conversely, when hitting other units or objects, Silas becomes far more solid, making it so he doesn’t take recoil from normal swings. Upkeep 1. Inherently, Silas deals around 6-8 damage and has 1 range as a melee weapon. He can also be thrown. Depending on Silas’s Partner and how said Partner has caused Silas to change, Silas may gain extra properties as a weapon! Anything on the Partner’s kit that utilizes their Basic Weapon(s) can instead use Silas. Using Silas as a weapon counts as Dual Teching. (Prof 13) Weapon Bonding - Silas, when used as a weapon via Right Hand Man, gains +2 damage (4-6 to 6-8). Along with this, if he and his Partner have Companionship Upgrades, the “Silas Weapon” can/may gain additional properties based off of those Companionship Upgrades, regardless of if that specific upgrade relates to Right Hand Man."
ability,Silas,Color Commentary,1!,1,"As his Partner performs an action, Silas’s Epithet springs to life, putting him on the same wavelength so that he can understand what they’re going for. As this happens, Silas explains exactly what is happening, or at least what his Partner is going for, literally reading the action’s text in-universe. The only difference is that things mentioning statistics directly in “game mechanic speak” are instead heard as something that would make more sense for people actually living in this world. Doing this either grants the action a variable roll buff, or allows its effects to be bolstered, as Silas or his Partner explains why exactly they are doing what they are doing. This can add extra damage, inflict statuses, or other strange effects depending on the exact scenario. Once per Round."
ability,Silas,In Your Footsteps,X,0,"This ability changes into something entirely new depending on Silas’s Partner. Its restrictions are that: - It is scaled based off of Silas’s Proficiency - It is specifically to be used to either directly support, combo off of, or lead into the action of Silas’s Partner (oftentimes whichever would fit most with their gameplan) - It either somehow matches the Partner’s aesthetic(s) or is conversely a more mundane seeming technique that Silas could likely perform without an Epithet (although in this case it still counts as an Epithet effect) - If this created ability is used to support anyone other than Silas’s Partner, it rolls with Disadvantage (unless it somehow also directly impacts the Partner in some way) - This ability can also be used to do something based off of the Partner’s power(s)/aesthetic(s), but scaled to Silas’s Proficiency. In this case, X is typically decided by GM "
weapon,Taliesin,Truth's Saber,,0,"A holy sword, constructed of Taliesin’s Epithet, ready to slash through injustice. Deals 5 holy damage as a melee weapon, and can cleave, but doing so makes it only deal 3 damage. (Prof 19) Pursue Justice - Truth’s Saber’s crit range is increased to 19+, which is further increased to 17+ if Taliesin is within the areas created from either Guiding Light or Strike Them Down!."
weapon,Taliesin,Mighty Shield,,0,"Taliesin raises his Epithet-constructed shield, combining this attack with his movement to charge forward! Deals 3 damage to those rammed into, and the shield blocks incoming projectiles and potentially some physical attacks that would otherwise interrupt the attack."
talent,Taliesin,Quite The Crowd Pleaser,,0,"Taliesin, due to his status as both a superhero and a famous superhero actor means that quite a few people know who he is. As such, he is typically able to roll with advantage on any sort of charisma related checks, not restricted to persuasion, deception, or charming others."
passive,Taliesin,The Light Which Illuminates All,,1,"Taliesin’s Epithet, when fully activated, is what morphs his attire into his superhero garments. Similarly, it begins producing a 5ft radiant aura of light that Taliesin has active at all times. Not only does it automatically reveal enemies that are currently in stealth, but whenever Taliesin or one of his allies attacks an enemy within the aura, a “Hero Rank” is added onto either the attacker or the attacked (which is Taliesin’s choice). Spending Hero Ranks - Hero Ranks can then be spent as a once per turn anytime. If spent on an enemy, it deals damage equal to the number of spent Ranks +1. If spent on Taliesin or an ally, they can either be used to heal 1 stamina for each spent Rank - 1 (minimum of 1), or improve a roll by the number of spent Ranks +1. However, Hero Ranks are also able to be spent to level up the abilities of Taliesin or his allies. All of Taliesin’s abilities have specified level up effects, while his allies may take properties of one of Taliesin’s abilities and apply them to their own. True Justice - If Taliesin or an ally reach 7 or more Hero Ranks, they achieve “True Justice” Form. This boosts their damage and movement by their accumulated Hero Ranks divided by 2 (rounded up). Also, if they successfully damage an enemy with a roll higher than their current number of Hero Ranks (or a Nat 20), they can spend all of their Ranks to baton pass an action to a chosen ally. (Prof 16) Make a Lasting Impact - The spirit of heroism isn’t snuffed out so easily. At the end of combat, Taliesin can choose one member of his party to keep all Hero Ranks currently on them into the next combat. The person he chooses also gains 1 Rank at the start of the next combat, which they can place on themselves or an enemy of their choice."
ability,Taliesin,Guiding Light,3,0,"With an extended hand, Taliesin produces a 3x3 pillar of light onto the field. This deals 1 damage to any enemies inside, and conversely heals all allies for 1 stamina, while all inside immediately gain 2 Hero Ranks. This area is able to be directly influenced by Taliesin as a free action on his turn, allowing him to terraform it, produce effects, or other feats of will. If an ally performs an action while inside the area, Taliesin can pay the stamina cost of that action +1 to assist via the power of the area. Only one of these areas can be present on the field at the time. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. While a Guiding Light area is present on the battlefield, Taliesin can choose a member of his party to be “connected” to the area. This means that whenever the Guiding Light Area is terraformed/altered, a similar change can be applied to that team member. For example, creating a Ballista Tower in the area may give the member a light construct crossbow they can use to augment their actions in some way. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Whenever a unit starts their turn in a Guiding Light area, or is in one at the start of Taliesin’s turns, they gain 1 Hero Rank. This also grants 1 Hero Rank to the unit that is “connected” to the area, but only at the start of Taliesin’s turns. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. The effects granted from Level 3 now grant 2 Hero Ranks instead of one. Taliesin can now have multiple Guiding Light areas on the field at a time. (Prof 22) Keep on the Pressure - The area produced from Guiding Light not only counts as an aura for The Light Which Illuminates All (that does not stack with Taliesin’s base aura), but when an enemy inside of it is attacked, there is a 50% (1d2) chance that they are inflicted with the Link Strike Status. This status lasts until the top of the next round, and when an afflicted unit takes damage, the unit that inflicted this status rolls to immediately perform a basic attack on them regardless of range."
ability,Taliesin,Strike Them Down!,1,1,"With an outward stretch of his arm, Taliesin creates a sword made of light in midair. This sword can originate anywhere within 4 spaces of Taliesin as it zooms towards a space/unit of Taliesin’s choice also within 4 spaces of his current position, and if it hits a unit, Taliesin can choose for it to deal up to 4 damage. A hit unit loses buffs, debuffs, and/or status effects currently on them of Taliesin’s choice. However, if this strikes an empty space, the sword instead creates a 3x3 area with the effects of Taliesin’s Passive. Similarly, Taliesin can choose to have the origin point of any future uses of this ability be in this created area. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. Once this ability connects with an enemy target, a second light sword begins spiraling around them. In up to 4 turns (Taliesin’s choice of which turn), this sword shall activate, piercing into the target and exploding. This deals 1 damage, but inflicts decent knockback, and, if this is taking place on the affected unit’s turn, this will specifically activate during their action in an attempt to throw them off. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin is now able to have the swords created from this ability be varying types of swords. This may influence their damage, range, and other secondary properties. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. Upon hitting enemy targets, they are now surrounded by 3 light swords that function the same as the spiraling swords granted in Level 2. Along with this, Taliesin can elect to not have the spiral swords effect activate, and in doing so, allowing him to use this ability as a Bonus Action. (Prof 13) Spread Your Influence - Swords created from Strike Them Down! now remain on the field after being initially fired. If stuck in a unit, it produces a 5ft aura of light that functions the same as the aura from The Light Which Illuminates All that can stack with Taliesin’s own aura. If stuck on an otherwise empty space, it acts as a turret that Taliesin can fire further instances of the ability from without taking up his own main action. Only one sword can do this per turn."
ability,Taliesin,Hero Signal,2!,1,"Suddenly, a beam of light pierces the sky, showcasing an emblem representing Taliesin’s superhero persona! Not one to ignore a call to action, Taliesin immediately jumps over to the symbol’s position. If it is shining upon either an “evil” target or a current source of damage/attacking force, Taliesin can immediately perform an interrupting basic attack. The space the light shines upon must be within 6 spaces of Taliesin’s current position. Once per Round. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. Upon reaching his chosen destination via this ability, the cast spotlight reflects off of him, placing 1 Hero Rank on every enemy within 2 spaces of him. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Hero Signal no longer needs to target an evil target/current source of damage in order to perform the follow-up basic attack, and if Taliesin wants, he can choose to have the initial roll for this ability be used for said basic attack. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin’s blade shines with a radiant sheen as he zooms to his target. The range of this ability is increased by 1, and all enemies he passes by (adjacent) on his way to his target are struck for 4 damage as a sword slash manifests in the air. (Prof 28) Stay Vigilant - After attacking via Hero Signal, if there are any other enemies within 3 spaces of the first target, Taliesin can pay 1 stamina to immediately jump over to them and attack, a shining cone of light surrounding him like a sonic boom. These chain attacks deal additional damage to summons/mooks (including the initial target if Taliesin specified he was going to chain before he rolled for the action). If there are no other enemies in range (or if he simply elects to), Taliesin can instead pay 2 stamina to attack the initial target again (this type of chain can only occur up to twice). Once this chain is finished, Taliesin can move 2 spaces before the interaction is resolved. While chaining, the Level 4 effect of Hero Signal cannot hit the same unit twice in the same interaction."
ability,Taliesin,Reflect Radiance,2,0,"Taliesin produces a floating, yellow crystal on an empty space within 4 of his current location. These crystals can take in light produced from actions/people/objects within 3 spaces of it (which must be rolled for), and then Taliesin can pay 1 stamina to have the crystal reflect said light onto a space either back at the source or at another location within 2 of it as an anytime action (once per round per crystal). Anything this light strikes may be inflicted with an effect based on properties of the stored light that the crystal is using. If Taliesin is the one hit by this, beneficial effects gained from it are typically slightly better than when used on others. Bonus Action. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. When projecting effects using a crystal produced by Reflect Radiance, Taliesin is now able to fuse multiple “light sources” together to create an amalgamated effect out of all of them! This can either be a strange combination of effects from all light sources, or something brand new as a result of the fusion. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin no longer needs to roll to store light within a crystal produced by Reflect Radiance. He can choose to roll if wants, and if he succeeds the roll, 1d2 Hero Ranks are placed on the unit that is acting as the light source. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin can produce up to 2 crystals in a single usage of Reflect Radiance. Crystals can move up to 4 spaces on Taliesin’s turns. Light sources can be shared and/or fused between crystals."
ability,Taliesin,(Martial Technique) Mirror Image,X,1,"With a glowing outline illuminating his form as his aura glows even brighter, several images step out of Taliesin's space to mask his location. When this ability is used, he may create a number of mirror images up to his base movement speed by paying one stamina per image, which may move up to half of his movement speed away. Taliesin may also move up to half of his movement speed and, at any point on his turn as a once per round free action, he may swap locations with any of his images through trickery of the light and sheer speed. The images can not take any other action on Taliesin's turn other than moving at half speed, though while any of them are active it is incredibly difficult to discern which is the real Taliesin. This ability may be used as a Movement Action. Taliesin may only have a maximum number of images active at once equal to his base movement speed. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. The images are now able to move up to their full speed, and upon swapping, Taliesin may choose to perform a minor follow-up action. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin is now able to swap places with the images twice per round and have any of his actions/effects originate from their spaces by spending one of their once per round swaps, quickly swapping to their location, using the action/effect, and then swapping back. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. The images may now attempt to attack a target for half of Taliesin’s base basic attack damage rounded down, and share the effects of The Light Which Illuminates All, although they only gain half of the benefits Taliesin usually would. Only one of the images’ auras can stack with Taliesin’s own at a time."
weapon,Wight,Himawari,,0,"An ages-old katana that has miraculously been preserved in near peak state. It has the words “Stay true to yourself” engraved within the blade. With Wight’s mechanization, it has been attached in a groove in their right arm. 5 damage 1 range (Prof 7) Sharpened Blade - Himawari gains +1 damage (5 to 6)."
weapon,Wight,Revenant Burst,,0,Wight channels a portion of spirit and performs a quick slash with their katana. This produces a blue cutter projectile that can slice through the toughest of foes. 3 damage 3 range. (Prof 22) Specter Kegare - Revenant Burst now inflicts a Curse Effect that makes an afflicted unit’s non-attacking rolls suffer a -3 until the status can be staved off. (Prof 35) Persist Spirit - Revenant Burst gains +5 Range (3 to 8).
talent,Wight,Strength of Possession,,1,"Being what is essentially a possessed suit of armor, Wight can disassemble themselves and allow someone else to wear them. Doing this makes it so they share a single turn, gain 2 DR, and have their actions boosted to approximately double effectiveness. This also adds a cursed blue/black/purple flame attribute that can be applied to actions. (Prof 20) Stronger Together - While Strength of Possession is active, both parties get a plus to their rolls equal to their companionship with each other halved rounded down, capping at +5. (Prof 32) Instant Armor - Strength of Possession can be used as an anytime on allies within Wight Movement Speed."
talent,Wight,Thermal Vision,,0,"Designed in the shinobi arts of stealth and assassination, Wight’s vision can view heat on objects. By detecting irregularities in the heat on spaces, Wight can track people’s locations from the very recent past, and see through some illusions and forms of invisibility. Of course, as this relies on heat it only works in the right scenarios."
talent,Wight,Curse Body,,0,"Due to the strange non-biological nature of Wight’s body, they tend to shrug off many status effects. If a status would realistically be ineffective against pure armor, then Wight suffers halved effectiveness from them rounded down (which can theoretically cancel a weaker status outright)."
talent,Wight,"All Armor, No Weakness",,0,"Wight gains 1 DR. In addition, Wight is immune to “critical damage” AKA the increased damage they take due to a crit both from the innate doubling and any other damaging effects."
passive,Wight,Schrödinger’s Samurai,,2,"Due to a combination of their Epithet and their spirit-like makeup, many aspects of Wight are not only in constant flux, but also incredibly unpredictable. At a point of their choosing, Wight can select an aspect of themselves or their kit and make it so one trait of said aspect is certain, while a second is uncertain. The certain trait is definite and unchangeable, while the uncertain trait is vague enough to be arbitrarily malleable to Wight’s (or potentially others’) desires. If Wight ever desires to change the aspect that is affected by this Passive, they must spend 1 stamina at the start of their turn to do so. (Prof 13) Swift Switch - Wight has trained to be swift and decisive when suddenly thrust into unexpected scenarios. Switching out Schrödinger’s Samurai’s targets at the start of Wight’s turn now has a sort of extreme priority to it, meaning that it activates first before Wight suffers any “start of turn” effects like statuses, terrain based effects, or anything of that sort. The switch is effectively always the first thing that happens on Wight’s turn."
passive,Wight,One Man Army,,0,"Their memories may have been lost to time, but within Wight still lingers the art of war they were once so proficient in. Whenever Wight would be attacked successfully while they’ve already been attacked successfully since their last turn, they can make a free counter-attack roll. This not only mitigates damage, but if Wight rolls 3 higher than what their enemy rolled, they can immediately perform an action so long as it’s a damaging action that targets the attacker."
passive,Wight,Collapse of A Dynasty,,0,"Wight can harness the codes of Bushido in combat, and collapse the possibilities of combat into their favor. Whenever Wight is attacked, they place a stack of Bushido on that person. Wight deals +1 damage to targets per Bushido stack they have, and their anytimes used to avoid Wight’s attacks receive an equivalent minus to the roll. Bushido caps out at 5 on a target."
ability,Wight,As The Sun Sets,3,1,"After crouching for a moment, Wight lunges at a target within 4 spaces of themselves, slashing through them and landing up to 3 spaces behind them. At first, despite the spectacle, nothing seems to have happened to the target, but they were most certainly struck by the sword. From here, Wight can activate an anytime to have the effect of the strike occur when they want. This can be straight damage, which usually ranges around 9-12, or potentially something a bit more strange if Wight desires. Stamina cost for this ability is only paid once the anytime is activated, and Wight can only have one use of this ability active at a time."
ability,Wight,Probability Smoke Cloud,3,2,"Wight makes use of the traditional shinobi smoke bomb technique, creating a 3x3 square of white smoke centered on them. While in these smoke clouds, Wight can be in any number of the spaces within, essentially allowing them to warp around at will or act as multiple forces at once. If there are multiple smoke clouds in the arena, Wight can warp between them."
ability,Wight,Wave Function,2,0,"Wight reaches out to an adjacent target and surges a portion of their Epithet into it. This allows them to imbue said target with a weaker version of Wight’s Passive, causing a trait (chosen by Wight) to either become certain or uncertain. This only can apply one effect at once, and is typically weaker than what is gained through Wight’s standard Passive."
ability,Wight,Soul Residue,1,0,"Wight’s blade and armor begin to whistle as a yellow aura surrounds their blade, allowing them to take a definite, observable quality of something with 3 spaces and store it within the sword’s engraving. These properties can be applied retroactively to Wight's As The Sun Sets triggers. If they desire, Wight can use this ability in the form of a sword slash, releasing all qualities with it, augmenting the attack and dealing +3 damage per quality released"
ability,Wight,Eliminate All Possibilities,3,0,"Make the future certain through use of your epithet and an understanding of your opponent. Wight can spend 3 stacks of Bushido on a target, to force their next main action on their turn to be a specific weapon or ability of theirs of Wight’s choice. If they have more than one main action on that turn, Wight can decide all of them. Wight cannot force someone to double move this way. If this ability fails, they only spend 1 stack of Bushido on the target. Bonus Action."
weapon,Javier,Leg Hammer,,0,"Kicks are Javier’s go-to to make people go the hell away. He’s fought his way through quite a few scraps before, so he knows what he’s doing. 5 damage 1 range."
talent,Javier,Effective Reference,,0,"Javier has near photographic memory, and seeing as how he is an artist of sorts, is also particularly good at making scale models. As such, given enough time and materials, he is able to take things he sees and recreate them in figure form."
passive,Javier,It's Free Real Estate,,2,"Javier’s Epithet manifests as a subspacial mini-dimension containing only a strange “house” that is directly linked to Javier’s being. It can only be traveled to by means of a key that Javier possesses, and he has the ability to eject anyone out of the house if he so desires. All of the rooms in this house vary wildly in terms of theming and items within, and Javier is able to link himself to the room he was in most recently. Doing this grants Javier access to the “character sheet” of the room, which follows the primary theming of the room and its contents to create its aspects. The more focused a given room is in theming, the more powerful its kit can be. At base, a room’s character sheet will never be “complete”, lacking multiple things a regular character sheet would normally have, and Javier can exchange any of his own Proficiency Upgrades to give one to a room of his choice. Any items that Javier brings into a room stay in that room until they are specifically moved. Javier’s Current Rooms https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NyzRRSndAS4GMjuIv9-74ek52qbgOhMfJBYZ7lZpxI/edit?usp=sharing (Prof 32) Home Field Advantage - Javier’s house provides him with a natural heightened awareness in combat while he’s inside it, as the house acts as an extension of himself. This means he has advantage on all actions that are targeting an enemy inside his house so long as he is also inside it."
ability,Javier,Trashin' It,3,0,"Javier begrudgingly takes his key and kicks it above a 3x3 area of his choice on the battlefield. The key then clicks into place, opening a door to a room of Javier’s choice as items from the room begin spilling out in a torrent. This deals variable, but large amounts of damage as well as potential status effects depending on the items that come crashing down. Javier can choose one item to keep in the room if he wants, but everything else is fair game to be lost in the scuffle. Of course, if Javier is able to recollect the items, he can place them back into his house, but that’s assuming his enemies will let him. This ability affects everyone in the 3x3 area regardless of allegiance."
ability,Javier,Foxtrot Box,2!,1,"Javier produces a door that he jumps through, thereby producing a correlating door on a space up to 6 away from his current location that he appears out from. These doors remain on the field and have 4 stamina each, as well as produce a pink, 3x3 box around themselves. The box’s walls are intangible and Javier can roll to redirect anything (producing a tangible object/attack) within them through the opposite door and onto a new target for 1 stamina. Or, if he desires, he can roll to store an action used within a box into a chosen room, creating an object representative of said action, which often costs him stamina. Only two doors can be present on the field at a time. Once per Round"
ability,Javier,Picture Perfect,X,0,"With a puff of his cigarette, Javier chooses up to two targets within 7 spaces of each other and rearranges them to make a scene of his liking. He cannot make units use abilities with this, but he is able to pose them however he can imagine. (Prof 38) Composition Opportunity - On top of the chosen cost of Picture Perfect, Javier may choose to pay an additional 3 stamina before rolling. If he succeeds, then he can immediately take an action that isn’t an ability, with the exception being abilities from his currently linked room."
ability,Javier,House Party,3⛯,0,"And YOU’RE invited (whether you like it or not)! Javier kicks an adjacent unit, knocking them into a door which leads to Javier’s currently linked room. Javier jumps in after them, creating a 1-on-1 fight between him and the target. The two fight for three consecutive rounds before the target is forcibly ejected back to where they were. Javier can either come with them, or stay in the house. It takes one full movement action to return to the standard battlefield from his house. Once per Combat."
ability,Javier,Home Away From Home,3,0,"While Javier is never far from his house, he still likes to keep pictures of his house on him. Not to remember them, since he has a photographic memory, but instead to inform others of their artistic setup. By throwing one of these into the center of the room, a sort of holographic projection of a room of his choice becomes overlaid on the arena in an area of equivalent size to the room. This creates an effect in that area based on the aesthetic of the room, decided by Javier. This has an upkeep of 2 stamina a round, unless he is projecting his linked room. Once per Combat."
weapon,Justus,Vicious Riven,,0,"Red energy forms around Justus’s hands to create claws which rake in blood from his enemies. Inflicts 1 Bloody, and heals him for half the damage dealt rounded down. 5 damage 1 range."
weapon,Justus,Taunt,,0,"Does not require a roll. As an action Justus does some kind of cocky flourish or jeer towards an enemy, giving him +1 crit range until he next crits this combat. (Prof 20) Apply Directly To The Forehead - Justus taunts more than just to showboat! I mean… he still does, but he also does it to lure an enemy into a mistake! Whenever Justus uses his Taunt action, the next attack coming against him from a Vassal this round rolls with disadvantage."

talent,Justus,Bloody Stream,,0,"At the start of Justus's turn, he may put 1 Bloody stack on himself."
passive,Justus,Til Death Do Us Part,,1,"People call you Prince for a good reason. Your epithet’s primary power allows you to lend a fraction of your own ability, and in return gain supremacy and fealty over that person whether they like it or not. Upon making any kind of physical contact with someone, you may as an unrolled anytime action give them some of your power. This can be an abstract skill such as “general damage” or even another part of your kit, with you inversely losing whatever you give for the combat. However, in return that person becomes your “vassal” for the rest of combat. This affects some of your abilities, and allows your actions to have “supremacy” over theirs. This makes it significantly harder for them to mess with any of your actions when you don’t want them to, and much easier for you to mess with theirs. You also only take 1.5x damage from critical hits by your vassals. Upon a vassal being defeated, you debt a part of their soul in allegiance to you, adding them to your Liege List. Whenever you successfully perform a main action, you can pay 1 stamina and cause spectral versions of a single Liege’s weapons/body parts/other relevant pieces to form around you, as you perform a follow up action that is related to that person in some way. This does not copy their mechanics, rather the follow up relates to the general abilities/fighting style they could accomplish. The more stylish and creative the usage, the stronger the effect. If this succeeds you can do this *again*, so long as you don’t pick the same Liege from earlier in the chain and you pay double the stamina cost, and so on. Liege List: - Jeanne - Minos - Zell Caveat - Gulliver Bradshaw - Atlas Petrov - Tenacious Jack - Manti-CORE - Yig"
ability,Justus,Regicide Curtana,1,0,"Justus uses his epithet to create a ceremonial sword of blood and energy. However, the space it is targeting alters its effects! - If it hits an adjacent target, then it deals an initial 2 damage and inflicts 2 Bloody, followed by a massive kick by Justus himself to launch them high into the air, dealing another 4 damage and giving a general boost to success and damage to any follow up Justus chooses to perform. - If it hits a target 2 range out, they simply take 2 damage and 2 Bloody stacks, and Justus heals for half the damage dealt and half the damage of his follow up, rounded down. - If it hits a target 3 or 4 range out, then instead of a usual hit a trap will be left on the field, composed of epithet nettles. Should an enemy touch it, they will immediately take 7 damage and gain 5 Bloody Stacks. However, this cannot be placed directly on targets. - If between 5 and 8 range, the spike will turn into a scythe during its travel arc, before sticking the target to the ground! They can use half their movement to remove the spike at the cost of taking 3 damage and a Bloody Stack, or they can spend their full movement to remove it safely. Stuck targets take additional damage when they would be knocked back. However, more importantly if this hits Justus can take an immediate move action, which can happen before or after Justus does a follow up with his passive."
ability,Justus,Fury on High,X,1,"From the sky a cannonball-like energy projectile appears, Justus having kicked it and infused it with power before the session. This deals X+2 damage on a 3x3 area that has its origin within 4 to 5 spaces from Justus exactly. It also has a shockwave effect, knocking everyone other than Justus (or any vassals he doesn’t want to move) within 3 spaces of the cannonball back 5 spaces. The cannonball is extremely hard to move except for Justus, who can move it without even being slowed. As a Main Action, Justus can turn the cannonball that’s left on the battlefield into a massive 3x3 gallows platform with a sawblade that deals 2 damage and inflicts 1 Bloody to everyone inside every turn (not rounds) for X turns, before disappearing."
ability,Justus,Public Execution,1/2 current,0,"Justus slashes out some of his own blood, covering a 3x3 area whose center is 4 spaces away from him, stacking 3 Bloody on himself. This blood stays on the battlefield until activated as an anytime, although Justus may have it activate immediately with the same roll as what was used to place it. The blood there is expanded by Justus’ epithet as all targets inside are dragged into the blood like a waste-deep pool, as a massive guillotine is created by Justus’ epithet. He begins laughing maniacally, as all targets take 10 damage and gain 5 Bloody Stacks, and he can perform follow ups with his passive to this regardless of the turn it was used on. Once per Combat."
ability,Justus,Puppet State,1!,1,"Justus pulls around a target Vassal almost like a ragdoll, red energy threads puppeting them around. This allows him to move them up to their movement speed in any direction, even hoisting them up in the air or moving them into harm’s way. It can be used to trip up a target to interrupt their action as well. It can alternatively be used to force the vassal to use an action, so long as that action relies exclusively on physical effort (so for example, activating an epithet is generally mental and thus you could not do that). Once per Round"
weapon,Leon,THE MEGA-GLOVE,,0,"The almighty MEGA-GLOVE of gaming legend. Leon looks rad as hell while punching with it. The MEGA-GLOVE also allows Leon to control any video game or technology!..though the more modern the technology is, the harder it is to control. 4 damage 1 range. (Prof 18) Marth’s Grab Range - The MEGA-GLOVE’s range is increased from 1 to 2. (Prof 45) Sephiroth’s Forward Smash - +1 damage and range to The Mega-Glove (4/2 to 5/3). (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Leon’s technomancy has been enhanced! Controlling technology with The MEGA-Glove is now a Bonus Action. Technomancer Technocrasher - Leon now has Double Advantage on destroying cars (previously Single Advantage)."
talent,Leon,Core Mechanic,,1,"Thanks to his limited control on his epithet’s effects, Leon can decide what kind of game he’s living in at the current moment. At the beginning of a combat/scenario, he can declare what the “mechanic” of the game is. Depending on the mechanic, Leon can decide whether it affects just him, just his party, or everyone in combat. Performing actions according to this mechanic will net Leon bonus points as per Life’s Just a Game (up to GM)."
talent,Leon,Continue?,,1,"When Leon is knocked out for the first time within a combat, any ally can take 10 damage to put in another coin for him, revived with 7 stamina. Talk about bros. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Taking damage from Continue? cannot reduce an ally’s stamina below 1, unless they are one of Leon’s summons."
passive,Leon,Life's Just a Game,,0,"Life for Leon is literally a game, thanks to his Epithet. Leon gains “Points” (stored as his Red Stat) for successfully performing actions, and he can then spend these points on upgrades and powers from classic arcade games. Different actions give different amounts of points depending on the action itself and how successful it is. The more difficult the action, the more points earned, and the more powerful the power-up, the more points it requires (the GM can give Leon points at their discretion). Point Guide: - Dealing damage up to 5 - +50 - Dealing 6+ damage - +100 - Rolling a 20 - +50,  - Basic Actions - +10  - Advanced - +30 - Insane - +50 (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Conditions of the Point Guide now stack with each other. For instance, a “Basic Action” that deals up to 5 damage now grants around 60 points instead of around 50. Along with this, Leon’s summons can now grant him Points with their actions (except for Player 2)!"
passive,Leon,BONUS ROUND!!!,,0,"Using 300 Points (at base), Leon can go into a Bonus Round, giving him an extra turn! Every 50 additional points above 300 that Leon has, his High Score gets updated, which also updates the cost. Using Bonus Round also increases his High Score by 50. This only resets back to 300 upon the session ending. Leon also gets Double Advantage on destroying cars. (Prof 39) Top of the World - Every time Leon gets a High Score, his next roll gets a +3."
passive,Leon,Skill Tree,,1,"Being a Gamer, Leon is used to needing to re-spec to be able to play to his team’s strengths, or the enemies weakness. At any point during combat, Leon can reduce up to two of his “stats” (anything from more standard things like damage, or something more strange like “jump ability”, even max stamina) to amplify another 1-2 stats. The reduction of stats needs to negatively impact Leon in some way. The first time Leon does this within a combat, it is free, but from that point onward, if Leon wants to re-spec himself, he must pay a variable amount of stamina on his turn to do so. If he desires, Leon can place the positive effects of Skill Tree onto an ally within The MEGA-Glove’s range instead of himself. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Instead of “at the start of combat”, Leon can now re-spec via Skill Tree at a point of his choice, further detailed within the new text of the Passive"

Re-roll if there aren’t multiple enemies in the combat. - 8 - Help an ally that’s in trouble! Leon’s summons count as allies for this. - 9 - Top your last High Score. This result can’t be in the code more than once, and, if rolled, is always the last result in the order. - 10 - Have an Epic Gamer Moment. Can be done out of order.

ability,Leon,EX Move,X,0,"With a flurry of movements Leon unleashes his Super Gauge! Perform a non-ability action which becomes mystically amplified with energy to have significantly increased effectiveness. Points are required and burned to use this ability (100 base, but more points can be added to further increase the effect). (Prof 60) Retro Revival - While its “base” cost is still 1, EX Move is now an X cost. As with other X costs, Leon can spend more stamina for a bigger payout."
ability,Leon,Power Path,1!,1,"Channeling one of his favorite arcade games, Leon creates a path of up to 5 pixelated pellets connected in a line (each pellet is 1 space/5ft) and munches his way through them, dealing 4 damage to enemies caught in his path and gaining points for objects eaten. This ability can have Leon travel in any direction. Once per Round. (Prof 57) PAC-MAN Fever - When using Power Path, Leon can choose to pay an additional 1 stamina to produce a Power Pellet at the end of his Power Path. If this is done, every enemy that was hit by Power Path goes into “Blue Mode”, where their entire body turns a dark shade of blue. Once they are in this state, Leon’s next attack against them deals 1.5X damage, and grants him boosted points (he even gets Points when using EX Move)! Alternatively, if Leon does not hit any units with Power Path, he can choose to pay the additional 1 stamina to increase Power Path’s range by 4."
ability,Leon,Bootleggin' It!,3⛯,1,"If something has gotten popular, you can be sure someone out there has created a rip-off version. Of course, Leon likes to collect bootleg games and merchandise for fun (he thinks they’re funny). With this knowledge in tow, Leon can channel his Epithet to summon a knockoff version of any character (though their effectiveness is not guaranteed). Once per Combat. (Prof 54) I Choose You! - When using Bootleggin’ It, Leon can choose to instead summon his partner Pokémon: Steelix! Steelix is a 3x3 unit, has 15 Stamina, 4 Movement, and 2 DR. However, Steelix is subject to Pokémon typing modifiers. Due to influence from Leon’s Epithet, Steelix is able to re-spec itself such that it isn’t locked to the typical 4 Moves, and Leon can choose its “Ability” when it is summoned. Summoning Steelix does not spend Bootleggin’ It’s Once per Combat usage. Critting on this variation allows Leon, if he desires, to immediately use another summoning ability as the primary Crit Effect."
ability,Leon,Ultra Combo,3⛯,1,"It’s time for a Killer K-K-K-K-Kombo!! An aura of Gamer energy flares up around Leon, as he goes to go to town on an adjacent unit. This allows Leon to start up a combo chain on the targeted unit, with the roll for activation acting as the first hit. Leon can perform up to 3 attacks in this combo, unless he crits on an attack, which grants him an additional attack above the usual max. Each attack is based off of a fighting game move of Leon’s choice, which can provide variable effects depending on what exactly it is! After any attack in the chain, Leon can choose to cancel the attack into EX Move, which ends the chain immediately after. Much like fighting game combos, depending on the strength of the attacks and the length of the combo, damage is explicitly proliferated. If Leon successfully lands 3 or more attacks with this chain, this ability goes on Recharge 5-6 once it has concluded. Leon can perform this ability by canceling out of either one of his damaging Main Actions or the damaging Main Action of one of his summons, using that as a Hit Confirm. If Leon does this, he must pay 5 stamina for this ability instead of 3, however, assuming the initial “Hit Confirm” successfully connected, the affected unit(s) are unable to use any reactions to stop Ultra Combo as they are stuck in hitstun."
ability,Leon,SUPER Glove Arts,3!,2,"Raising The MEGA-Glove skyward, Leon activates one of his MEGA-GLOVE Arts, all of which have various effects! Glove Arts fade one full round after being activated, although Leon can deactivate one at any time he wants during his turn. The same Art cannot be used back to back, needing a 2 round cooldown period before it can be used again. Twice per Round. - Jump - Leon can jump incredibly high! While this Art is active, when moving, if Leon jumps, he can essentially move freely upwards as if he is flying. This mainly only applies when ascending, during which Leon gets an additional 3 Movement to use to ascend. He also has radically increased air control, to the point of being practically able to float on high rolls. This gives any attacks initiated in the air a +2 to roll, so long as they somehow incorporate his air control. However, Leon also takes 1.5X damage from any attacks that hit him while this Art is active. - Speed - Leon runs at sonic speed! While this art is active, Leon has doubled Movement Speed, and his movements are generally a lot faster than usual. Reactive Actions attempting to dodge or interrupt Leon roll with -2 while this Art is active. If Leon activates this Art in response to an incoming attack, he can attempt to make a separate dodge roll. However, Leon also has restricted air capabilities, specifically hampering any vertical movement he attempts. Along with this, he deals less damage, usually around 2ish less, more or less depending on the attack(s). - Shield - Leon won’t be taken down by anyone! While this art is active, Leon takes less damage from all attacks (no duh). The exact amount of DR is variable, but as a baseline, it is usually around 2-4 OR ⅔ reduction (whichever is greater). Along with this, he is FAR harder to knock prone or inflict knockback upon, as he becomes extraordinarily heavy. However, he also has his Movement Speed reduced by 2 and can’t move around nearly as well or as fluidly as usual. Enemies may be able to react to his actions easier than before. - Buster - Leon is ready to rumble! While this Art is active, Leon’s damage output is increased by a fair amount. By exactly how much is variable, but it is usually at least 2. However, it is far harder to inflict knockback of any kind, and attacks targeting him have an increased Crit Range of 17+ (if it is an AoE that crits from the expanded range, the crit only affects Leon). - Smash - Leon’s gonna finish this fight! While this Art is active, Leon’s attacks inflict a significantly increased amount of knockback, and he has an expanded Crit Range of 17+. However, not only do attacks inflict more knockback on him, but he also has slightly decreased damage across the board. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Not only has Glove Arts had its effects retooled, but it’s also renamed to SUPER Glove Arts. Radical. Oh also it’s a Twice per Round Anytime now."
ability,Leon,Player 2,3,1,Leon can put another quarter into the machine and give a teammate the experience of being the greatest Gamer on the planet. This summons a 10 stamina Leon Neon that has Leon’s exact kit and powers. Once per Combat.
ability,Leon,Arcade Cabinets,3,0,"Leon can make Arcade Cabinets, almost like his Epithet is Arcade or something. Leon puts The MEGA-Glove to the ground and manifests an Arcade Cabinet up to 2 spaces away from him. This arcade cabinet must be based off of a Cabinet that either exists in real life or is specifically canon to DBA (GAMEMANIA is not allowed). Only one Arcade Cabinet can be on the field at a time, and at any point during his turn, he can have the Cabinet produce an effect/attack relating to its game up to 2 spaces away from it. Cabinets count as summons, and have around 5 stamina.

weapon,Mr Spider,Spider Leg Lances,,0,"A set of, what appears to be, eight blades affixed to Mr. Spider’s back. He controls them in a way that seems very natural as he specifically targets pressure points. On particularly high rolls he may be able to temporarily immobilize selected parts of the target’s body. 5 damage 3 range."
talent,Mr Spider,Business Experience,,0,"Being an industry leader sure is tough work, but it sure does give you a lot of experience on the field. As such, Mr. Spider is very aware of prominent businesses, business workers, and threats to businesses. Plus, he is always ready to promote SpiderCorp!"
talent,Mr Spider,Spider Sense,,0,"Due to a combination of many, many eyes, and a marvelous danger sense, Mr. Spider cannot be blinded, nor can be ambushed."
passive,Mr Spider,Black Widow,,0,"Due to his nature, Mr. Spider is particularly drawn to conflict and the weaving dance it creates. As such, the further enraptured he becomes in a fight, the more fierce he becomes. Each time his webs make contact with a living unit, one of his Spider Leg Lances begins glowing red at its tip. Once all eight have been activated, Mr. Spider’s inner hunter takes over, and his capabilities greatly enhanced. He gains +3 to movement, and a massive boost to the damage and effectiveness of his attacks/abilities. The build-up of this passive carries between combats. (Prof 30) Losers Get Stabbed, It’s That Simple - When Black Widow is active, every attack Mr. Spider lands inflicts a stackable instance of 1d4 damage poison."
ability,Mr Spider,Sticky Situation,1!,1,"Like the tricky bastard that he is, Mr. Spider is able to sneak some webbing from his person onto something or someone else. He can produce the webs from either his hands or his blades, and can then apply the webs in whichever way he sees fit. The webs are incredibly sticky, and, if desired, can be fired up to 5 spaces away from Mr. Spider. Once per round. (Prof 18) Predator VS Prey - If Mr. Spider uses Sticky Situation to pull something towards him, he can immediately stomp it down into the ground, dealing 3 damage and reducing the next movement of the stomped thing by 2. This stomp counts as a basic attack."
ability,Mr Spider,Looks Like You're A Little Tied Up Right Now,3,0,"With a sly smile, Mr. Spider extends his Spider Leg Lances towards an object or person up to 3 spaces away from him and entraps them in a web cocoon.

ability,Mr Spider,A Family Reunion,1,0,"Mr. Spider always carries his legion of baby spiders (branded with the SpiderCorp logo) with him just in case of emergencies. With this ability, he can either call them out to perform an action of his choice or keep them on his body as “armor”. If he is attacked while the armor is up, the spiders scatter off his body and swarm the source of the attack. Each round he maintains the armor, Mr. Spider must pay 1 upkeep. (Prof 27) It’s On The House! - When using Family Reunion, Mr. Spider can make it so the spider babies are holding onto a branded piece of Spider Corp merchandise! Of course, Spider chooses what the merch is. If he does this, the ability costs 2 stamina to use."
ability,Mr Spider,"A Special Surprise, Just For You",2,0,"If there’s one thing Mr. Spider likes doing more than anything else, it’s being a cheeky little shit while others come to a horrible realization. When this ability is activated, Mr. Spider rolls what appears to be a standard basic attack roll. If it is successful, it deals the regular damage, but Mr. Spider has secretly injected a small dose of poison into the target. From here, as an anytime action, he can cause the poison to come into effect, paralyzing the target in their tracks and causing an awful, nauseous feeling. On particularly high rolls, this has the chance to leave the Poison Status on the target even after they are able to move again, taking 1d4 of damage at the start of each of their turns."
ability,Mr Spider,This'll Sting,3,1,"A grin cracks across Mr. Spider’s face as the edges of his mouth sprout a pair of massive chelicerae that latch onto an adjacent unit. This initial bite deals 7-8 damage and causes physical DR a hit unit has to be removed or reduced (if they have any). Mr. Spider can then choose to pay an additional stamina to perform a follow-up kick that deals 3-4 damage and inflicts up to 3 knockback, counting as a basic attack. Along with this, this attack also injects hit units with a “Poisonous Enzyme Status”, which causes their body to begin liquifying as it digests itself. This not only inflicts a -2 roll penalty to all actions for the next round as their body struggles to keep itself solid, but also deals 1d2 damage to an afflicted unit at the start of their turn, which is then given to Mr. Spider as lifesteal. A unit can attempt to dispel this status with a free check at the end of their turn, but rolling lower than a Natural 8 causes the status to worsen, reinstating the roll penalty for an extra round and increasing the damage dice size by 1. When in Black Widow mode, this ability can be used as a Swift Action, but costs 1 extra stamina if used as such"

talent,Pilot,Put it into Words,,0,"Pilot’s writing transcends language in a weird way, making it so that he can write in any language even if he doesn’t know it himself, and anyone can read and understand what he writes even if they don’t know the language it’s written in."
talent,Pilot,Mightier Than The Sword,,0,"To Pilot, Diplomacy itself is a potent weapon, even if it can devolve into childishly whining for what he wants. From now on, diplomacy checks deal actual damage to people while Pilot is in their presence, even if it’s damage to himself. The more convincing or the more pointed at their philosophy the points made are, the more damage they deal."
talent,Pilot,What Are Words Anyway?,,0,Pilot can now write on non-solids.
passive,Pilot,Signature Technique,,0,"Pilot makes sure people know what is and isn’t his by writing his name on any and all objects he owns. This causes the object to “belong to him”, and as such no one other than himself is allowed to touch the thing written on. For example, this is always already done on Pilot’s clothing, making him repulse bare handed attacks to give them disadvantage and push the attacker away.. It’s also virtually impossible to steal from him. He can write signatures on anything he is currently considered to “own” as a bonus action once per round on his turn. Because of the law, human beings cannot be considered “owned”."
passive,Pilot,Lethal Lexicon,,1,"If any of Pilot’s pen ink is on an enemy and they have 5 or less remaining stamina, they are instantly knocked out."
passive,Pilot,Words To Live By,,1,"At the start of combat, Pilot can flip through his dictionary and choose a word with four or more syllables (or alternatively words obtained with Literary Stray Dog). He then writes this on a special piece of gold leaf paper. For the rest of combat, whoever is holding or is adjacent to this paper can incorporate that word into their actions as secondary effects or modifiers. Passing the paper to an adjacent ally is a bonus action and is created under Pilot’s control, obviously. The papers disappear at the end of combat."
ability,Pilot,Descriptive Verbiage,3,0,"With this ability, Pilot can write some kind of adjective onto an adjacent object, and that object begins to take on the attributes of that adjective! The writing is difficult to scrub off since, I mean, it is ink. It is easier to remove from smooth surfaces like metal, compared to things like cloth. (Prof 16) Written Whimsey - Descriptive Verbiage gets a +1 to its roll for each syllable of the adjective used, minus 1. Literary Stray Dog - If Pilot finds any kind of written documents during the session, he can take information from that and use them in place of an adjective or event when using Descriptive Verbiage or Dear Diary. He can’t do this with things he himself has written."
ability,Pilot,Dear Diary,1!,1,"Pilot tends to take notes of an extraordinary event of today in his journal! Of course, Pilot also has a tendency to… “embellish” a little bit. With this, Pilot can write an action or event that has just happened that was especially outstanding in its application or effectiveness, changing around a few smaller details. Then, he can as an action tear this page out, forgetting the point of having a diary to instead perform the embellished version of the action! He can only have one of these stored at a time. Once per Round. Literary Stray Dog - If Pilot finds any kind of written documents during the session, he can take information from that and use them in place of an adjective or event when using Descriptive Verbiage or Dear Diary. He can’t do this with things he himself has written."
ability,Pilot,Scribble Away,1,0,"When Pilot sees something he doesn’t like, he scribbles over it until he forgets it existed! As such, he can use this ability to scribble over the feature of something, causing that feature to become so muddled and hidden that it completely disappears! This can only work on a really small area at a time. The disappeared objects can only be restored if all the scribbling is rubbed off, which can be difficult!"
ability,Pilot,Letters From Your Secret Admirer,3,0,"Pilot spends this action writing a special logo on an adjacent object. The logo looks really silly and juvenile, like Pilot himself. For the rest of combat, he can pull out a paper with the same logo written on it and write a command as a once per round Bonus Action, causing that object to be compelled to perform said action once he activates the sheet by folding it closed as a Main Action. However, Pilot spends way too much time playing around with swirly writing, so he can only put in one word at a time. This means that he’ll have to spend some time to create more complicated commands. If this is used on a person to activate things like Once per Combats, then the usage of that once per combat is not used up. Only one person can have a logo on them at a time in a combat. Bonus Action."
ability,Pilot,Period.,1!,2,"With this, Pilot can add or alter a single instance of punctuation in an ability or effect for the round. This lets him alter how certain things are read and by extension how the effect performs. Often the most effective use of this is to boop little periods in the middle of sentences, although he can do more than that. Once per Round."
ability,Pilot,Footnote,1!,,"Pilot creates a small yellow sticky note with his epithet before writing an adjective on it and attaching it to an adjacent item. This acts as a cast of Descriptive Verbiage, with the adjective affecting what the sticky note is attached to. However, these notes can be removed (and thus destroyed) by yourself as a Free Action, or by anyone else as a contested Move Action or an unrolled Main Action. Once per Round."
weapon,Simone,Dark Side of the Mind: Cognitive Claw,,0,"Channeling her negative thoughts and emotions and manifesting them as a shadow aura overtaking a limb of her choice, Simone lunges to strike. This deals 3 damage, and she can jump one extra space when initiating the attack, effectively giving it 2 range. [RIDBI’S SPECIAL EFFECTS] - Cognitive Claw's damage is increased by 1 (3 to 4), and Simone can choose to reduce gravity's effects on things she attacks with it."
weapon,Simone,Dark Side of the Mind: Psycho Ball,,0,"Simone clasps her hands together, producing a ball of shadow energy within them. By spending her movement action, she can charge this attack, increasing its damage and range by 2 each time that she does."
talent,Simone,Dowsing Rod,,0,"Simone’s mind is attuned to the world around her, giving her advantage on finding hidden objects and locations, as well as always directing her towards underground sources of water."
passive,Simone,Nerve Connection,,1,"Simone’s ESP makes it so she is constantly in control of her mental prowess and her cognition’s impact on reality. With this power, she can imbue the world around her with lines of her psychic energy. Whenever she performs a damaging action, the spaces the action traveled across have a psychokinetic Ley-Line placed upon them. She can have any number of these lines on the field at a given time. - Enemy Contact - If an enemy touches one of these lines, it explodes, dealing 3 damage to the enemy and, if she/they are adjacent to the line in question, allowing Simone or a chosen ally to immediately move up to the enemy and perform a basic attack on them. - Movement Shift Effect - If Simone is standing on a space with a line on it, she gains a once per round anytime that allows her to move anywhere on said line or any connected lines. She must pay 1 stamina to do this, and using this anytime removes the initially used line from the field. - X Formation - If Simone manages to make an “X” pattern using two lines, the lines begin spinning in circles rapidly. While in this state, they no longer collide with enemies, and cannot be used for Simone’s Movement Shift Effect. However, at the start of Simone’s next turn, all enemies standing within the spinning radius of the larger line take damage equivalent to the amount of spaces long the shorter line is. (Prof 35) Mental Fortitude - Once per Combat, Simone can choose a line from Nerve Connection that would normally disappear for whatever reason. The line does not disappear this one time. If Simone desires, she can choose for this effect to happen again (ignoring the OPC restriction), but each time she does, she takes increasing instances of 2 stamina."
ability,Simone,Extrasensory Emission,3,0,"Extending a palm forward, Simone fires a rainbow colored beam in a 1x6 line. Any enemies who are hit by this attack take 5 damage and are sent flying to the end of the beam, as their minds are scanned by Simone’s psychic powers. This causes a property based effect to be returned to Simone, which she can apply to her actions. If the beam hits a line created from her Passive, the properties are instead siphoned into the lines, giving them Passive effects. This also increases the damage the line deals in any attacks it is involved in by 1. (Prof 24) Esper Trailing - Simone can now choose to have Extrasensory Emission bend at any point in its firing. Instead of creating one line via Nerve Connection, this causes the line to split whenever a bend occurs."
ability,Simone,Telekinetic Dream,2!,1,"Simone’s eyes glow a bright blue as she extends a hand towards a target of her choice. This target, which can be herself, begins floating in the air, at the mercy of Simone’s whim. From here, she can choose to either toss something up to 6 spaces away, or take advantage of a grabbed enemy’s position and perform a basic attack of her choice on them. This basic attack does not need to be rolled for. Once per Round. (Prof 33) Phantom Fandango - When holding a unit in place with Telekinetic Dream, Simone can instead have an ally adjacent to her, the unit in question, or one of her lines perform the follow-up basic attack on the unit. Along with this, Telekinetic Dream gains a usage separate from its usual Once per Round that can only be used on Simone’s turn, costs an additional 2 stamina, and is typically reduced in effectiveness. Its Basic Attack Variation has its damage reduced by up to half, and the attack itself must be rolled for."
ability,Simone,Magnet Bomb,3⛯,1,"Extending a finger forward, Simone produces a small, purple ball that follows her finger’s movement while sparking with energy. She then fires the ball as a projectile out anywhere within 4 spaces of her current position, causing it to explode in a cloud of discharged electricity. Once the explosion occurs, all enemies within 7 spaces of it are dragged up to 4 spaces closer to the impact point, taking 1 damage for each space moved. If an enemy is adjacent to the impact point upon the initial explosion, they automatically take 7 damage, and if someone is dragged into the adjacent area, they take an extra point of damage. Once per Combat. (Prof 27) Second Wind - Magnet Bomb is now twice per combat, but costs 4 stamina instead of 3 on the second usage."
weapon,Wesley,Chained Pole Vault,,0,"A bojutsu staff/pole that can extend into dual sided, chain sickles if need be. The pole normally has 2 range and deals 5 damage, but extending it reduces its damage by 1 for each added space of range. Has a maximum of six range. (Prof 23) Deadly Technique - +1 Range (2 to 3). In addition, if extended to its full length, the Chained Pole Vault now inflicts a slight bleed status that Wess can choose to either cause one damage to them at the start of their turns or reduce physical damage they deal by 1 until they get rid of it. (Prof 52) Never Know What Hit ‘Em - Whenever Wess deals damage with Chained Pole Vault, he may pay 1 stamina to have that damage become undodgeable as his pole becomes warped through space-time. The first anytime action taken against it is done so with disadvantage."
talent,Wesley,"Shit, It's The Fuzz!",,0,"Wess doesn’t need time bullshit to know when the cops are on his tail. Whenever someone is specifically targeting/trying to catch him, he essentially has a 50ft spider sense. (Prof 32) Danger Sense - Wess saw a guy do this one. Wess can reduce his “Spider Sense” aura to a mere 10ft, however, he has a +3 to countering, dodging or interfering with anyone specifically targeting him, but a -2 to do those things that are coming from outside of the aura."
talent,Wesley,Millennium Gear,,0,"An incredibly large gear filled to the brim with energy of the chronal variety. Once per Combat, someone touching it may cause their action to speed up by an incredible degree, forcing their next action to both be rolled with advantage due to having more than enough time to correct any simple mistakes they would have. Along with this, reactions to that action have a -3 due to trouble perceiving it correctly. If a character has a Time related resource, however, they may instead Once per Session drain the gear of a vast amount of energy, completely topping off their resource if it has a cap, or giving them 10 if it does not. If this is used the “per combat” effect cannot be triggered during that session, and vice versa."
talent,Wesley,Rowdy Boy,,1,"You may have noticed, but Wess is...well...Wess. And that can be very distracting to others. As a response to an enemy performing an action Wess can Wess it up and perform a non-damaging, 1 cost anytime action to attempt to distract them so long as they are within eyesight and earshot. He can also pull out simple items, like a guitar or soda cans, on his turn. (Prof 40) Movie Buff - Wess is quite the movie boi. When pulling out an item with Rowdy Boi he may pull out a movie prop based on one of the many many movies he has seen in his time. This prop may have some of the functionality of the item in the movie though at a weaker level. He does still have to roll for this, but the roll may be boosted depending on the description of the movie and where the item was used. This has the same usage as his usual item pull, and the GM or even Wess himself may increase the stamina cost to get unique things out."
talent,Wesley,Ragazzi Turbolenti,,2,"Ragazzi Turbolenti - Once per Session, at any time, Wess can start doing a dance as music comes out of nowhere. After one round another Wess shows up and also starts dancing, and one round after that a third Wess joins in on the dance, and finally, the round after that, they can all get to take a full turn at the same time. The only limitation is that they must target different people. They have all of Wess’ current T.E. and the main Wess is the one that takes stamina costs, but they have their own individual ability usages. While they are dancing only the main Wess can actually take actions on their turn and the other ones just follow his movement, engrossed in the dance. (Prof 60) Velocità Ragazzi - One of the other Wess’s appears immediately and starts a dancin’ (This makes it so it takes 3 Rounds to “charge” instead of 4)."
passive,Wesley,Off The Clock,,2,"Wess has a red stat in the form of Temporal Energy that he builds up over time. He has a max of 14, and gains one automatically at the start of his turn. Whenever he deals or takes damage, he also gains half (rounded up) of it as T.E. As an anytime action, he can spend 7 T.E. to perform a minor time skip, canceling the ending of an action and allowing him to immediately follow up with a second action. This combo action is often scaled slightly, dealing less damage, and Wess does not gain any T.E. from combo’d actions. Any enemies adjacent to Wess when he activates this are temporarily slowed down, cutting their next movement in half and making interrupt anytimes harder to initiate until the end of their next turn. (Prof 30) Rad Roman - Once per Combat, Wess may spend only 4 T.E. to perform a minor time skip. Also, the first time he deals damage from a combo action, not only does the damage not get reduced, but he also gains a quarter of the damage rounded up as T.E., Once per T.E. combo. (Prof 60) After Hours - Wess is becoming more creative with his epithet and is now coming up with new ways to use all that Temporal Energy he is building up. The usage for the T.E. he has follows the same rules as with “Off The Clock” with the exception of it not being considered an anytime but still being able to be used on his own turn or not, there is no limit to how many times he may do this per round or turn so long as he has the T.E. and it isn’t stated otherwise. The new usages are as follows; - Now In 3-D (4 T.E.) - Wess may take an action that he is performing and split it into 2 halves, one Red and one Blue, these halves are weakened to half of their power (rounding up). Wess can strain his epithet to slightly stretch how these halves work, but each must be done so in different ways. This may increase stamina costs slightly. If he does this as a part of an “Off The Clock” action, the entire thing may be affected by this.  - You’re Slower Than I Expected (7 T.E.) - Wess may make a basic attack and inflict 1d2 “Slow” to a unit that is not afflicted with it already. Once per Turn. - I Don’t Gotta Make Fancy Names For All Of These Right? (4 T.E.) - Wess can take a Movement Action. - I Do? Well Damn….Alright. (4 T.E.) - Wess can take an additional Bonus Action. - Ey! I’m Going Again! (7 T.E.) - Wess can use an Anytime Action without taking up its Once per Round usage. - Peace Sign! (X T.E.) - Wess can spend as much T.E. as he likes up to his current total to smile and give a peace sign to grant himself a multitude of buffs, the memories of his mother and his own determination coming through to give him inner strength.This can grant him a +1 to rolls, crit range, and movement (each increased separately) for each T.E. he spends up to a maximum of 4 for 1 round, which can also be increased by 1 for every 2 T.E. he spends. - This Is Gonna Be Useful! (14 T.E.) - Permanently increase the total T.E. that Wess can store for the rest of the session by 7."
ability,Wesley,"Thanks, Einstein",3!,2,"As we all know, time is relative. It’s often hard to perceive two events happening at the same time. Using this to his advantage, Wess messes with the time stream to cause an event from the past or future to happen simultaneously with another one. This often causes a change in the interrupted event. Once per Round. (Prof 43) Applied Relativity -  “Thanks, Einstein” can now be used easier on things that are close enough to what Wess has immediately available to him (e.g. having seen a door open can be used to potentially open nearly any door like a vault door or a car door or even flipping a coin could allow him to flip a table, though that might incur additional stamina costs)."
ability,Wesley,With Relative Ease,2,0,"Everything’s different from every person’s point of view. Due to this, Wess can morph the size of something based on how he currently sees it. He can then reposition the changed object to a location (on the battlefield) of his choice. (Prof 37) Ease Indeed - The stamina cost of this ability is reduced from 3 to 2."
ability,Wesley,Backlog Overflow,X⛯,1,"As a Bonus Action on his turn, Wess can store a chosen action in the Temporal Energy flowing around him. This is often indicated by him spinning his pole around in a very rapid fashion. Then, when he desires, he can let all of these actions out at once. For each turn of non-ability actions built up, he pays 1 stamina and all abilities cost their standard amount. Once per Combat. (Prof 58) Action Overflow - Backlog Overflow can now be used as a free action to store a basic attack action on Wess’ turn, once per turn. It still otherwise retains its Bonus Action usage."
ability,Wesley,Hey! Check This Out!,2,1,"Wess finger guns at the nearest ally he likes or, alternatively, a middle finger to the nearest enemy he does not like. He then proceeds to dash up to 5 spaces and pole vault into the air, performing a trick of his choice while airborne, which may or may not add a minor extra effect to the dropkick he lands into an enemy’s face for 6 damage and 1-2 knockback. (Prof 49) Hey! Check THAT Out! - When using “Hey! Check This Out!”, Wess now leaves a space-time echo of himself in his original position. For the time it is around, Wess can not only use its position for anything that requires positional relativity but he can also, as a 1 cost anytime, return to its position, erasing it but moving him out of danger. He must pay 1 upkeep at the start of his turns to keep it around. He may only have one ST-Echo out at a time."
ability,Wesley,Too Slow!,3⛯,1,"Wess smirks before jabbing a hand into an adjacent opponent. This causes temporal energy to swirl around inside of them, slowing their movements to a crawl. They are now inflicted with a “Slowed” Status, which lasts 1d3+1 rounds. From here, the molecules around them move so slowly that the unit takes 2 ice damage at the start of their turns, and their vision is reduced immensely, reducing all their ranges to 2, but this starts to return to normal by 1 at the start of their turns until the status is gone. Also, their movement and results of all rolls are reduced by the amount of rounds the status has left remaining. Similarly, they take that much extra damage whenever they are attacked, as the attack feels longer to them. Once per Combat."
ability,Wesley,I Saw This In A Movie Once,X,0,"Wess is able to channel the power of his epithet with “he has seen a lot of movies” to recreate a classic scene from one of those movies, with his epithet assisting him and producing simple yet functional props for him to use. Usually they’d be from an action movie, but pretty much anything goes so long as it is from a movie and Wess says a cool one-liner to go with it. Stamina Cost is determined by the GM, but they may reduce or increase it depending on how cool the one-liner is. This can be used in conjunction with Rowdy Boi to boost the effectiveness or even create crossovers with different movie props."
weapon,Kazuma,Thousand Shoves,,0,"Kazuma solidifies his stance before unleashing one of two different shoving techniques. Either: - He unleashes a flurry of slaps, dealing 6 damage as the target is forced to endure the barrage. - He puts all his strength into one giant push, dealing 3 damage and pushing the target backwards 3-4 spaces."
talent,Kazuma,Super Duper Sumos for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance,,0,"Kazuma, despite what you may think, is actually quite a big gamer. As such, he always has a Nintendo GameBoy Advance SP on him at all times."
talent,Kazuma,Earthbound Pillar,,0,"If Kazuma does not use his movement action during his turn, he enters a traditional “Sumo Stance”: with outward-extended legs and hands on his knees. As this occurs, Kazuma begins to heat up, expelling steam as his position is solidified. While this stance is active, it is significantly more difficult to inflict knockback/prone effects upon him. The next action Kazuma performs after activating the stance becomes a Burning Action, granting the action extra fire based effects/damage."
talent,Kazuma,Purifying Salts,,0,"As per sumo tradition, Kazuma carries salt around with him to purify the battlefield and others around him. He can, as a Bonus Action, throw salt at a unit/space within 3 of his current location, which can clear negative status effects or ongoing/environmental effects the salt makes contact with, as Kazuma uses his Epithet to bolster the presence of the salt. Along with this, when placing down the ring produced from The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall, Kazuma can pay 1 stamina to spread this salt across the area the ring covers (which is unrolled)."
passive,Kazuma,"The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall",,0,"Every time Kazuma engages in combat, it somehow morphs into a sumo match. Due to this, a red circle appears on the ground around Kazuma at all times, acting as a 3 space (15 ft aura). Once he attacks a target, he can choose for the circle to lock to the ground, and if anyone steps out from inside of it (or is pushed out), they take 3-6 damage. Similarly, any attacks initiated from someone inside the circle has the chance to knock someone else inside the circle down, dealing additional damage if any part of their body aside from their feet touches the ground. Of course, Kazuma can also be knocked down and/or pushed, but it’s relatively hard to do so. If he desires, he can also spend 1 stamina to transform the circle back into an aura as a Bonus Action, but he cannot replace the ring in the same turn. (Prof 27) Gentleman of Strength - Any of Kazuma’s actions that he makes inside of the ring automatically become “Rikishi Actions”. Rikishi actions are significantly harder to directly counter, take head-on or stop unless another Rikishi Action is being used against it. Anyone else inside of Kazuma’s ring may convert an action they are taking into a Rikishi Action so long as they pay 1 extra stamina and it mostly conforms to the honorable way of the sumo."
ability,Kazuma,"I Like Them Big, I Like Them Chunky",2!,1,"With an intense stare, Kazuma begins marching over to a chosen target. He intercepts any attacks along the way, taking reduced damage as he is unphased movement wise. Once he reaches the target, he can immediately perform a singular push on them. Once per Round. (Prof 30) Power Through - When Kazuma tanks through an attack(s) using “I Like Them Big, I Like Them Chunky”, his Epithet produces a Mawashi that has absorbed energy from said attack(s). From there, Kazuma gains access to a one-use ability that takes the form of a sumo wrestling technique with properties of the attack that formed that particular Mawashi. This ability can be carried between Combats and Sessions, and if it is used to knock out a unit, it becomes a “Kimarite Ability” that Kazuma keeps permanently."
ability,Kazuma,The Girthquake,3,0,"Kazuma performs the signature sumo stomp, cracking the earth in either a 4 space straight line or in a radius affecting all spaces adjacent to him. Anyone hit by this takes 3-7 damage and is instantly knocked Prone. (Prof 16) Controlled Girth - The Girthquake no longer has friendly fire, and has its minimum damage increased to 5 (from 3)."
ability,Kazuma,Folding Space,2!,1,"Kazuma claps and a set of traditional japanese folding screens appears in an area of his choice. These can either increase the “thickness” of the space between two objects, making them further apart and reducing the effectiveness of attacks launched within that space, or open up in the path of an attack/action, increasing the “thickness” of objects that pass through in order to increase their size and/or damage. Once per Round. (Prof 22) Rosewood Paneling - When creating the folding screen using Folding Space, Kazuma can choose whether it has 2, 4, or 6 panels that make it up. Making it with 2 may make it slightly weaker but gives it anytime priority and harder to counter. Making it with 4 is the same as normal. Making it with 6 may make it a lot more effective but easier to counter."
ability,Kazuma,Makushita Division,X,0,"Kazuma sticks his hands outward, producing an Epithetical, red wall that takes up to a XxX area (Each dimension can only be up to a maximum of 5) (Cost is equal to half of the size of the largest dimension rounding up). This wall acts as a barrier/shield, making it so that enemies and enemy attacks cannot pass through it easily if at all. This wall remains on the battlefield until destroyed or dismissed, and if Kazuma is adjacent to it, it is typically more effective as he uses his strength to fortify it. If he desires, he can produce a wall up to 3 spaces away from him, facing in any direction, but in this case its maximum size is reduced. This ability can be used as a Bonus Action, but if it is, the wall only lasts until the end of Kazuma's tur"

talent,Carnation,CURRENT_OBJECTIVE,,0,"As he’ll be sure to remind you, Carnation’s objective is to eliminate the workers of DBA who betrayed him and his siblings. Therefore, he deals 1.5 damage to anyone who is an active worker at DBA and also anything DBA owns."
talent,Carnation,Binary_Beatdown.exe,,0,"If Carnation successfully attacks a target, he may mark them as a “1”, at the end of combat he receives stamina equal to one third of the targets marked with this rounding up, to a maximum of 5 (being a powerhouse does not change this amount)."
passive,Carnation,Back With A Vengeance,,0,"Carnation’s origins as a balancing robot makes it so he is connected to a constantly fluctuating power system. However, since he defected, he has managed to reprogram this balance program in order to assist him and him alone. With this, the worse Carnation and his team are doing compared to the enemy(s), the stronger he becomes. Since his damage and movement boost(s) are tied to how behind his team is, the extent of this passive’s boost is therefore determined by the GM. This effect cannot impact Carnation negatively due to how he has reprogrammed his functions."
passive,Carnation,Extended Warranty,,0,"While Carnation was designed to decent specifications, this will now come back to haunt his creators, as he will not be defeated by the corroding hands of time. When hit by a status effect it will always end a maximum of two rounds after he received it."
ability,Carnation,Metallic Madness,3,0,"After some loud beeping and buzzing, Carnation sticks his arms into the ground and a large, steel wire shoots out of the ground in an area of his choosing. From there, it can either latch onto a nearby unit or object and grapple them or transform into a metal structure of Carnation’s choice. These wires can be exploded as an anytime action. (Prof 16) Link Cable - If Carnation uses Metallic Madness on a willing target, he does not need to tie them down, merely connect to them. While connected to them, he may trade abilities with them. Each target must give an ability so that the total amount of techniques they have access to does not change. Carnation may not get rid of Metallic Madness with this. When the cord is severed, all abilities return to their original owner."
ability,Carnation,Cringe Before Carnation,1!,0,"After someone fails an action, Carnation can analyze their weakness in order to discover how to kill them easier. With each of his scans, Carnation gains a +1 to damage dealt against the scanned unit. Upon reaching three scans on one unit, Carnation is able to create a new ability specifically designed to eliminate said target. He keeps this for the rest of combat, and it only takes a single scan to regain this ability in future combats. Once per round. (Prof 8) Enhanced Scanning - Cringe Before Carnation is now twice per round, as long as each use is on separate people. [RIDBI’S STYLISH LESSON] - When using Cringe Before Carnation, if Carnation rolls the same number as the person he is scanning, the ability automatically succeeds and gives Carnation +2 damage against them instead of +1."
ability,Carnation,Retribution Ray,3⛯,1,"Carnation reels back as a panel opens up on his chest, revealing a glowing power core inside of him. After a moment of charging, he fires a massive lazer that consists of light, fire, or electricity. It deals 8-15 damage and has the chance of inflicting statuses based on which element the lazer is composed of. If Carnation desires, he can maintain the lazer fire over the duration of a round, as well as change its direction at the start of his next turn so long as he pays an extra 2 stamina. Once per Combat."
ability,Carnation,Electric Overclock,3⛯,0,"Upkeep Ability. Carnation’s power core is incredibly useful, but sometimes it does not give as much power as he would need. With this he can set himself into overclocked mode where he gains an additional move action per turn and bonus electric damage to his attacks. At the start of his turn, when Carnation pays the 1 upkeep, a bolt of electricity will arc up to 3 spaces to hit the nearest enemy for 3 damage as an unrolled free action. Once per Combat."
weapon,Beowulf,Susan The Spiteful,,0,"3 damage 1 range. Beowulf’s first sword, gained after he was rejected on the elementary school playground. Due to when he got this sword, it is a bit on the shorter side, not unlike Susan’s patience regarding Beowulf. As it was forged from a playground incident, Beowulf can use this in the middle of a move action. It gains advantage when he uses it to hit a dodgeball."
weapon,Beowulf,Blair The Bitch Witch,,0,"5 damage 1 range. Created after Beowulf attempted to attain the elusive “big tiddy goth gf”, this sword contains a dark power. This is partially due to the fact that Beowulf made its hilt black to remind him of who inspired it, and partially due to Blair cursing it once she saw Beowulf the second time. It inflicts a curse status on rolls 15 or higher, causing a unit to take 1d4 damage at the start of their turns for 1d3+1 turns. However, every third time Beowulf uses this sword, he is automatically inflicted with the curse, regardless of whether his attack was successful."
weapon,Beowulf,Penelope The Projectile Haver,,0,"2 damage 5 range.When Beowulf first tried hitting on this girl, she threw everything in the nearby vicinity at him, which was quite rude. This memory stuck with him, and thus this sword is used as a projectile. Pushes hit targets back 2 or more spaces once they are hit."
weapon,Beowulf,Buster The Bro,,0,"7 damage 2 range. After being rejected so many times, Beowulf figured that dudes may be more of his forte. They weren’t. This is a huge ass buster sword with cleaving properties. However, whenever Beowulf uses this sword, his next movement action is halved. (Prof 12) Better Blacksmith - +1 damage and range to Buster the Bro (7 to 8 and 2 to 3)."
weapon,Beowulf,Gnatasha The Gnarly,,0,"5 damage 1 range. There was this one surfer chick that both rejected Beowulf and showed him up in a contest of who can literally jump the shark. This experience led to Beowulf taking one of the shark’s teeth that found its way into his shoulder to make a new sword. Due to its shape, it not only has piercing properties, but also has a tendency to get stuck into people. Essentially, this allows Beowulf to grapple, forcing targets to make a check to escape on their turn (I mean, unless they want to stay firmly shish-kebabed). Each round a target is continuously grappled, they take 2 damage."
weapon,Beowulf,Jade The Joker,,0,"1 damage 1 range. Beowulf was feeling very lonely and/or desperate, and tried hitting on a birthday clown. All this led to was sadness and a balloon poodle. Beowulf then reassembled the poodle into a sword and began using it as one of his many. Despite it being a balloon, he has practiced with it enough to allow him to deal 1 damage with it as a melee weapon. Plus, hitting with it either inflicts wild magic or allows Beowulf to follow up with a small, clown related bonus action. (Prof 12) Better Blacksmith - +1 damage and range to Jade the Joker (1 to 2 and 1 to 2)."
weapon,Beowulf,Echo The Elusive,,0,"This gal may have assumed Beowulf’s likeness, but definitely not to the point where she liked him. Green never was Beowulf’s favorite color anyways. Beowulf is able to model this sword off of one of his fellow party members, with its stats, effects, and appearance dependent on his choice. It’s always green though."
weapon,Beowulf,Wren The Wretched,,0,"5 damage 3 range. This lady’s pretty old, but thankfully, Echo made sure to check in to see my chances. I’ve been hearing some pretty weird things about this lady though. Apparently, I may be walking on thin fucking ice. This sword is covered in golden leaves along with a similar golden trim, and a deep black hilt. Upon hitting an initial target, Beowulf can have some of the leaves fire off it, hitting an adjacent unit for 4 damage. This can be done one more time, requiring another roll, and dealing 3 damage to this final unit in the chain."
weapon,Beowulf,Jack-O'-Lantern The Jovial,,0,"4 damage 2 range. Looks like the only thing that’s a ghost this Halloween is Beowulf’s happiness. This sword has a jack-o’-lantern on the bottom of its hilt, with the rest of the hilt being made of a similarly orange material with vines wrapped all around it. The end of the blade has the signature curvature of a scythe. The Jack-o’-Lantern at the hilt has two faces, one representing fire and one representing ice. Every time Beowulf uses the sword, the current face’s corresponding element becomes strengthened. Eventually, Beowulf may even be able to cast magic spells from the sword based in said element. However, if Beowulf ever fails an action using this sword, the face automatically switches, reverting Beowulf’s elemental control back to base."
weapon,Beowulf,Felfra The Fallen,,0,"4 damage 1 range, or 1 damage 4 range. Damn bro, your girlfriend is the moon? I thought the moon WAS an old lady and is NOW a Katamari, but like…that’s rough. Combining two edgy themings into one, this sword is a cutlass-style gunblade with the “blade” fashioned into a glimmering angel wing, and the “gun” being present near the blackened hilt which transitions into a red, demon wing barrel. The blade has a maximum of 6 bullets loaded into it, and whenever Beowulf successfully attacks with the melee version of this weapon, he can pay 1 Stamina to immediately fire a shot. The shots deal fire damage, and if hitting an adjacent unit, they explode for 3 damage instead of their standard 1, also dealing up to 3 knockback. Additionally, if the most recent sword Beowulf used was Felfra the Fallen, he can use a once per round anytime to fire a shot! This also costs 1 Stamina, and does not explode when hitting adjacent units. If Beowulf wants to reload with this weapon, he needs to use a Main Action."
passive,Beowulf,Super Cool Ultra Secret Technique #7: Beowulf the Wondrous and His Ultimate Blade Barrage,,1,"Upon using all of his swords at least once, Beowulf gains access to his trump card. This Passive becomes a 7 cost ability that covers a 7x7 area with Beowulf at its center. The allotted area shines a bright gold as Beowulf’s swords fly out of their sheaths and are suspended in midair. From there, Beowulf disappears for a moment before apparating by each of his swords and performing a series of sweeping slashes across the area. Finally, he zooms high into the sky as he becomes his own final sword: Beowulf the Bastard, reflecting his never ending quest for validation as he divekicks back down. This deals around 10-17 damage to all enemies within the area and inflicts all sword effects without the downsides for Beowulf himself. Upon using this, Beowulf’s sword uses are considered to be back at zero, requiring him to use all of them once again if he wants to use this ability. Sword usage is not carried between combats."
ability,Beowulf,The Helicopter Chopper,2,1,"Beowulf spins one of his swords all quick-like. He can use this to create a sword buzzsaw that deals sword damage +4 and can be maintained over the course of a round, a quick spin slash that hits all adjacent units (or more depending on the sword) for sword damage +2, or as makeshift helicopter blades that Beowulf can use to fly."
ability,Beowulf,A Dashing Maneuver for a Dashing Fellow,2!,1,"Unsheathing one of his swords in an instant, Beowulf dashes up to 4 spaces in any direction of his choosing. This shields him from incoming attacks, and he can choose to either lead with his swords to deal their normal damage to a hit target, or to instead quickly grab a target before pulling them into a brutal backstab. The latter deals an extra 5 damage and halves a unit’s next Movement Action, but is generally harder to land in regards to the counterattack. Once per round. (Prof 8) Backstab Brutality - When Beowulf uses the backstab version of ‘Dashing Maneuver For A Dashing Fellow’, it will now always deal 5 (increased from 2-3) additional damage and halve the chosen target’s movement (as opposed to having a chance to simply reduce)."
ability,Beowulf,Storm of Swords,4⛯,1,"Beowulf quickly flicks his fingers across three of his swords before a black blur overtakes a 2x4 area in front of him. Colored slashes representing each of the swords he picked cut wildly through the cloud, revealing the latest victims of this sick move. This deals the damage of the 3 swords combined, and potentially even more to everyone within the area while also inflicting each of the swords’ effects. Once per Combat."
ability,Beowulf,The…Ssssssss...Forgemaster,1,0,"That sound was Beowulf inhaling sharply through his teeth, not the sound of the bellows on his portable blacksmith’s forge blowing, but that does also happen. Beowulf chooses one of his swords and also takes one of the weapons of an adjacent ally, placing them intimately close to each other on his anvil. Scootch just a little closer, you two. Yeeeaah. That’s the stuff. He then gets to work with his hammer, enhancing his chosen sword with one property of the weapon, and vice versa. It could be a specific effect, or just a little bit of extra damage. This counts as using the chosen sword for Technique #7. If any enemies are adjacent to Beowulf when he uses this, they take minor fire damage as the sparks fly. Note that he can grab a weapon from an ally during his movement and then continue moving before fully using this ability. The ally gets the weapon back immediately no matter what. These additional effects last for the rest of the session by default, but if he uses the same enhancement repeatedly in the same session, they can become much more permanent at the GM’s discretion. Once per Two Rounds, he can use this as a Bonus Action."
weapon,Cosmo,Ignition Riot,,0,"One of Cosmo’s limbs begins burning bright, smoke expelling off of it. Then, in an instant, he bursts forward with an attack of explosive proportions. Cosmo can choose to have this attack carry him, and anyone it may hit, up to 4 spaces in any direction. 7 damage 1 range."
weapon,Cosmo,Popgun Dynamite,,0,"Cosmo pulls out his trusty popgun, and upon firing it, 4 Epithet based bottle rockets come soaring out. These rockets can be individually directed at anyone on the field, with each rocket dealing 1 damage. Infinite range. (Prof 84) Free-Flying Rockets - Popgun Dynamite is now always a Bonus Action to use. Along with this, Cosmo can choose to have any of the bottle rockets created from it stay suspended in empty spaces of his choice. When an enemy collides with one of these bottle rockets, they take 2 damage and are inflicted with minor knockback. This enables follow-up attacks combo’d after one of these hits to roll with advantage. If Cosmo chooses to set up any of the initially created bottle rockets this way, he gains one extra bottle rocket to place as he pleases."
weapon,Cosmo,Symbol of Spirit,,1,"6 damage 3 range. Cosmo’s Golden Artifact, a weapon granted to him via his connection to Clay Granton. Symbol of Spirit is a massive golden flagpole, with its respective flag featuring a stylized rendition of Planet Earth with a rocket orbiting it. This weapon’s attacks remove DR from those it hits. As a movement or main action, Cosmo can set the flag down into a chosen object or surface, and doing so causes it to produce a 10 ft aura from itself. While in this state, all allies within the aura and Cosmo (regardless of whether or not he is in the aura) are able to incorporate properties and/or powers of whatever the flagpole is currently in into their actions. Along with this, he can use Symbol of Spirit to simply produce normal flagpoles anywhere adjacent to him."
talent,Cosmo,Zero Gravity,,0,"Cosmo is immune to gravitational based effects, and is able to jump way higher than most people. He similarly has no issue maneuvering himself in the air."
talent,Cosmo,Space Race,,0,"Due to his Epithet’s influence over his genetic make-up, Cosmo’s movement is increased by 2 and he is able to fly."
talent,Cosmo,To Infinity And Beyond,,0,"Whenever Cosmo or one of his allies critically succeed on a Natural 20, their next roll has advantage."
talent,Cosmo,The Dog Talisman,,1,"A small stone talisman that can fit in your hand. Once per Session, for the length of 2 rounds, the user can activate this by spending 5 max stamina at anytime speed. When activated the user can no longer be knocked through stamina costs, damage, or other methods. They cannot die and their souls cannot be touched, damaged or hurt through any method. In addition they fast heal for 3 at the start of their turns."
passive,Cosmo,Mustistage Jettison,,1,"As Cosmo uses up his stamina in a battle, he reduces his overall mass to power himself up. Upon reaching half of his max stamina, an epithet engine is expelled out of his body. This increases his damage by 2 and his movement by 3, and allows him to utilize the engine in his abilities by paying 1 stamina. Upon reaching ⅙ of his health, his damage is increased by 4 and his movement by 6, and he gains a second engine to utilize. Each engine can be used once per round. Healing Cosmo does not revert forms gained from this Passive."
passive,Cosmo,Stardust Crusaders,,2,"A voyage to the stars isn’t complete without a crew. At the start of combat, Cosmo summons two Stardust Crusaders: Epithet energy funneled into the form of astronaut suits. They each have 11 stamina, a 5 damage Moonsault melee attack, a 3 damage 4 range Moonblast, and can use one of Cosmo’s abilities, which Cosmo can choose for each upon their summoning. Both cannot have the same ability, and the cost of all abilities are increased by 1. Similarly, they and Cosmo all share Blast Off Supernova’s Once per Combat usage. If the Stardust Crusaders are adjacent to Cosmo as he moves, they can hitch a ride and move along with him. Finally, while adjacent to Cosmo, they can use a full turn to try and heal Cosmo for 3-5 stamina."
ability,Cosmo,Reach For The Stars,X,0,"Cosmo points up towards the sky, calling upon the power of the stars. He can choose a constellation and produce an effect based on it, with stamina cost dependent on the severity. Engine Variant - This augments Cosmo’s basic weapons upon use of the ability, adding a secondary effect based on the constellation to the next successful use of one of them."
ability,Cosmo,Blast Off Supernova,3⛯,1,"With a snap, Cosmo produces a 3x3 rocket in an area of his choice. It immediately prepares for lift off, rumbling in its place. Anyone the rocket spawns on takes 3 damage immediately, and is shunted to the edge of its area. Upon summoning, and at the start of each unit’s turn, all enemies standing adjacent to the rocket take 1 damage. The rocket then gives Cosmo a bonus to his rolls, starting at +3 and being reduced by one until three rounds have passed. At this point, the rocket lifts off, dealing 5 damage to anyone adjacent to it and zooming into the sky. From this point, a 5x5 area of Cosmo’s choice is shrouded in shadow as the rocket crashes down and deals 30 damage to anyone standing inside. It is fairly difficult to avoid/block this crash landing once it has been initiated. Only one rocket can be on the field at a time. Once per Combat, unless the rocket is destroyed before it lifts off. Engine Variant - The engine causes the rocket to become multi staged. Upon it crashing onto the arena, the arena suffers 3 rounds of flaming debris rain that enemies must roll a check to avoid. This completely uses up the engine."
ability,Cosmo,Ionic Wasteland,3,0,"Cosmo funnels his hands together before sending out a massive, pressurized blast. This takes up a 5x3 space line, deals 5-7 damage to everyone it hits, propels Cosmo up to 3 spaces backward, and transforms the afflicted area into an Irradiated Zone. This zone deals 2 damage (to enemies) upon entry, and at the start of an enemy’s turn inside of it, with the latter instance having a chance of afflicting them with an irradiated status, increasing the stamina cost of all of their abilities by 1 for a round. Engine Variant - Using an engine bolsters Cosmo’s power, allowing him to take up to 6 spaces of movement after using this ability. Along with this, Irradiated Zones now always inflict the Irradiated status at the start of an enemy’s turns inside of them, and have a chance of inflicting a stack upon an enemy’s entry into them."
ability,Cosmo,Full Throttle Blitz,1!,1,"Cosmo’s feet expel a large amount of smoke as a cone of fire envelops his body. He can dash up to 3 spaces up to 3 times, and deals 1 fire damage each time he dashes into/through someone. Rolling a 15 or higher inflicts a hit target with a burn status. Once per round. Engine Variant - If Cosmo utilizes his engine, his dashes instead become a single, powerful strike. Doing so allows him to dash up to 6 spaces forward, causes 5-6 damage on contact, and also causes all hit units to be knocked prone. Along with the typical effects of being prone, this also allows Cosmo or an adjacent ally to perform a follow-up attack on the affected unit at reduced effectiveness."
ability,Cosmo,Sputnik Satellaview,3,0,"Out from Cosmo’s body come 1-3 satellites placed in spaces of his choice within 5 spaces of him. These satellites have 6 stamina and a 2 damage 2 range projectile laser that automatically fires upon any enemies that come in range of them. If Cosmo or an ally targets one of the satellites with one of their attacks, all damage that they would have taken is instead transferred into their next laser blast. After using this ability, it cannot be used again until all satellites created from the previous use are destroyed. Engine Variant - Cosmo gives one of the satellites an engine, giving it 4 movement that can be used either on Cosmo’s turn and/or as a 1 stamina, once per round anytime action."
ability,Cosmo,"To The Moon, Your Highness",2,0,"Using this ability is a Swift Action. A glint shines off of Cosmo’s eyes as his right arm begins glowing an incredibly bright orange-white. He then dashes up to 3 spaces in any direction before delivering a massive inferno of an uppercut to an adjacent unit. This deals 3 damage, knocks them skyward, and, if Cosmo wants, he can choose to travel with the unit up into the air. Engine Variant - Upon using an engine, this ability’s uppercut now produces star-like sparks in a 3x3 area centered on Cosmo. As a 1 cost anytime action, Cosmo can have these sparks explode, dealing 3-4 damage and inflicting high knockback."
ability,Cosmo,Hubble Bubble,0!,0,"Cosmo snaps, as a flare of energy produced by his Epithet flies into/as close to space as possible. Upon reaching its destination, the flare expands into a massive, satellite-telescope structure that locks its sights down onto the combat arena. Cosmo can designate a 3x3 area of his choice, and after doing so, the telescope absorbs the energy of all units/ongoing effects in said area. Whenever an action or effect occurs within the area, said action/effect is stored within the telescope’s databanks. Then, as a Bonus Action on his turn, Cosmo can choose to have the telescope transfer its data to him as it goes offline. At this point, Cosmo can create a new ability combining aspects of all of the things that were observed, and he keeps this ability for the rest of combat. The stamina costs for these abilities are typically fairly high, and often dependent on the actions/effects being incorporated. After all of this occurs, Hubble Bubble has a 1-2 round cooldown before being able to be used again. Engine Variant - The area created by Hubble Bubble is now a 4x4, and always has only a 1 round cooldown. Along with this, upon activation, Cosmo can choose one action that has occurred within the last round to immediately add to the telescope’s databanks."
weapon,Ifuku,Glorious Nippon Steel,,0,"7 damage 1 range. Nothing like the classics. Due to the fact that Ifuku only has one arm to guide her blade, and thus her attacking trajectories are more limited, dodge anytimes have a +3 against this attack. However, that’s only for the first time they dodge, as Ifuku gauges their reaction speed."
talent,Ifuku,Another Brush With Death,,0,"Seeing as how being terribly wounded is how Ifuku unlocked incredible power, it happening again is really cooking with gas. Whenever she would end combat with one fourth or lower her Max Stamina, you gain 3 Proficiency and gain another round of your left eye being open (as per Third Eye Open) per combat."
talent,Ifuku,Wandering Samurai,,0,Ifuku gains +1 Movement Speed.
talent,Ifuku,Counter Focused Strategy,,0,"If Ifuku makes a counterattack (either by holding her Main Action to attack when you would be damaged or via some other means), she is treated as rolling a minimum 7 on her attack roll and deals +2 damage. Critical Hits dealt via counter-attacks grant +1 more Proficiency than normal. Any defenses she would’ve used must still be rolled as normal since that’s not the focus of the Miru Style. If she takes no damage from an attack she is countering due to outside “help”, this talent is irrelevant."
passive,Ifuku,Third Eye Blind,,0,"During her close encounter with death, in which she lost her arm, Ifuku’s spirit awakened to its true potential. Her body, however, hasn’t caught up. So instead of enhancing her physicality directly, Ifuku’s spiritual energies influence the next best thing: her clothes. Ifuku’s clothes are connected to her Mindscape, allowing her to store physical things within it as “concepts” which she can then withdraw as a Free Action on her turn. As long as she could fit it into her clothes, there is no limit to what she can fit within it. Now, given, you might need to strip for a bit to fit larger things with a larger surface area, but still. If, for whatever reason, Ifuku isn’t wearing her normal clothes, she must take a Main Action to connect what she is currently wearing to her Mindscape. However, she will not be able to access the things she had stored in your kimono unless expressly stated from an ability."
ability,Ifuku,Needs More Gunpowder,X,0,"Ifuku may withdraw any kind of weapon from within the folds of her clothing as a Free Action with the cost being depending on the range and damage she’s going for. She can only have one of these weapons out at a time, because you know, she can only hold one thing at a time and this shit’s too expensive to just hand out."
ability,Ifuku,Third Eye Open,1,1,"By taking off her eyepatch, Ifuku can reveal her psychokinetic awakening with a brilliant, burning red energy flowing from her scarred retina. Ifuku chooses one living target that she can see. While this eye is open, she deals an additional 2 damage to them and has a +3 on rolls against them. Obstructions/illusions do not inhibit this effect. Maintaining this effect has Upkeep 1, and it has a maximum of 5 Rounds that it can be active per combat. These rounds do not need to be consecutive or against the same target. Bonus Action. (Prof 27) The Eye of Death - By expending an additional round of her “per combat” limit of Third Eye Open (either when activating it or paying upkeep), Ifuku can increase its buff by +2 more damage or increase her critical threat range by one. She can stack this effect twice per instance of a round."
ability,Ifuku,Psycho-Barrier,1!,1,"Since most of Ifuku’s power resides in her clothes, projecting a layer of energy similar to clothing is fairly easy and useful for reducing damage. Generally reduces by 6 on a high success, and is doubly effective at blocking bludgeoning/psychic damage. Once per Round."
ability,Ifuku,Conceptual Overlay,2,0,"Whenever Ifuku would withdraw something from her Mindscape, she may give the item being taken out additional properties based on anything else she currently have stored within her clothes. However, this only applies while Ifuku is holding onto it, and she cannot use the other item until the first is put back inside. If the item is broken the conceptual second is lost forever. This ability is unrolled, unless it would be applied to another ability, in which case it uses the same roll. It must be declared that she’s using this before rolling in such a case. A Proficiency granting 20 grants +1 Proficiency, as opposed to counting as ‘a prof granting crit twice’. Free Action."
weapon,Magano,NXTGeneration,,0,"4 damage 1 range. Magano’s sword, modeled after the katana “Big Bang”, is a long and thin single edged katana. The hilt is black with hints of green, and the blade is all green with hints of black. As her sword is actually a part of her body she doesn’t necessarily need to use her hands to swing it, it can be from any part of her body. Magano can spend 1 stamina while swinging it to reduce the damage to 2 while allowing it to be swung in a three space wide cleave arc."
weapon,Magano,Green Flame Assault,,1,Magano punches someone with such force that flames wrap around them. These flames purify and actually heal the target for 4 stamina at 1 range. (Prof 20) Phoenixian Flame - Green Flame Assault now ‘inflicts’ 1d3 Fast Healing for 3 rounds on rolls of 14+. This is not generally considered a negative status effect and therefore does not grant units a resist roll.
talent,Magano,More Monstrous Than A Dream Should Be,,1,"Magano is able to stretch and reform her body in various ways, much like a certain shounen protag who has the properties of both rubber and pirate. She can extend her limbs up to 3 extra spaces, or 6 extra spaces if she spends 1 stamina for each extra space extended. Stretching her limbs allows her to be adjacent to a target from a distance. She also gains the ability to temporarily expand herself to a 3x3 size for an instant, reflecting any blunt attack or blunt projectile back at the attacker as a once per round 1 cost anytime."
talent,Magano,131.1 The Fear,,0,Magano’s always listening to her favorite radio station and this zen allows her to ride on walls and over gaps with her “rollerblades''. They look so stylish and cool and they also grant her an extra 2 Movement.
passive,Magano,Anomalous Healer,,0,"Magano is an odd case. Despite all of her combat capabilities, she’s actually an exceptional healer. For reasons unbeknownst to anyone but herself, whenever Magano deals damage, all of it is converted to healing and conversely all of her healing is converted to damage. This means that her damage can only be reduced or increased by affecting her healing and vice versa."
passive,Magano,Nightmare Eater,,1,"Magano is able to passively sense people’s fears and anxieties through their nightmares. And although she is a good person(?) deep down, she sure does love the taste of nightmares. This does have a benefit however, and as a Bonus Action on her turn Magano can eat the nightmare of an adjacent target. This not only allows her to apply effects to her own kit based on the target’s fears and nightmares for a round, but also removes that fear or nightmare from the target for that round. For allies, this means that they become more clear headed and focused, this allows them to give themselves advantage on a single roll and a +4 to another roll in the next 2 rounds. For enemies, this means they become more reckless and antsy, and this allows Magano and her allies to give that enemy disadvantage on a single roll and also to make it so that a single one of their attacks (Magano and her ally’s choice) deals half the damage they dealt back to them in the next 2 rounds. This passive can not be used on the same target for 2 rounds after it has been used once. [DYLAXAPHI] Dark Evolution: Dream Sustenance - Consuming nightmares, wouldn’t you know it, is quite filling for Living Dreams like Magano. After eating a nightmare, Magano is able to heal from it! Typically, she gains 1 stamina per turn for an amount of turns depending on her roll quality, the contents of the nightmare, and/or GM discretion."
ability,Magano,Nightmare Brigade,2,1,"Magano, with a sword in all three of her hands, slashes in a line up to her movement...and nothing happens...yet. Every unit that was in that line gains a mark. As an anytime action that costs 0 stamina, Magano can figuratively sheathe one of her swords, thereby activating her slash. An activated slash will either deal 5 damage or heal 4 stamina (Magano’s choice). Once Magano activates the third slash, any other marks she left during the initial attack disappear. Don’t worry about that third hand. (Prof 26) The Nightmare Begins - Magano gains a +2 to targeting anyone with a mark on them, advantage on activating one of her marks per round, and she can also eat the nightmare of anyone that has a mark regardless of distance."
ability,Magano,Magano Grind,3,0,"Magano jumps into the air and a grind rail appears under her feet that she starts to grind on. While on this grind rail, she can make a basic attack as a Bonus Action and her movement is increased by 1.5x. The rail is not visibly connected to anything and can go up to 3 spaces in height (it can start that high as well). When it is summoned, up to 15 spaces of it can be placed at a time, but Magano needs to decide where it goes at the time of placing it, and it cannot go through units. If Magano still has rail left to travel and it is not her own turn she keeps moving a single space per turn until she runs out of rail. When Magano runs out of rail, she can spend 2 stamina to extend the rail another 10 spaces. The rail only lasts for 1 round after being placed or until Magano reaches the end of a set of placed rails. (Prof 18) The World Is My Grindspace - So long as there is a solid enough surface for it to be attached to, Magano can create rails up to the height of that surface, but the total she can place is reduced by a third rounded to her benefit. This cannot be used on ceilings and she must be within the range of her initial ability usage."
ability,Magano,Sound Sleep Tagging,1,1,"Magano rides up on her rollerblades, and with her sword starts to tag an adjacent target like she’s painting graffiti. This works surprisingly better than you might expect it to work considering she’s using a sword. This heals the target for 5 stamina, and, depending on what Magano decides to tag them with, also produces a simple extra effect that now affects that target. This not only rolls with advantage on those previously affected by her Nightmare Eater passive this combat, but is also considered a basic attack."
weapon,Retnue,Spool Hammer,,0,"7 damage 1 range. A large spool of thermally conductive chain-string acts as the head of this modified hammer.  The thread of this spool can get caught on anything Retnue swings the spool at.  The spool has 60ft of thread to work with. The chain-string can be used as its own weapon. (Prof 42) Bonk - Retnue can throw down the head of his hammer to get +1 extra movement, while the head becomes frozen over as a miniature glacier. The Spool Hammer basic attack cannot be used when this is active, and Retnue’s string is constantly attached to The Icicle Crash."
weapon,Retnue,The Icicle Crash,,0,"5 damage 2 range. While Retnue's Spool Hammer is very effective, you can never go wrong with the classic beam sword. Flipping the hammer around reveals its handle to be a beam-lance that constantly emits a blue light. The Icicle Crash can pass through all forms of DR. It has the chance to partially freeze enemies on rolls of 15+."
weapon,Retnue,Snowflake Shot,,0,"2 range 4 damage. Retnue holds the Icicle Crash up high, as a storm of blue energy orbs begin swirling around it. In an instant, he can fire them off at an enemy of his choice as a Bonus Action."
talent,Retnue,Contract List,,0,Retnue has access to constant updates on the names and a vague description of the abilities of bounties within the immediate area.
talent,Retnue,Living On The Edge,,0,"It took many years, but finally Retnue has reached peak edge, rendering him immune to emotion based effects."
passive,Retnue,Frozen Over,,1,"Retnue can either spend 3 stamina as a Bonus Action, or use his Movement Action to activate Frozen Over. Once he does, his posture loosens as he opens his mouth, allowing a cloud of frozen air to begin pouring out. This cloud envelopes Retnue’s body as he is coated by an invisible layer of ice, which stays on Retnue until he takes 10 or more damage post activating it. While this coat is on him, he is able to perfectly morph and manipulate the coat as he pleases, using it as modifiers on his actions that he can choose to roll separately or along with the base action. Along with this, he can use the coat to turn invisible, and he can spend his entire Movement Action to expend the coat, instead creating a 5x5 glacier in an area of his choice that shatters at the end of his next turn"
passive,Retnue,Black Ice,,1,"Once per Combat, Retnue may use a “Black Ice” Version of any of his abilities. The Black Ice Version must be called before being rolled."
passive,Retnue,Nuclear Winter,,0,"Cold spreads like an ever-expanding blanket. Whenever Retnue performs an attacking Main Action, Retnue can pay an additional 3 Stamina to cause either a 3x3 area including him or the area the attack occurred within/over to be overtaken by a sheet of ice. These areas, emanating a withering energy, continuously drain the heat and lifeforce of enemies standing within them, dealing 1 damage to them on entry and at the start of their turns, which increases by 1 every two times they have been affected by this within a combat (maximum 3). Along with this, the areas count as difficult terrain for enemies and decrease their rolls by 2, while having the inverse effects for Retnue. The roll modifiers are non-stacking with other roll modifiers. If an enemy unit ends their turn in one of these areas, their body is partially frozen over, cutting their next Movement Action’s range in half and inflicting the effects of Flash Freeze’s “Cold Stasis” until they leave the area. The effects of this Passive bypass ice resistances and immunities."
passive,Mera Mera No Mi,Flame Body,,2,"As Retnue’s body is made of fire, he naturally avoids most attacks. Any attack that deals 5 or less damage simply misses him by passing through his flame body. He is also immune to fire damage unless the source is significantly hotter than regular fire. Also, whenever he makes physical contact with someone they take 2 damage."
ability,Retnue,Flash Freeze,2!,1,"Retnue flash freezes something he touches for 1 round. If he targets his thread, then it will freeze beyond the thread itself, spurring forth fragmenting spikes of ice dealing 4 damage to enemies in contact with it. Once per Round. Black Ice - Retnue can selectively freeze anything/everything adjacent to him. Any empty spaces that are frozen over are difficult to walk over without slipping. As a 1 cost Bonus Action on his turn, he may turn these spaces into miniature glaciers that he can move telepathically. (Prof 57) Cold Stasis - Flash Freeze’s 1 Round of Effectiveness is now a minimum instead of a maximum. Along with this, if a unit is frozen, at the start of their turn they take 1d3-1 (minimum 1) damage, all timer based effects (such as charges, usage recharges, etc) are delayed variably, and while they remain frozen, they cannot be healed."
ability,Retnue,Crystal Copy,2!,1,"Retnue creates an ice double of himself.  This can be used in a range of 2 spaces and can block attacks. Once per round. Black Ice - Black Ice Crystal Copies are a fair bit tougher, can have up to 2 summoned at once, and melt in 2 rounds instead of one. When melted, they leave a 1x1 puddle that deals 2 damage. (Prof 25) Crystal Killshot - If a Crystal Copy of Retnue's survives, he can control it on his next turn. It has a 4 damage ice-based sabre attack, but otherwise can't do much without Retnue manipulating it. After it has one turn of life, it tragically melts unless something really big happens. Like it being created on a critical success, or it gets sentience, or something equally cool/weird. (Prof 35) Ice Sculptures - A Crystal Copy, as soon as it's summoned, can use a 1 or 2 cost ability (other than Crystal Copy) at instant speed, or simply attack. Using something with a Crystal Copy does not use up its once per round limitation."
ability,Retnue,Figure Skating Flurry,3,0,"With the elegance and refined nature expected from Retnue, he dashes forward while producing ice-tiles on the ground he moves across. The dash can go a maximum of 3 spaces, and at the end of it, Retnue performs a swift attack with The Icicle Crash. If this attack lands, he can follow up with another dash and a stronger attack. This continues until he misses or until the GM says so. If used more than thrice, it cannot be used again for the rest of combat. Black Ice - This is usable no matter how many times Figure Skating Flurry has been used prior. (Prof 52) Relentless Storm - Figure Skating Flurry can now be used thrice in a chain before losing its usage (increased from 2 times). The Icicle Crash also gains cleaving properties when using this ability. Along with this, if Retnue fails one of the initial three attacks made with Figure Skating Flurry, he can still attempt to make the others. Only failing after the first three locks him out from going for additional attacks. In this case, the increased damage from consecutive attacks from Figure Skating Flurry only applies if the previous attack successfully hit."
ability,Retnue,Glacial Skate,3⛯,0,"Coalescing his powers, Retnue creates a large 3x3 Ice Platform in front of him. After it's fully formed, Retnue winds back his hammer and slams into it, sending it careening around the arena like a hockey puck, dealing damage to everyone and everything it may run into. Retnue can choose to hop on the platform as well, allies can choose to do the same if it passes over them, while mooks would only be flattened and boss characters would need to roll. Anyone can interact with this ice sheet and send it flying at enemies, including the enemies themselves. While how long it lasts depends on the roll and environment, it usually lasts 3-4 rounds. Once per Combat. Black Ice - The platform may be either 2x2 or 4x4, deals slightly more damage, and gets everywhere it goes coated in a thin layer of ice. Retnue, while walking on this ice, can move 2 spaces while only taking one space of his movement action."
ability,Mera Mera No Mi,Fire Fist,4,1,"Retnue punches forwards as his fist becomes a massive travelling fireball. This causes a 3x10 area in front of him in a single cardinal direction (long end facing forwards) which deals 8 damage to everyone within. On a 16 or higher this inflicts a burn status, which deals 1d4 damage at the start of their turns and can be staved off with a roll."
ability,Mera Mera No Mi,Saint Elmo's Fire,X,0,"X is capped at 3. Retnue creates X lances made up of flame, which travel up to 8 spaces and pierce targets for 4 damage each. Notably, the fire lances pierce through most defenses like DR."
weapon,Viktor,Cane of Whimsey,,0,4 damage 1 range. A bedazzled cane with a color scheme that makes it resemble a stereotypical black-and-white magician’s wand.
weapon,Viktor,Flare Gun,,0,"1 damage 3 range. By removing a cap at the end of his cane, Viktor can reveal a miniature flare gun nestled inside! On higher end rolls, it can inflict a 1d4 burn status. (Prof 46) Flare of Flair and Fanfare - Viktor’s Flare Gun gains +1 damage (1 to 2)."
talent,Viktor,Escape Artist,,0,"Whenever Viktor is trapped, he can pull a Houdini and simply get out of it by using a move action"
talent,Viktor,This is MY Time Slot,,0,Viktor deals more damage against other magicians.
talent,Viktor,Eternal Suffering,,0,Viktor is immune to emotional damage due to desensitization.
passive,Viktor,Entertainer at Heart,,0,"As Viktor does more and more tricks, the more successful they are, the more the audience goes wild. This gives Viktor “Glamour Points” that he can expend to make a roll more potent. However, if his tricks fail spectacularly, and the audience is unimpressed, he can lose Glamour Points. Having this happen when he’s at zero Glamour Points does actual damage to him. 1 Glamour Point has a conversion rate to 2 for a roll. (Prof 40) Break a Leg - Every time Viktor fails a roll while having no Glamour Points, the enemies begin to pity him more and more, dealing 1 emotional damage back to them."
passive,Viktor,Tough Crowd,,0,"Once Viktor’s started to eat enough shit by failing a few rolls in enough of a succession, the metaphysical crowd will start jeering him and throwing tomatoes onto the stage. This means that everyone, on their turn, has to roll to avoid getting pelted by them. If someone is hit, the tomatoes will reduce their rolls slightly. The tomato storm stops once Viktor starts succeeding."
passive,Viktor,Be Amazed,,1,"Viktor's act seems to have an almost bewitching and captivating effect thanks to his epithet (cuz it sure doesn't without it). Whenever Viktor successfully performs any main action that involves some kind of circus act, all enemies within 3 range of him gain the Dazzled status for the next 4 turns on turn order. Dazzled characters can't use anytimes and have halved movement. Viktor also gains +1 Glamour points for each target he inflicts with Dazzled, with this passive or otherwise."
ability,Viktor,Thank You For Volunteering,3⛯!,1,"In a flash, Viktor grabs a unit that is attacking him or an adjacent ally and makes them an involuntary volunteer in a dazzling trick of grand proportions. Depending on the trick Viktor decides to do, the effects and/or damage of the ability may vary. Once per combat. (Prof 74) An Act of Grand Proportions - Using May I Have a Volunteer on a Dazzled target does not use its once per combat charge."
ability,Viktor,The Art of Distraction,1!,1,"Viktor can allow an ally to reroll a given action by performing a trick that grabs the attention of everyone in the arena. This gives the ally enough time to try again. Once per round. (Prof 34) Say Thank You To My Assistant - Whenever you help someone out with The Art of Distraction, Viktor can pass off the teammate’s move suddenly succeeding while no one was looking as if done by magic! This means he gets Glamour Points from both your roll on the ability AND your teammate’s new roll, and he doesn't lose Glamour Points if the teammate fucks up their second roll either."
ability,Viktor,The Show Goes On,1,1,"Viktor continues his show by performing a trick. He rolls a d20 like any other ability to see if it’s successful, and if it is, he rolls a d10 to determine what trick he does. If no acceptable targets are within range for a specific trick, then Viktor can hold off on performing said trick until he is within range. However, he can not have more than one trick saved at once. Viktor’s Trick List https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNElqWojeYlJX1yPHwYRM1WHfONXePJ-fSGb3roR5v4/edit?usp=sharing  (Prof 14) Wow! Even Better Tricks? - Viktor can upgrade one of his tricks to a brand spanking new version! (Used on Trick 3) (Prof 20) More Tricks Up These Sleeves! - An upgrade to that garbage “ability” Viktor calls The Show Goes On to make it actually good! He no longer has a limit to how many tricks he can have stored. When Viktor uses this ability, instead of rolling to see if he gets a stored trick he instead automatically gets one regardless of his roll. Instead, if he succeeds the roll he gets another trick stored and gets to roll again to store even more! If he fails a roll, he stops adding tricks. Each of these rolls can generate Glamour Points. When he successfully gets a stored trick beyond the first he can choose to stop rolling and use the trick he got on a target within range immediately with that roll from before. (Prof 36) Wow! Even Better Tricks? 2 - Viktor can upgrade one of his tricks to a brand spanking new version...again! (Used on Trick 4) (Prof 38) Tricks! Anytime, Anywhere! - Viktor can now use tricks gained from The Show Goes On as once per round bonus actions on his turn, so he can use one a turn without using his main action, or use two in one turn. (Prof 50) Fuck I Should Have Made These Earlier - Viktor adds the last two tricks I should have made earlier to his The Show Must Go On trick list. (Prof 64) Wow! Even Better Tricks? 3 - Choose another three of Viktor’s tricks, and they get upgraded to a new version from the boosted trick list! Reminder that he can’t upgrade a trick that’s already been upgraded. He also doesn’t have upgrades for his 10 new tricks. (Used on Trick 1, 5, and 7)"
ability,Viktor,Disappearing Act,2!,1,"Viktor can willingly vanish into a puff of smoke and appear up to 9 spaces away, dodging an attack in the process! Once per round (Prof 42) Exit Stage Anywhere - Disappearing Act’s movement range is increased from 6 to 9 spaces."
ability,Viktor,The Ol' Razzle-Dazzle,1,1,"You can spend Glamour Points as a Bonus Action on your turn to make an item or person’s outfit more sparkly and glamorous. This applies a less potent but lasting boost to the user/wearer’s rolls, more specifically a 1 to +1 ratio between Glamour Points spent and bonuses to their rolls. The boosts last until the end of combat (or longer if they are used towards the end) and you can put any amount of them you want into one boost. Glamorousness can also be done in specific designs like ribbons or glitter or rhinestones to try and RP other effects."
ability,Viktor,My Beautiful Assistants,5!,1,"Around Viktor, 2-4 glittery assistant constructs appear to help him with whatever act he’s putting on at the time! These assistants can each take an action to either assist with any move to increase its roll by +3 each, or alternatively they can work just like Viktor to do whatever action he is currently doing at halved effectiveness on their own! They each roll for this separately. After they perform an action, Viktor must pay 2 stamina each to keep an assistant around afterwards, otherwise they deconstitute. They have 5 stamina and 5 movement each, and Viktor cannot have more than 4 on the field (unless his Outclass is active). Once per Round."
ability,Viktor,The Show-Stopper!,3⛯,0,"Viktor pulls out the ultimate closer to a packed showing: The Show-Stopper! It’s a MASSIVE fuck you cannon, a 5x11 construct which fires out one of its ends for a 5xInfinite line attack which deals a CHUNKY 16 damage to anyone within, friend or foe. Afterwards, The Show-Stopper dissolves into glitter. The cannon can be created anywhere on the map facing any direction. Using this move can only be shared for special occasions. As such, Viktor can only use it during the final phase of the final combat of a session. The fight also has to be worthy of the showing, with rewards within the 4 proficiency range or above for rewards. Once per Combat."
weapon,Beetlebob,Spiderwing Bat,,0,"A baseball with a cool bat wing decal, and also legs for some reason?"
talent,Beetlebob,"Thrills, Chills, Kills!",,0,"As an announcer, it’s your job to make exhilarating commentary! The more announcer-y and showtunes-y Beetlebob acts, the less reality starts to function around him, giving him actual cartoon physics in real life! Or, in mechanical terms, use an announcer voice to use cartoon logic on your actions!"
passive,Beetlebob,Holistic Baseball,,1,"Okay okay, so the last gimmick didn’t actually work. But THIS TIME it’ll be pretty great! Come up with some random fucking gimmick like boxing gloves or hurdles or magma rain at the start of every combat. Enemies gain a +3 in using these gimmicks, but only when trying to kill each other! Isn’t this fun? (Prof 16) Sponsorship Deal - THIS MURDER WAS SPONSORED BY… well, whatever Beetlebob chooses. At some point during the combat, he may choose something to “sponsor” this game of Holistic Baseball. Things relating to that sponsorship become… weirdly present and likely, in a way that’s hard to describe."
ability,Beetlebob,Little Lethal,1,0,"Beetlebob throws out a baseball made of an incredibly… kinetic material. Roll to hit someone. However, that person can then roll to knock it away and have it hit another person instead, and that person can do the same, on and on until someone rolls a 5 or less. Deals 3 damage initially, but for every reflection it deals +1 damage due to it gaining speed. The ball can also be ricochet or hit into objects for alternative effects like knockback. Range of 10."
ability,Beetlebob,Glorious Hitter,3,0,"Beetlebob might be mostly an announcer, but he’s got a little game himself! For each enemy in a baseball diamond shape (bases are 3 spaces to diagonal up right, then 3 up left, then 3 down left, then down right 3) dash through, dealing 5 damage to the enemies he dashes through on the way to the bases and knocking them out of the way, and 8 damage to those on the bases plus hitting them with his baseball bat, punting them in any direction you want! Has a 3 round cooldown though."
ability,Beetlebob,They Put Bugs In 'Em,1,0,"Literally just disintegrate into bugs. While Beetlebob’s a bunch of bugs enemies roll disadvantage to attack him, he can climb on people to deal a continuous 4 damage without an action on their turn, fit into small spaces, and most importantly: spread out across the arena to perform combo techs with all his little bug parts working in tandem doing stuff! They can even limitedly control electricity and fire. Beetlebob can reform into his “humanoid form” as a bonus action on his turn."
weapon,Pyrite,The Sickle Cell Sickle,,0,"This is what Pyrite calls this attack, but in reality, he just scratches you in the face."
weapon,Pyrite,MY BLOOOOOOOOD,,0,"Pyrite flings some of his blood out at an opponent, hardening it while it flies through the air. It acts as a 2x1 projectile, and is just barely under the threshold for Pyrite taking damage for using it. The blood is left on the space the hit target(s) are standing on. (Prof 12) Blood Transfusion - If Pyrite somehow manages to strike an open wound with MY BLOOOOOOOOD, his funky multi-type blood is rejected by the target. This causes them to take 2 extra damage and 1 more damage at the start of their next turn. This technically applies to all of Pyrite’s blood based attacks (which is pretty much all of them), but it is most effective with MY BLOOOOOOOOD."
talent,Pyrite,Blood Type Tyrant,,0,"Pyrite’s Epithet makes it so his blood essentially acts as all types at once. Therefore, he is neither a universal donor nor a universal receiver."
passive,Pyrite,Roaring Riptide,,1,"Just about everything Pyrite does involves him sloshing his own blood around. Due to his Epithet, this is potent, and Pyrite can elect to spend extra stamina or max stamina on any of his actions to make them more effective and/or deal more damage. If he does this, the action also leaves 1 more blood puddle on the ground more than it usually does. However, if he uses max stamina, he can also get a blood-related followup after the action. After spending max stamina, he does not regain until the end of the session. He can also absorb blood adjacent to him to heal as a main action. [DYLAXAPHI - DARK EVOLUTION] Magne-Iron - Pyrite’s blood, through Shadowrealm influence, has been made to be magnetic! With this property, not only can he attract metal into it, but he can also regain 1d2 Max Stamina lost from Roaring Riptide at the start of his turn."
passive,Pyrite,Nasty Crash Protection,,0,"Once per Combat, after Pyrite is hit by an attack, he can choose to have the wound created from it (technically creating an open gash if the attack would not usually give him one) suddenly be overtaken by a massive, coagulated blood clot. Once it is fully bloated, it explodes, sending a glob of Pyrite’s blood to the person who hit him that deals half the damage Pyrite took +1d3. Pyrite can choose to have a blood puddle produced either adjacent to him or the person hit. From here, the wound this was produced from becomes covered in a scab, and Pyrite heals for 1 stamina at the start of every other turn until he has healed for half or more of the original attack, determined by rolling 1dX (X = damage dealt to Pyrite) (minimum of half of original damage)."
ability,Pyrite,Hang Five,1!,1,"Pyrite pulls out his surfboard and produces a bubble of blood that bursts and releases a red wave that Pyrite can ride. The wave can travel in any direction anywhere from 3-7 spaces, and anything that gets picked up by the wave is dragged with Pyrite and takes 1 damage each space they travel. If there are blood puddles on the ground, all of them also become waves that can be moved independently of Pyrite. Once per Round. (Prof 17) GNARLY!!! - If Pyrite leads waves other than one he is riding into HIS wave, he gets an extra +2 movement for each."
ability,Pyrite,The Blood House,3⛯,1,"Pyrite clenches his fist as a pool of blood congeals around a chosen target’s feet. It then shoots up and traps them within a blood clot, encasing them within and holding them in place. While in “The Blood House”, a trapped unit cannot move or use any action that requires that they move their body more than very slightly, and they take 1 damage at the start of their turns. To break out, they must roll a check higher than Pyrite’s initial roll to trap them, and they can use both their movement action and their main action to attempt this. Each round they are trapped inside, the DC is reduced by three. If used on himself, Pyrite does not suffer the negative effects of being in The Blood House, and can shatter it at will. Once per Combat."
ability,Pyrite,Clot Kaboom,3,0,"With a scream, Pyrite causes a nearby buildup of blood to explode violently. This activates as a 5x5 blast with him at its center, and also causes all blood puddles on the field to produce a 3x3 explosion. Regardless of which version hits someone it deals 3-5 damage per explosion."
ability,Pyrite,SHARK IN THE WATER,3,1,"With a stupid laugh, Pyrite performs an underhand swing that transitions into a skyward shaka. Doing this produces a wave of blood that travels across the ground, morphing into an iconic shark fin. It travels up to 4 spaces in a direction, dealing 4-5 damage to each enemy hit, before then circling a 4x4 area including the last space it traveled into. Only two sharks can be present on the field at once, and sharks can be attacked to try and remove them. As a once per turn, 1 cost anytime, Pyrite can have a shark jump up into the air, attacking a unit in the 4x4 with a vicious bite. This deals 5-6 damage, and Pyrite can have the shark send a hit unit flying in a direction of his choice. If he wants, he can have this shark target himself or an ally to give them a movement boostie. Each unit in combat can only be targeted once per round, and for each activation within a round, the anytime has its cost increased by one."
weapon,Raphael,Letter Opener,,0,4 damage 1 range. A switchblade that looks like a letter opener. It’s not. It’s a switchblade. But I suppose it could be used as a letter opener. A tool of many crafts.
talent,Raphael,Squeakums,,0,"Raphael has a pet rat. They have 5 Stamina and deal 3 damage at melee with 7 Movement. He’s very good at wielding human weaponry for some reason and can of course chew through anything with less strength than steel. (Prof 18) Ratcatcher - While Squeakums is on Raphael’s person, he does not trigger attacks of opportunity nor traps. Squeakums receives +1 Movement (6 to 7)."
passive,Raphael,Every Frame A Painting,,0,"Raphael can freely travel into art, whether it be sculptures, paintings, pictures, movies, anything that Raphael would consider to be art. From there, he can interact with things within the art, even pulling them out into the real world. He can hide within art to avoid detection, or even move from one art piece to another one nearby."
ability,Raphael,First Editions,1,0,"Raphael’s contractors generally give him some pretty good forgeries of famous art pieces, to replace the originals when he snags them. He can pull out any real (or made up) painting and set it down somewhere, or hold it, or hang it up, or whatever. Raphael can immediately use Every Frame A Painting on it the turn he summons it."
ability,Raphael,Night At The Museum,2,0,Cause any set of drawings or sculptures to animate and pop out of the pictures if applicable! This lets Raphael turn them into minions that fight for him.
ability,Raphael,Blank Canvas,3⛯,0,"Raphael pulls out a blank canvas and paints on it. Starting immediately, Raphael will list what he adds to the painting and the desired effect to go with it at the start of each of his turns. In three turns, he’ll have listed three effects, and the work will be done. From there, Raphael can both use this canvas with his other abilities, as well as gain a new ability that causes all three painted effects to happen! Once per Combat."
ability,Raphael,Impressionist Viewpoint,1,0,"Oftentimes something that emulates our conception of a thing is better than the real thing itself. With this ability, Raphael may pull out an item no bigger than what can fit in a 20” by 24“ by 20“ cubic area. It is constructed of impressionist brush strokes in 3D space. While the item is ineffective for use outside of people’s conception of the object, it has an innate nonstacking +1 to all rolls when it comes to accomplishing its associated purpose and can perform usually impossible tasks adjacent to that (for example, an impressionist sword would be almost useless at blocking, but could cut through even metal materials). This can be used as a Bonus Action Once per Combat, and as a Main Action other times. Raphael can only have one of these active at once and can dispel it at will."
weapon,Saffron,Ornate Fans,,0,"4 damage 3 range. Two sharp throwing fans, one that’s literally made out of $100 bills, and another pink frilly one that not only has a gold lining, but also is “graced” with a portrait of Saffron on it that’s surrounded by a giant red heart."
weapon,Saffron,You Are Beneath Me!,,0,"5 damage 1 range. Saffron stomps down on an adjacent target, dealing 5 damage as they are forced to the ground. If the unit she is using this on is Svelte Build, this deals +1 damage."
talent,Saffron,Absolutely Loaded,,0,Saffron can basically buy anything at any given moment. Her family’s riches know no bounds.
passive,Saffron,Dollhouse Accessory Catalogue,,1,"Saffron, always putting fashion first, is always on top of the newest available articles up for purchase. That, her nigh unlimited money, and her love of style and aesthetics grants her access to 5 separate shopping catalogs full of accessories for her to choose from. At the start of a session, she rolls 1d5 to determine which of her catalogs are currently online and able to be purchased from. Combat Catalogs - On the start of each of Saffron’s turns, she can pick one item from her current catalog to receive at the start of her next turn. Saffron can also choose to forego choosing an item, instead subscribing to another of her catalogs as a free action. Items gained from this Passive are kept after the end of a combat, but if Saffron wants to keep them into start of the next combat, she must spend half of her movement and not get to choose an item on her first turn. She is also restricted to one catalog at the start of a combat, so if she currently has multiple unlocked, she must choose which to keep. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whLNjHLelIY7aISY0ncyuFf2_wp0UQ4mAdrhUm3srow/edit?usp=sharing "
ability,Saffron,Take Care Of It For Me,2!,1,"Saffron pulls out her cell phone and calls up one of her butlers, whom she calls her “Dolls”. Not wanting to get docked any pay, they immediately dart onto the battlefield to perform an action before leaving just as promptly. They can come from any direction/place, regardless of how seemingly illogical it may be. On rolls of 16 or higher, the Doll comes in with whatever item Saffron is currently ordering via her Passive, and she can choose a new one to receive on her next turn. Once per round."
ability,Saffron,Money Makes The World Go Round,3,0,"Saffron doesn’t feel like overexerting herself right now, so instead, someone else can go do something. With a complete lack of care, she tosses a stupid amount of cash at a unit of her choice. If used on an ally, they are paid to take another action. If used on an enemy, she pays them to perform an action of her choice. An enemy’s vulnerability to this ability is dependent on how swayed they are by money. (Prof 19) All Expenses Paid - Saffron sighs, she really really doesn’t feel like it right now. By making this ability a full turn action Saffron can give the target of her choice a move action in addition to the regular action. When targeting an enemy with this version she rolls with advantage, but they do not have the move action. If she rolls an 18+ when doing this, she does not need to make this a full turn action."
ability,Saffron,Chasing Riches,1,0,"Pulling out one of her purses, Saffron whistles as she begins to swing the thing around. This purse is filled to the brim with gold bars, and can hit a unit for 3-4 damage on the initial swing. After the windup, she throws the purse to a space within 4 of her current position. Almost immediately, a swarm of Dolls attempt to swoop in and take this extra pay for themselves. The mob can either take the form of a flash mob that instantly congregates in an area around the purse, or as a “line attack” that can drag objects and units with them."
talent,Yami,Hidden Ability: Prankster,,2,"Yami’s ability now changes to Prankster. Prankster is an ability that allows Yami to use a status move right before an enemy's turn, making any status move an anytime action. When this is used, it has priority over other start of turn effects, including the effects of Yami's own abilities. Once per Round."
passive,Yami,"Wow, You Already Know Type Matchups?",,2,"Hahaha Yami is a bit ""strange"". This means that a number of things are different for her. For starters, her ""typing"" is Ghost/Dark, which means that attacks or abilities that would be considered ""Normal"", ""Fighting"", or ""Psychic"" Type damage do not affect her, and she takes ½ damage from ""Poison"" attacks. These resistances can be easily avoided if the attacker can flavor the ability correctly. Yami is also from ""Generation 5"" so ""Fairy"" based typing and damage just has normal effectiveness against her."
weapon,Bishop,Brains Over Brawn,,0,"Bishop is not one to throw simple punches. Instead, he utilizes his psychic powers either to produce damaging waves of mental energy, or to telekinetically lift and/or slam a chosen target within 6 spaces. The damage dealt from the second variation is dependent on what Bishop chooses to do with the hit target. 4 damage 4 range."
talent,Bishop,Brainiac Barrier,,0,"Seeing as how Bishop’s strength comes from his mental ability, his mind is nigh unbreakable. As such, he is immune to mental effects/damage and, in fact, reflects them back onto the person who attempted to inflict him with it."
ability,Bishop,The Thinking Man,2,0,"With a snap, Bishop conjures a chair that he sits in with one leg crossed over the other. He places his hand onto a chin and begins thinking about some sort of topic. It can be something as broad as “complex math problems” or as specific as “if robots do, in fact, dream of electric sheep, would that imply that they are self aware of their inherent differences from regular sheep?”. Depending on what he chooses to think about, an effect of his choice is constantly emanating as an aura in a chosen 2x2 area. Bishop can have up to two of these areas on the field at once."
ability,Bishop,Mental Shutdown,1!,1,"Bishop’s eyes glow for a brief moment as a target of his choice is dizzied/stunned instantly. If this ability is used as an interrupt, it cancels out an action the target is currently performing. Also, if Bishop rolls a 16 or higher, the target’s next movement is cancelled. Once per round."
weapon,Cardinal,Pure Mass,,0,"Cardinal produces a grey ball of non distinct matter that follows his hand as he moves it. He can then use it as a 5 damage melee weapon while he performs complex, dance-like motions."
talent,Cardinal,The World Is My Toolbox,,0,"Cardinal has a near infinite supply of pocket sized items that he can use for his abilities, but most of the time he does need to roll for more complex items."
ability,Cardinal,Atomic Space Molding,2,0,"Taking an object either on his person or adjacent to him, Cardinal uses his Epithet to rearrange its molecules and reform it either as a 2x2 cube or a 1x6 skewer. Depending on the object that he uses to make the new object, its properties change. If he wants, Cardinal can instead construct the object purely out of non distinct grey matter. In this case, it typically deals around 7-8 damage when used to attack others."
ability,Cardinal,State Shift,1!,1,"Cardinal focuses on a chosen object for a moment before said object suddenly experiences a change in its state of matter. He can either change something to be in a state that it wasn’t before for whatever reason he may desire, or simply enhance the solidity/liquidity/gaseousness of matter already in that state. The quality of his roll determines how long that object remains in that state, and he can also revert something to its original state on command. Once per round."
weapon,Bishardinal,Playing Around,,0,"Bishardinal’s aura flares up as he delivers a series of rapid kicks and/or punches, oftentimes with cocky quotes or extra flair for the hell of it. 6 damage 1 range."
weapon,Bishardinal,Mass Destruction,,0,Bishardinal produces a grey ball of matter with a strange energy coating its surface. He can throw it as a projectile that can explode on contact to cause minor knockback. 5 damage 4 range.
weapon,Bishardinal,Psycho Control,,0,"Crossing his arms, Bishardinal uses his telekinesis to lift a chosen target and contort/throw them as he wishes. Damage is dependent on what exactly it is that he does. This is a Bonus Action."
talent,Bishardinal,Best of Both Worlds,,0,Bishardinal has the Talents of both Bishop and Cardinal.
ability,Bishardinal,Space of The Mastermind,2,0,"Using a combination of the mental and the material, Bishardinal produces any thing/object of his choice. He then either uses it once, able to morph its form in the process, or transforms it into a 3x3 space that imbues effects related to the object."
ability,Bishardinal,Dreams Into Reality,1!,1,"The air surrounding Bishardinal begins to waver as he reaches into a chosen target’s psyche. From there, he takes the target’s perception of a particular form of matter and brings it into the material plane. The target is temporarily suspended in an orb of the substance, which may halt their action and/or inflict other effects dependent on the material. Once per round."
ability,Bishardinal,Plasmic Star Shower,3⛯,1,"Bishardinal’s energy comes to a climax as he uses his mental energy to harness the material and energy of plasma. He then fires this mixture into the sky, resulting in a cosmic wave of meteors falling onto the battlefield. These meteors hit every enemy in a 5x5 area of Bishardinal’s choice dealing 8-11 damage initially. However, if the roll used to activate this ability is 15 or higher, Bishardinal can roll again to send another wave of 3 damage meteors onto each target. Once per Combat. (Prof 32) Torrential Downpour - Plasmic Star Shower’s exploding dice meteor waves now deal 5 damage, and if Bishardinal does not reach the 15+ requirement to initiate the wave(s) on the initial ability roll, he can spend stamina equal to the difference of 15 and the roll’s value to cause the first wave to occur."
weapon,Breeze,Radi-Kick,,0,"Breeze punches and/or kicks a target of his choice. In doing so, knockback may be applied, and Breeze often taunts a little bit after showcasing his sick skills. 4 damage 1 range."
talent,Breeze,"Yo, Yo-Yo!",,0,"Breeze has a cool ass set of yo-yos! Sick! Whenever he is performing an action, he can add the sentence: “Breeze also uses his trusty yo-yos, swinging them to add some extra blunt damage to this action,” onto it. Doing so costs 1 stamina, but he can modify this sentence with One Bad Gloop."
talent,Breeze,Pioneer of Pizzaz,,0,"Breeze is full of surprises, and he always has something up his sleeve! Always. As a free anytime action on his turn, Breeze may stylishly pull a small object out of his sleeve or pocket! Alongside just being used, it can be incorporated with a basic attack or ability to add effects or flavor. (This talent can be affected by One Bad Gloop)."
passive,Breeze,One Bad Gloop,,1,"And she do, in fact, what I yoinky. Breeze is...an interesting young man with an interesting vocabulary. Whenever he uses an action, he can replace any word within said action’s text with one of his personal favorite words. He has a lot of favorites. In non-cheeky speak, these words are gibberish that can be interpreted in many different crazy ways. If he pays 1-2 stamina, he can cause the replaced word to stay that way for the rest of combat."
ability,Breeze,Cool Guy Assault,2,0,"Breeze smirks before bolting forward at incredible speeds. This allows him to run up to his movement in a straight line, and any enemies he dashes through get knocked to the side and take 4-6 damage. However, the last enemy affected by this is special. Breeze performs a stylish flip-kick on them, knocking them up into the air while dealing a solid 6-9 damage. Nice. The hit unit produces a small shockwave when they hit the ground, potentially damaging adjacent units."
ability,Breeze,Radi-Kool Shot,X,0,"With a flourish of his hands, Breeze forms a ball constructed of pure Ki. It crackles with energy while flashing a different color every second. After he is done charging, Breeze fires the ball at a unit within 6 spaces of his current location. As it flies through the air, Breeze can mold its shape, thereby impacting any damage it deals and any extra effects it may impart. Stamina cost is determined by severity."
ability,Breeze,Cool Quickie,1!,1,"Breeze kicks his heels as he begins floating in the air. At this point, he can zoom to any location within 3 spaces, doing a cool pose along the way. While this happens, a rainbow aura surrounds him, and he can phase through solid objects. Once the movement has been taken, Breeze returns to the ground as sparks fly off of him. Once per Round."
weapon,Kuro,Crmson Slash,,1,"Kuro wields the Blade Of Boundaries, a tachi that gleams red as an ocean of blood. 6 damage 1 range. (Prof 17) Blade Honing - +1 damage and range (6 to 7, 1 to 2). - Echo: Double Crimson Slash (0) - The attack is repeated again on the same target, though it only deals 3 damage this time.  The source of the effect is triggered on the space the target currently occupies.  (For larger targets, it can trigger on a space of her choice). (Prof 14) Iai Technique - When Kuro uses the ‘Delayed’ Echo effect on Double Crimson Slash, she can now assume a crouched stance with her sword sheathed, during which time she cannot take any actions, including activating other Echoes. When Double Crimson Slash would activate, she can instead teleport to the space it would activate from and make a regular Crimson Slash attack with advantage, its effectiveness increased by the Delayed effect as normal. She must have the delay last for at least 2 initiative turns if she does this. (Prof 22) Echo: Oblivion’s Trigram (3) - This Echo is a passive effect that charges by 1 each time Kuro uses a different Echo after attacking a target with Crimson Slash successfully. If she attacks a different target with Crimson Slash, the charges reset to 0 and no effect occurs. However, the next time she attacks the marked target with Crimson Slash or Double Crimson Slash, she can pay this Echo’s Stamina cost to follow up the slash with a series of rapid cuts that form the pattern of the Akadora family crest. The target is marked with stacks of Oblivion equal to the number of charges this Echo had when it was used.  Each stack of Oblivion on a target decreases all damage they deal by 1 (minimum half rounded down of the original damage value, minimum of 1 in all cases), and they take damage equal to the stacks at the end of each of their turns.  When they take damage from these stacks, the number of stacks on them are halved, rounded down. This Echo cannot be applied to the same target twice at the same time.  If it is Repeated, it could potentially hit a second target if Kuro also Shifts it or makes it Larger."
talent,Kuro,Midnight's Messenger,,0,Kuro gains 1 movement.
passive,Kuro,Boundary of The Self,,1,"Kuro possesses the Blade Of Boundaries, which allows her to collapse the space between two points; most often, her blade and the foe to be cut down. This also allows her to traverse great distances without any movement or effort on her part, becoming a shadowy blur of black and red.On her turn, Kuro can double move without spending her main action, can move, attack, and move again, and in addition, her unused movement acts as a secondary resource for her abilities. Her attacks and abilities have active components or ongoing effects called ‘Echoes’ that Kuro can utilize later. Kuro can spend the corresponding Stamina cost as a once-per round anytime action to trigger the Echoes of attacks or abilities she has used within the past round. Kuro can also apply additional effects to modify these Echoes, but each effect has an associated movement cost, and each one she applies to the Echo costs 1 Stamina to trigger regardless of its movement cost. These effects end immediately once they are triggered. She has the following options as additional effects to apply to Echoes: Larger (2 Movement) - Kuro dramatically increases the size of the effect, allowing it to hit a much larger area (roughly one dimension larger per use, e.g. a 3x3 becomes a 4x4) or become stronger and more durable. Further (X Movement) -  Extends the range of a given effect along a single axis; elongation rather than simple enlargement.  It extends roughly 2 spaces per point of movement spent. Faster (3 Movement) -  The effect becomes much more difficult to counter or avoid. Delayed (X Movement) - The effect’s activation is delayed by a number of turns equal to the movement Kuro spends on this effect. For each turn it is delayed, its effectiveness increases slightly, and the movement cost of all other effects Kuro uses is reduced by 1. When it does activate during a turn, it can activate at any point in the turn Kuro wishes. Repeated (5 Movement) - The effect occurs again, retaining all extra effects Kuro has spent on it so far. Shifted (3 Movement) - The effect in its entirety travels across the battlefield to a location of Kuro’s choice. Warped (3 Movement) -  The effect hits a different area than one would expect, as if its perspective was warped in a drawing program. The total area that it damages is unaffected."
ability,Kuro,It Tolls For Thee,4,0,"Kuro silently sheathes her blade while crouching near the ground.  For her chosen enemy, the sky seems to darken.  Kuro rushes forward in a 1xinfinite line towards a chosen enemy.  All mundane objects or obstacles in her path are torn asunder.  The target itself takes 5 damage and is knocked prone, and Kuro rolls 1d4. If she rolls a 4, this attack’s damage is quadrupled and this ability cannot be used again during this combat.  When Kuro uses this ability in combat and does not roll a 4, then if she uses it again during a future combat in this session, the die will be a 1d3 instead, and so on in this pattern until it is a 1d1.  The die resets if she rolls perfectly.  Note that if there are other living targets in her path between herself and her target, they will take damage equal to the amount rolled on the second die, unless she rolls perfectly, in which case they take double the die’s damage. Echo: Reaper’s Toll (1!) - Do you hear the ringing of the bells?  A crimson shade of a cloaked figure holding a scythe appears above a target of Kuro’s choice who she has used ‘It Tolls For Thee’ on during the past round is marked with a stacking debuff that starts at 0 and has a maximum of 5.  Each time the target moves or takes an action, the stack increases by 1.  The next time the target takes damage, it is increased by an amount equal to the debuff’s stacks.  Applying additional effects to this echo can cause the shade to switch targets or even spread the debuff across multiple targets, applying them to all within its range, which is a 1x1 square by default."
ability,Kuro,Metal Maelstrom,2,0,"Assuming a stance, Kuro lashes her sword in a circle around her, dealing 4 damage to adjacent targets of her choice. This then creates a 3x3 area centered on herself where the attack seems to continue in a continuous maelstrom, the slash itself continuing to tear through enemies.  She can immediately move out of this effect without spending movement.  Anyone who enters the area of the slash or starts their turn there takes 2 damage. This lasts for one round. Echo: Rose of Farewell (2!) - The whirling blade suddenly distorts and flares, a myriad of slashes bursting out from it in a dazzling pattern.  Anyone in the blade’s area when this is used is knocked aside, has -2 movement on their next turn, and takes 5 damage."
ability,Kuro,Sever The Shadow,3,0,"Kuro prefers to work alone, yet she understands that two blades are sometimes better than one. With a swift slash, she cuts her own shadow from her physical body, and it morphs into a silhouetted duplicate of herself that’s under her control. It has 5 Stamina by default, but Kuro may spend unused movement to increase it by 3 per space of movement spent. She can also funnel Stamina into it at a 1:1 ratio when it’s created. The shadow has all of Kuro’s usual capabilities except for her passive. It can act on her turn, but the shadow must roll as normal. However, the shadow does not have to make a roll if the shadow copies the same action she performs at equivalent effectiveness (though it cannot copy the extra damage of crits). This ability is a Bonus Action, but only one shadow can exist at a time. (Prof 20) Shadows Die Twice - The first time Kuro’s shadow summoned with Sever The Shadow would be destroyed in a combat, it is instead revived adjacent to Kuro with 25% (rounded down, minimum of 1) of its maximum Stamina. After this happens, Kuro is then able summon an additional shadow of herself to the battlefield as though the first one was destroyed; however, she and each of her shadows must pay 2 upkeep at the start of each of her turns in order to keep them both manifested. Any healing applied to the revived shadow is also heavily reduced. Echo: Speed of Darkness (0!) - This Echo is a passive effect that activates whenever Kuro uses another Echo. The shadow, if it’s possible for it to do so, uses the same Echo, without spending any Stamina or movement. Note that if Kuro and her shadow’s Echoes overlap to affect the same target, the damage of the shadow’s echo is somewhat reduced. In addition, Kuro can choose to apply any of her Echo effects to her shadow’s actions instead of her own."
ability,Kuro,Dragon Lance Rush,2!,1,"Black flames to burn the wicked. Kuro charges forward in a 1x6 space line, thrusting her blade as she does so, dealing 3 damage to all targets in the line. This can potentially block attacks, or even interrupt them on high rolls, depending on where Kuro ends up in the line. She can end the ability in a space before its maximum if she wishes. Once per Round. Echo: Shadow Rift (2!) - Abyssal energy seethes from the line Kuro drew across the battlefield with her earlier attack. It lashes outwards and attempts to restrain and deal minor damage to nearby targets. In addition, if Kuro uses another Echo while this one is active, she can choose one of the possible listed effects and apply it to this one for free."
weapon,Tai,Thermal Sword,,0,"A sword whose blade is made of constantly super heated metal, making it act more like a lightsaber. 6 damage 1 range. (Prof 22) My Life As A Teenage-to-Young Adult Android - Tai can change the elemental polarity of her Thermal Blade or the weapons from her body to be considered electrical, plasma/energy, or cold."
talent,Tai,PCHOOOOO,1!,1,"Tai’s feet can fold out to reveal jets that let her FLY! Forever. (Prof 14) Rocket Power! - Tai’s jets can now be used as a once per round anytime, letting her use the propulsion or heat of the flames to dash around, singe things, etc. It also helps that her Hardlight Landmarks are compatible with rocket fuel!"
talent,Tai,*wink wink nudge nudge*,,,"When Tai defeats an enemy or is within 3 spaces of a defeated enemy, if she gives a suitably cheesy but fitting one liner, she gets +1 proficiency or +2 maximum stamina. Depending on the quality, she may also heal for 1-3 stamina."
passive,Tai,Someplace I Wanna Be,,2,"At the start of combat, choose one: - Tai can designate a 3x3 area on the map. Whenever she or an ally stands in that spot, they experience calm, focus, and confidence, which quells their anxiety and makes their actions roll with a +3. Once designated, vein roots sprout through the ground in each cardinal direction in relation to the area. The area and veins stay present on the field even when Tai is unconscious, and the area itself counts as “vein roots”. (Prof 18) Home’s Where The Heart Is - On Tai’s turns, she can choose to move the area up to 2 spaces away from its current position. Hardlight Landmarks made either within the boundaries or on the vein roots will follow with it. - Tai can take stamina cost for any of her allies’ abilities. Vein roots sprout through the ground in each cardinal direction starting from Tai’s current position, and they move along with her. If Tai is knocked unconscious, the vein roots disappear. (Prof 18) The Heart’s Where I Am - Any and all Stamina Costs Tai takes are reduced by one, she gains one DR, and she can choose to orient the Vein Roots to go in any directions around her she pleases. She may only reconfigure their positions during her turn. (Prof 18) Someplace I REALLY Wanna Be - All variations of Someplace I Wanna Be have new function(s) that Tai gets to use (which are added above)! She ALSO gains a new version:  - But My Heart Belongs To Those I Trust - Tai can choose to assign up to 2 others as having her vein roots, with them spreading 4 spaces in the cardinal directions around them. These units have advantage on dual-teching with each other and Tai, and if their Vein Roots are touching each other or Tai, they have a +4 to support each other."
passive,Tai,My Life As A Teenage-to-Young Adult Android,,,"Tai can produce gadgets or weapons from basically any part of her body to allow for communication, variable amounts of damage or other technological effects, etc.! When Tai uses these gadgets, she can choose to have them also manifest from a Hardlight Landmark or a vein root. Tai can either use a Bonus Action and/or a Main Action to make use of these. She can additionally change the elemental polarity of her Thermal Blade or the weapons from her body to be considered electrical, plasma/energy, or cold."
ability,Tai,Aortic Lifeline,2!,1,"At lightning fast speeds, Tai fires a wire from her arm into one of her vein roots, causing it to spring to life. Upon doing so, it can target an object or unit up to 2 spaces away from it, wrap itself around them, and throw them somewhere up to 7 spaces away from their current position. If something wrapped up in the vein root would take damage, Tai instead takes half of that damage (rounded up), and the wrapped up thing heals for the other half (rounded down). Once per round."
ability,Tai,For My Home,X,0,"Tai’s vein roots shimmer for a moment as they begin to draw in and/or expel energy. She can then take a property of any number of the objects/units standing on the vein roots and apply them onto either herself or another object/unit on the vein roots. Stamina cost is equal to the number of units/objects (excluding herself) involved in the ability usage, and potentially slightly more depending on the severity of what Tai is attempting to transfer."
ability,Tai,Hardlight Landmarks,3,1,"Tai taps into the spirit and life of those around her to create an Epithetical, 1x1 city structure in a space within three spaces of her current position. This structure acts as an immovable sentry that produces an effect/performs a particular action on adjacent units chosen by Tai during its construction. If a unit is standing on one of Tai’s vein roots, she can roll to have the effects of her structures activate on said unit (this can only occur once per turn). If one of these structures is directly on top of a vein root, its effectiveness is boosted. (Prof 16) Hardlight Projections - Tai’s Hardlight Landmarks provide a sense of wonder to herself and her allies. She can choose, when making a Landmark, to make it into a Sight or a Marker by paying an additional stamina. A Hardlight Sight makes a 2x2 landmark, but gives all adjacent allies a +2 to rolls on top of its usual effects due to being simply splendorous to be around. A Hardlight Marker is able to project its effects out 4 spaces away from it, but only to 1 person at a time as an anytime up to 3 times per round (usage is shared between Hardlight Markers)."

passive,Amicia,Undying Will,,0,"Amicia herself is probably the weakest of the Order of Virtues, but what she lacks in power she makes up for in fighting spirit! Whenever Amicia would be knocked out by an attack she may roll a d20. If the result is a 15+ she instead stabilizes at 5 stamina refusing to let the fight end."
ability,Amicia,Hero Of [Blank]!,3⛯,0,The Virtue of Courage is a decorated lineage. Amicia chooses and adopts the persona of one of her predecessors gaining benefits based on what they were the hero of. Roll 3 random words and choose 1. *Bonus points if you explain the lore of this particular hero.* Once Per Combat.

ability,Amicia,A Hero Never Falters!,0⛯,1,Amicia makes a short speech in a moment of crisis. This speech gives her time to rest and hardens her will to continue fighting. This ability heals Amicia for a base of 10 but can heal more based on the quality of her speech. Once Per Combat.

passive,Aperil,Hear No Evil,,0,"Aperil is deaf. Due to this, she is immune to all sound/sonic based effects. However, because of her Epithet, she produces a 2 space aura around her at all times, and all sound/sonic effects that make contact with the aura are negated. Whenever this happens, Aperil can choose to pay 1-2 stamina to take a negated effect and transfer it into herself. Then, as a once per round anytime action, she can attempt to apply the sound onto a chosen target/action to produce an effect based off of it onto them. Doing so plasters a word representing said sound on a physical object Aperil alters."
ability,Aperil,Do Ya’ll Hear Sumn?..,X!,0,"Aperil chooses action that is happening, and then makes it so it (or part of it) is sound based now. Stamina Cost is dependent on the severity of effect. Once per round."

talent,BAMF,I’m [Sweeping] Da Bomb!,,1,"At the start of combat, B.A.M.F.’s player opens up Minesweeper. B.A.M.F. is canonically doing this in their head while passively not doing anything. If they can complete it successfully (a screenshot must be sent to the DM), all of their abilities gain an incredible (very small) boost and they and their allies recover 1, or maybe even 2 stamina! Wow! What a blast! (Prof 14) PROCESSOR OPTION: RISK OF RAIN 2 - B.A.M.F.’s processor now has the option of using Risk Of Rain 2 as the main processing program for B.A.M.F.’s functionality. Instead of playing minesweeper the player of B.A.M.F. can instead play risk of rain 2. Passively this increases their movement speed by 1 but takes an extra point of damage from all sources. For every stage that they complete in between B.A.M.F.'s turns is tracked with as X. B.A.M.F. then gains a passive roll buff depending on the difficulty the player is playing on as well as the number of rounds that have passed. The buff is equal to X/2 if the player is on drizzle, X if the player is on rainstorm, 2X if the player is playing on monsoon. Whenever the player dies in Risk of Rain 2 they roll a d20 in game, the next time they die they roll again and If the player rolls underneath the previous roll something bad happens. If the player of B.A.M.F. Beats the game (not obliteration) in between his turns something special happens."
passive,BAMF,For The Greater Good,,0,"B.A.M.F. can be picked up by allies and tossed up to 6 spaces in any direction.

(Prof 12) You Exist I Guess - B.A.M.F, as a result of this upgrade, gets to exist!!! Wow!!! The things you get for existing include the ability to breathe in and out AND the ability to contemplate your existence using a whole round, but UH OH! Contemplating your existence might make you think harder than hard and make you explode in a 7x7 instead of a 5x5!!!"

It can be thrown anywhere within 4 spaces of B.A.M.F., and if it collides with a unit or another bomb, it instantly explodes.

passive,Evoa,Every Witch Needs a Familiar,,0,"A lot of mages can get familiars. Some get cats, some get owls, and others get more outlandish ones, like wolves or hedgehogs. Evoa’s is a cat! She named her Luci. Luci is a small black cat that Evoa can share her senses with and give small commands to (not that it listens 100% half the time anyway). It’s good at pickpocketing, scratching, being cute (which does need to be rolled for, but with a +20) and pretty much any other cat thing you could expect. Whenever Luci gets attacked, Evoa takes minor damage, but Luci somehow disappears and pops into Evoa’s clothes again."

Evoa adds another page to her spellbook based on the attack she just absorbed, often with a random/chaotic additional element to it. It can also copy effects that are affecting the battlefield, like a wild magic effect or the ground collapsing. Maybe weird shit, like something a player needs to do. Like rhyming. Once per Round."
ability,Evoa,Masks,3!,2,"Evoa reveals a mask of a teammate that she had, and puts it on, hiding behind something to conceal her as she comes out of the spot or hiding spot, looking like the ally that she had the mask of. This gives them their kit for as long as she wears the mask, with an upkeep of 2 per round.  Of note, she also has her kit but loses Luci as a summon. She can still transform her into objects if she’s taken Multifaceted. Evoa cannot get these kits permanently."
ability,Evoa,Multifaceted,2!,0,"All familiars usually have something based off of the mage’s epithet or set of spells, and Evoa’s is no exception! Using this ability, Evoa can transform Luci into pretty much anything, limited to nothing above about the size of the small kitten that Luci is. Anything from another animal, such as an owl or hedgehog (which has general effects and capabilities of said animal), or a hint more sparse, items. This being said, Luci does not like being an inanimate object for more than one round, if she’s used more than once in object form, she usually starts moving around as the object curves in odd ways, like a spell book page seeming to wave around or a gun barrel waving around like a tail. Luci doesn’t mind being a different animal. If used for an item that’s a one time use, the stamina cost is increased slightly, but Luci just pops back into Evoa’s cloak as always."

passive,GAMEMANIA,Continue?,,2,"As an arcade machine, Mania always has an answer to failure! You lost the game? Pay more money and try again! Whenever Mania fails an action, they can pay 1 max stamina to give themselves a reroll! They can attempt this multiple times per failed action, but each instance of doing this makes the cost go up by 1 stamina. They can also use this on allies’ failed actions, but that costs 2 max stamina. Max stamina resets to base at the end of a session."
ability,GAMEMANIA,Move List,X,1,"Mania chooses a target within 3 spaces and creates a cool, new, fighting game special move bound to a certain input. These inputs take the form of movement actions, and the special move can activate whenever the user moves in the assigned way as a free action. Moves can be assigned as 3 Space Quarter Circles (Forward and Back), 5 Space Half Circles (Forward and Back), 2 Space Down-Down Motions, 4 Space Charge Motions (3 Down/Up, 1 Forward/Back). The stamina cost for this move is dependent on the strength of the assigned special move, as is the cost for using the assigned special move."

ability,GAMEMANIA,"Beat 'Em Up, Guys!",3⛯,0,"Mania, with a flourish, produces up to 3 Atari 2600 style joysticks that act as summons! When summoned, Mania can place them on any space within 3 of them, and their movements mirror Manias. Each joystick has 5 stamina, and a 2 damage 2 range projectile basic attack. Once per combat."

weapon,Kasper,Crackle Shot,,0,"Psychic energy sparks off of Kasper’s body, as yellow-tinted TV Static emanates. He then fires off condensed psychokinetic energy as a projectile. 4 damage 4 range."
talent,Kasper,"Cool, Telekinesis",,0,"What some might call the “Psychic Standard”: Kasper can move things with his mind! Incredible. As a Bonus Action, he can move anything within 5 spaces of him up to 6 spaces away. Depending on the weight/size of the affected object, Kasper may need to pay stamina to do so."
talent,Kasper,Dungeon Master,,0,"For SOME reason, Kasper has a supernaturally good sense of direction and “logic” when traversing dungeons or dungeon like areas."
passive,Kasper,Fuzzy Static,,1,"Kasper’s psionic capabilities are partially rooted in the concept of “Mental Repression”. With a flare of his energy, fog creeps in, warping reality and making the world more muted. Whenever Kasper makes physical contact with someone/something, he can roll to inflict the touched thing with a stack of “Repress”. Upon being inflicted with Repress, Kasper is able to choose a kit aspect of the afflicted that he is aware of and remove up to 5 words of said aspect from its text. The afflicted loses the memory of the kit aspect variably based on what was taken, which will usually change its effect(s) at least slightly. Kasper, receiving flashes of memory from the afflicted, is then able to store the words that were repressed, able to apply them to himself and his actions for variable effects! If an afflicted target has no valid kit pieces to take from, Kasper may instead take minor properties from the afflicted. Each time an afflicted target gains 5 stacks of “Repress”, the kit piece of theirs that is the most repressed becomes completely Forgotten, and Kasper gains it until the end of combat. If there is a tie for “most repressed”, roll randomly. This effect also occurs if a kit piece is fully repressed outside of the intervals of 5. On his turn, Kasper can use a Bonus Action to touch an adjacent target with the intention of inflicting Repress. This does not require a roll on willing targets."
ability,Kasper,Squall Blanket,,1,"Kasper gives a smart-alec-y grin before extending his hands out to his sides. They glow a bright yellow before a blanket of energy erupts from behind Kasper. In a moment, a volley of up to 5 yellow hands come flying out, each able to zoom to anywhere within 3 spaces of Kasper. They can do anything that hands are able to, but if being used for damage, they deal 1-2 each. Kasper himself can run up to a target a hand is next to and perform Klose Kombat if he desires. When Kasper first initiates Squall Blanket, summoning the titular blanket, any unit within a 3x4 in front of him is unable to perceive anything occurring outside of that area, except for the created hands and anything Kasper specifically allows them to."
ability,Kasper,Memory Block,2!,1,"Suddenly, Kasper causes a wall of force to manifest up to 3 spaces away from him, appearing as a connected wall of hexagons wavering at the edges, yellow TV Static acting as a pattern throughout. As this wall of force makes contact with something, it acts as a barrier and causes the affected unit(s) and effects originating from them to slightly phase out of reality, becoming semi-corporeal for a moment. Once per Round."
ability,Kasper,Dull The Noise,X,1,"Kasper reaches out to an adjacent target, yellow energy pouring out of his hand and swathing them. This energy seeps into the target and drowns out an effect and/or property of Kasper’s choice, essentially nullifying it. This can be as simple as overwriting someone’s wounds to heal them or removing a blade’s sharpness, or potentially something more abstract/complex. This effect lasts a variable amount of time depending on roll, cost, and what exactly is being affected. Similarly, cost is dependent on severity."
weapon,Merlin,Bandit Sword,,0,"Merlin’s trademark cutlass! Perfect for the greatest Phantom Thief Cat Burglar! However, due to Merlin’s cognition that his entire body is seeping with Black Tar Heroin, and that his sword may as well be a part of him, this sword can forcefully inject a dose on rolls of 14+. 3 damage 1 range."
weapon,Merlin,Pachinko,,0,"Merlin’s packin’ heat in the form of a vicious slingshot. On rolls of 14+, the ammo will break on contact, causing a puff of Black Tar Smoke to infect the target, because as we all know, smoking drugs is bad. Only has 5 shots per session. 5 damage 5 range."
talent,Merlin,Proud Presence,,0,"The effects of Merlin’s and all of his allies’ healing abilities are increased! They all roll with a +3 modifier, and heal for 1 extra stamina. This helps to stave off Merlin’s crippling addiction, at least for a little bit."
passive,Merlin,Party Tactics,,1,"Merlin knows how to make the best of his enemies’ weaknesses, and he’ll make sure you know it too. Every crit he lands automatically makes hit units prone, and whenever he makes someone prone (via crit or otherwise), Merlin gets to take one more action. He can use this action himself, or Baton Pass the action to another ally, allowing them to take their own, powered up action. If all enemies are knocked prone at the same time, Merlin and his allies can perform an All-Out Attack, dealing everyone’s basic attack damage to all hit enemies."
ability,Merlin,2021 SuGaru Impreza,X,1,"Merlin and Zorro control the turbulent winds of fate and drug addiction! With this skill, he can cause a gust of wind to strike a target(s) of his choice! He can specify the strength of the magic, each tier costing a different amount of SP. Regardless of tier, this makes enemies prone if they have an inherent wind weakness, are hit while afflicted with a status (aside from Overdosed), or if this rolls a 17 or higher. For each target Morgana successfully hits in an action chain, the DC for making someone prone decreases by 2. - Garu: 3 SP - Deals 4 wind damage to one enemy. - Magaru: 8 SP - Deals 4 wind damage to all enemies. - Garula: 6 SP - Deals 7 wind damage to one enemy. - Magarula: 14 SP - Deals 7 wind damage to all enemies. - Garudyne: 10 SP - Deals 10 wind damage to one enemy. - Magarudyne: 20 SP - Deals 10 wind damage to all enemies."
ability,Merlin,Dia/Patra My Balls,X,2,"Now that Merlin has faced the consequences of his actions, he now tries to instill healthier lifestyles onto his comrades. With this skill, he is able to tap into the spring of human happiness and heal/cure the status effects of a target(s) of his choice. He can specify the strength of the magic, each tier costing a different amount of SP.  - Dia: 3 SP - Heals one target for 3 stamina. - Media: 7 SP - Heals all allies for 3 stamina - Diarama: 6 SP - Heals one target for 6 stamina. - Mediarama: 12 SP - Heals all allies for 6 stamina. - Patra: 4 - Cures all negative status effects/debuffs for one ally. - Me Patra: 8 Cures all negative status effects/debuffs for all allies."
ability,Merlin,Lucky Punch,1,0,"Much like the financial sucker punch of being addicted to Black Tar Heroin, Merlin can deliver a potentially devastating strike using Zorro. This produces a cartoonish boxing glove that deals 1 damage to a unit within Morgana’s movement speed, and has an expanded crit range of 13-20."
weapon,Murdle,Shield Shell Toss,,0,"Sheldon grasps onto Murdle like a frisbee before tossing him at a chosen target. The attack has 3 range and deals 5 damage, and Murdle will then boomerang back towards Sheldon unless this attack rolls 8 or less (after roll boosts)."

passive,Murdle,Shell Servant,,0,"Upon leaving to participate in DBA, Silica created a demonic specter that acts as a butler with the task of assisting Murdle. This butler, affectionately referred to as Sheldon, carries Murdle around and essentially allows him to act as an average build human under most circumstances. Sheldon is unable to take damage, allowing Murdle to completely avoid any sort of grounded attack/obstacle so long as he is being held. If Murdle and Sheldon are ever separated, Sheldon is able to perform either a 5 damage basic attack or other simple actions on his turn(s) until the two are reunited."
ability,Murdle,Turtle Pinball,2!,1,"Murdle retracts into his shell, transforming him into the deadliest item this side of the riverbed. Any attacks that hit him while in this form have their damage significantly reduced, and any force that comes into contact with him launches him in the direction of said force. From here, Murdle essentially becomes a shell pinball, able to bounce off of walls and rebound into opponents to deal 4 damage per hit. Sheldon is able to launch Murdle with a non-damaging kick, which can be initiated upon activation of this ability if Murdle wishes. Once per round."
ability,Murdle,Cowabunga!,1,0,"Harnessing the spirit of certain turtle brethren, Murdle changes the color of his scales to produce a chosen effect. The same effect cannot be used two rounds in a row. - If Murdle turns blue, he gives advantage to a unit's next roll. - If Murdle turns red, he increases the damage of a unit's next attack. - If Murdle turns orange, he increases something’s/someone’s movement via skateboard. - If Murdle turns purple, the size and/or range of a chosen thing increases."
ability,Murdle,"Get Down, Mr. President!",1!,1,"As something comes towards Murdle, an ally, or another given object, Murdle proves why he’s a spatial anomaly by throwing a strange key towards it. If an object gets near the key, it is transported inside a small pocket dimension within a gem on the key’s base, and each time Murdle uses this he takes 1 stamina of cost. However, as a once per combat action, he can then release everything that he has stored at once to create a giant wave of objects and effects. Once per round for the key toss, while the once per combat is a main action."
ability,Murdle,Genbu Galactica,3⛯,0,"After a brief spark in Murdle’s eyes, his form begins to morph. He grows to a 5x5 size, and the top of his shell is decorated with a landscape/environment of his choice. Depending on the environment he chooses, his actions are modified to fit the new theme and anyone who chooses (or is forced) to ride on his back are affected in specific ways. Sheldon pilots him, and his “Snapping Turtle” basic attack instead deals 7 damage. If he so desires, Murdle can revert back to normal form on his turn as a free action. Once per combat."
weapon,Scoville,Blackstar Fighting Style,,0,"Scoville has his own particular fighting style in which he just strings together hand-to-hand combat with underhanded tactics and improvised weapons. Deals 5 damage at 1 range. On rolls of 17 or higher, this can apply debuffs if what he's doing could logically apply one. He can spend 2 points of Shell Density to apply a guaranteed poison status that deals 1d2 damage at the end of the target’s turn. (Prof 26) Greasy Boye - Blackstar Fighting Style’s poison status now deals 1d3 damage (increased from 1d2)."
weapon,Scoville,Arven,,1,"A massive electric guitar with a sleek, angular design that Scoville uses in his performances, he can rock out with it or tune it to give himself or an ally within 3 spaces a bonus to their rolls. If he wants, he can smash it on something adjacent to deal 10-15 damage and render it useless for the rest of the session."
talent,Scoville,Shiny Shell,,0,"While Scoville has at least 1 point of DR, anyone who attacks him gains a poison status that deals 1d2 damage at the start of their turns."
passive,Scoville,Chitin-Clad Charger,,2,"Scoville’s body has a chitinous exoskeleton that he can grow and recede at well (Urchin relations for the win am I right?!). He has a red stat that refers to the density of his exoskeleton, which gets shed or added to as he uses abilities. He has a max of 10, and for every 5 points in his red stat gains 1 DR against physical attacks. He gains 1 to his Shell Density every time he gets hit by an attack, as his body naturally adapts to the damage he’s taking. If someone specifically targets his shell with a powerful attack, then they can break parts of it off and reduce his red stat’s current number. (Prof 20) Blitzkrieg’s Backbone! - Scoville’s Shell Density now increases his DR towards a type of damage of his choice by 1 per 2 points within it and no longer reduces his movement. It also goes up for every separate instance of damage (so multihits now proc it multiple times). On top of this, he can now spend Shell Density on anything to either apply poison, increase the die size on poison, or add to rolls all at a 2:1 ratio. (Prof 26) Greasy Boye - When Scoville’s shell gets going, he starts to ooze poison from his spines. When at 5 Shell Density or higher, he can choose to leave his poison wherever he moves and even spread it through attacks innately! Anyone who starts or ends their turn on a poison square takes the effects of his basic attack poison. Additionally, each time he reaches an interval of 5 Shell Density, each of Scoville’s Main Actions gain a “Combo Charge”. When an action has a Combo Charge, he can expend it to combo into its correlating action from another action. Scoville cannot use the same action more than once in a turn with this Passive."
passive,Scoville,Intoxicating Rockstar,,1,"Any poison that Scoville applies can affect anything regardless of if it logically shouldn't be able to. Additionally, it can either be set to be sticky or caustic. If sticky, they reduce the target’s movement by the roll made for their effect alongside the usual debuff and being able to stick things together. If caustic, the effects of the poison worsen every time they tick, with the dice size increasing by one at the start of every one of the affected unit’s turns on top of being able to melt through things as tough as steel. Sticky poison takes a move or main action to try and purge while caustic poison can be purged on a usual free action roll at the start of someone’s turn, both with rolls of 10+ being able to cure it. Poison applied by Urchin’s Blast has a DC of 15+ instead. The DCs go down by 2 every time they fail."
ability,Scoville,Urchin Blast,2,0,"Scoville flourishes his hair, causing the two horn-like tips to launch globs of venom at a pair of targets within 4 spaces. This venom can either be very sticky or very caustic, but it usually does around 3-4 damage each and applies a poison debuff that reduces a target's rolls by 1d4 for their next turn. Infected targets can roll to remove it as a free action. Multiple stacks of the debuff increase how long the poison lasts, it does not increase the amount of d4s rolled."
ability,Scoville,Roll-Out Riot,3,0,"Scoville cracks his knuckles before curling up and using his shell to roll incredibly quickly in one direction. This roll goes up to 8 spaces away and increases his Shell Density by 3. If he runs into something, it’s almost guaranteed to be knocked prone and take 8 damage. He can, however, trade the damage for knockback. On rolls of 15+, the target is inflicted with a poison status that reduces their rolls by 1d2."
ability,Scoville,Venom Dynamite Starburst,5,1,"Scoville begins a performance that will absolutely rock the house, and by ‘the house’ I mean a 4x6 area in front of him. The targets in the area become trapped in a dense fog as Scoville’s band quickly sets up a stage and performs alongside him. If he has Arven unbroken, then he begins the show with a loud shred of the opening notes which makes it harder to interrupt (and plays his crit theme!) before going to town on the people in the area, bursting his shell completely as he smashes his guitar into the crowd, dealing 7-13 damage. Once he’s done, he leaves the stage behind and continues what he’s doing. At the end of Scoville’s next turn, however, the stage detonates in a fiery cloud of poisonous smoke. This causes all enemies within 2 spaces of the stage to be knocked back 4 spaces and take a poison debuff that reduces their rolls for the turn by a 1d4+1. This poison usually lasts more than one round unless there are special utilities used to be rid of it. This sets his Shell Density to zero and breaks his guitar if it is previously unbroken. (Prof 24) 24/7 Concert Setup - Scoville’s crew is really good at setting up stages in a relatively short amount of time! Venom Dynamite Starburst’s area increases to a 4x6 (from 2x3) with the attack’s damage increasing by 1 per Shell Density Scoville possesses. Additionally, when the stage detonates, it now doesn’t hurt or poison allies. The stage setup is so quick that even if Scoville rolls a Natural 1 on Venom Dynamite Starburst, it still shows up! But, the catch is that the Middle School Band hijacks it and plays their shitty brass solo, dealing 6 cringe damage to literally everyone in the combat even if they’re deaf because their music is so bad it (metaphorically) harms your soul."
ability,Scoville,Shield of Spines,1!,1,"Scoville can use this when an attack would be coming at him or an ally within 4 spaces to move however he likes to intercept the attack with his body! This reduces the damage by half at the very minimum and gives him a +2 Shell Density. If he ends up adjacent to someone, he can put his poison on them to either give them the debuff from Blackstar Fighting Style or allow their weapon to apply it on hit for their next 3 attacks. Once per Round."
weapon,Vanta,Edge of The Night,,0,A dagger that is completely black and seems to suck in any light around it. No shadows can be visibly seen (It’s Vanta Black colored). 5 damage 1 range. Vanta's dagger can be thrown at an enemy from a distance! On high rolls the dagger stays in the person. This is affected by her passive. She has multiple daggers. This deals 3 damage at 4 range.
weapon,Vanta,THE SOUUUUUUL REAVER,,0,Vanta carries around a gun with her. She only uses it when she is on the job or if a situation requires her to use it. The gun is of course blackened as well as the bullets inside. Deals 4 damage at 6 range. When she shoots an enemy she can use an anytime action to teleport to the bullet and follow up the attack with a slash with her dagger dealing 3 damage. The second part of the weapon can be used whether she misses or not.
talent,Vanta,Black is the New Black,,0,"Vanta is extremely into fashion. She likes to match with the rest of the party too. So instead of changing her clothes like a normal person, she has a bunch of stockpiled clothes for any size of individual so everyone can have matching black outfits. These outfits are affected by Vanta’s epithet, allowing her to use her abilities and passive on allies."
passive,Vanta,The Blackest Night,,1,"Using her epithet, Vanta is able to turn objects a pitch black. When an object has been “blackened”, she is able to manipulate it to a certain extent. She can’t change the original composition of the object but she can manipulate it as if she’s working with clay. She cannot blacken organic materials. There is no limit to the amount of items she can have blackened. As a twice per round, 0 cost anytime action, she can blacken an object within 20ft of her or 10ft of another blackened object. She is able to teleport to blackened objects providing she is touching a blackened object herself. The object she uses to teleport is left behind. To use teleportation, Vanta sacrifices half her movement. If the object is quite large, where on it she teleports is random. She is also able to see and hear through blackened objects that she is aware of the location of or one she has put extra care into. (ex: some of RTSL’s tools or weapons) All items unblacken at the end of combat unless Vanta has specifically put time into it. (Prof 20) The Black Plague - If a blackened item would touch another object that could potentially be blackened and is within Vanta's eyesight, Vanta is able to, as an unrolled effect, immediately blacken said item. There is a cost which is variable and determined by the GM, typically 2 at a baseline."
ability,Vanta,Can’t Even Trust Your Own Shadow,2,0,"Vanta throws one of her daggers at an enemy, missing on purpose. Once the dagger gets behind the target she teleports to it and stabs it into their back, dealing 6 damage. Once the dagger breaks through the target’s clothing she uses her epithet to meld the dagger and clothing together making it incredibly difficult to take the dagger out. She tells people that she’s teleporting to their shadow but she really isn't. This can be flavored to come from any direction."
ability,Vanta,The Darkest of Swaps,1!,1,"Vanta concentrates and manipulates her epithet to an impressive degree causing two blackened objects, and anything they are connected to in the same tile, to swap positions. Once per round."
ability,Vanta,Unleashing My Inner Demons,0,0,"Vanta channels her epithet into her own body to manipulate it. She then can take on the attributes of 3 of her blackened items that are within 5 spaces of her to manipulate her physique, giving her bonuses or new attacks she can utilize."
weapon,Zell,Blazing Chief,,0,"Zell’s pride and joy: a sword they constructed themselves using the remains of three other swords, scrap metal, and a high power engine. This resulted in a light brown, steampunk monster of a weapon that is only able to be wielded as efficiently as it is due to Zell’s vampire enhanced physical strength. Deals 6 damage at 3 range. Blazing Chief has cleaving properties inherently. (Prof 27) Burn Baby Burn - On rolls of 14+, Blazing Chief inflicts 2 Stacks of Burn (as per Zell’s Jack State)."
talent,Zell,Elemental Bending - Pyrokinesis,,0,"Typically, it is the eldest of vampires that gain the power to bend a particular element. However, despite their youth, Zell seems to be a natural when it comes to manipulating fire. They have the power to create and bend fire to a limited extent as a Bonus Action on their turn, and add it to other actions they perform for small bonus effects."
talent,Zell,Scrapyard Mechanic,,0,"Zell is pretty good with metalworking and engineering, at least when it comes to utilizing scrap and spare metal in a “steampunk” style. Not only do they have advantage on rolls to understand, utilize, or repair machinery, but they are also able to use their skills to modify metalworks to their liking. Given the right materials, they may be able to upgrade weapons and the like (permanently or otherwise), or create other small, simple devices."
passive,Zell,Exceed Engine,,2,"The defining feature of Blazing Chief is the massive engine protruding out of the blade near its crossguard. The grip can be twisted, revving this engine and further infusing Zell’s flames into it, powering up the blade and making its slashes all the more explosive. Zell can spend any portion of their Movement Action(s), converting the amount of spaces used into an equivalent amount of Rev Stacks, with every 5 Rev Stacks setting them into a different “Blade State”. They can also attempt to rev Blazing Chief whenever they successfully perform an action, with a normal success granting 1 Rev Stack, rolling within 1 of the number rolled for the initial action granting 3 Rev Stacks, and rolling the same number as the initial action or a Natural 20 grants 5 Rev Stacks. When not on a multiple of 5 Rev Stacks, they lose 1 stack every other turn. If knocked out, they lose 5 stacks every other turn. If Zell double moves, they cannot use the second movement to gain Rev Stacks. Zell’s Blade States, in order, are Jack State at 5 Stacks, Queen State at 10 Stacks, the choice of Jack or Queen State at 15 Stacks, and King State at 20 Stacks. Each State has Zell assume a different fighting style, granting them different passive boons, variations of their abilities, and a special “Inferno Ender”: an attack only accessible when in a particular state that, while powerful, reduces Zell’s Rev Stacks to 0. - When in Jack State, Zell begins funneling greater amounts of fire into Blazing Chief to really kickstart their flow. Wielding Blazing Chief with an inverse grip, a small torrent of flame flares up around them. They gain a 5ft aura that decreases enemy damage by 1 and increases ally damage by 1, and all of their damaging actions inflict a Burn Status on hit targets, dealing 1 damage to them at the start of their turn. Inferno Ender - Ring of Fire (4) - Zell stabs Blazing Chief into the ground with great force, causing a tornado of fire to whirl to life around them. It covers a 5x5 area with them at its center, where all allies inside gain a +2 to damage on their next attack, and all enemies take an initial 3-5 damage. Along with this, all units affected by this attack catch fire with an “Ethereal Flame”. These deal no damage, but allow Zell to manipulate the flames along with a burning unit’s body as a once per round Bonus Action on their turn, as well as a separate once per round Anytime Action. This cannot be used two rounds in a row. - When in Queen State, Zell uses bursts of flame to grant them increased mobility and acrobatic capabilities, utilizing Blazing Chief as a momentum shifting weight. They gain +3 movement (which cannot be used for Revving), can move-act-move, and attacks specifically targeting them roll with a -2. Inferno Ender - Wildfire Charge (5) - A pulse of energy is expelled from Zell as they charge towards an enemy within 5 spaces of them. Upon reaching them, they use momentum to the fullest to perform a massive swing of Blazing Chief, dealing 6-7 damage to the hit unit. After this occurs, they use the hit unit as a springboard, sending the unit up to 3 spaces in any direction, and themselves flying towards another unit within 5 spaces of them. If this unit is an enemy, Zell attacks them as they did the first unit. If this unit is an ally, they can springboard off of them towards another unit within 5 spaces, increasing the damage of the next slash they deal in this chain while doing so. They can continue this chain a maximum of four times, and they are guaranteed to at least be able to attempt up to two, even if they fail one of them. If a single unit is attacked multiple times in a chain, the damage of subsequent slashes is proliferated over time. - When in King State, both Zell’s body and Blazing Chief begin radiating a vibrant, fiery, orange glow as Zell wields Blazing Chief with both hands. They gain a +4 to non-ability damage, all of their attacks deal minor explosion/splash damage to nearby enemies, and their actions are armored, unable to be stopped by terrain or interrupts, only dodged. Inferno Ender - Ravager Nova (6) - Putting all of their power and rage into one, massive, overhead swing of Blazing Chief, Zell slams the sword into the ground. This cracks the earth, producing a monstrously powerful, 7x7 explosion of flame in front of them that deals 15-20 damage to all units inside as they are sent flying up to 6 spaces in any direction. The area the explosion occurred in remains a charred crater, acting as difficult terrain for all enemies and dealing 1d3+2 fire damage to all enemies who start their turn in the area. Any fire based effects are bolstered if they originate in, enter, or pass through this area, and Zell and their allies have a +1 to all damage while inside the area. Upon using this ability, Zell and Blazing Chief are worn out, constantly emanating a massive cloud of steam, making it so Zell takes +3 damage and cannot gain any Rev Stacks until the end of their next turn. Once per Combat. (Prof 25) Let's Get This Party Started - When combat begins, Zell glares at their opponents and immediately begins revving their monstrous blade in preparation for the coming fray. They start the combat with Rev stacks equal to their initiative divided by 5, rounded up. (5-9 = 1, 10-14 = 2, 15-19 = 3, 20 = 4). They cannot gain more than 4 Rev stacks with this upgrade under any circumstances. If they gain 4 Rev with this upgrade, their movement is doubled for their first turn."
ability,Zell,Blood Driver,3,0,"Assuming a low stance for an instant, Zell zooms forward up to 2 spaces, scraping Blazing Chief against the ground and producing flaming sparks as they perform a massive horizontal slash. This deals 4-7 damage to all enemies in a 3x4 area in front of their starting position, and they are afflicted with up to 3 spaces of knockback. For each unit hit by this attack, a blood construct bat is left in the space they were hit in. These bats have 4 movement, and can be absorbed by Zell or one of their allies to gain a choice of either +1 to rolls for the next 1d2 rounds or a property of the unit it was made from that can augment one action of the absorber’s choice. Jack State (3) - Zell first produces a wave of fire in front of them, before then slashing the wave with Blazing Chief, causing a volley of three fireballs to blast from it. These fireballs can travel up to 8 spaces away, dealing 3-4 damage to enemies they collide with, inflicting up to 5 spaces of knockback if desired. Enemies hit by this are afflicted with two Burn Status stacks instead of one (this is not increased if one unit is hit by more than one fireball), and gain their own instance of Zell’s Jack State aura. This aura can be stacked with Zell’s own. Queen State (3) - Zell performs a thrusting stinger with Blazing Chief, dashing in an up to 10 space line. This deals 4-7 damage to all enemies hit, and they are dragged to the space in front of Zell in the process, knocked prone. A trail of fire is left across the spaces Zell traveled across, which reach up 20 ft in the air. If an enemy passes through these flames, they take 1d3 + 1 damage, which passes through mundane DR. King State (5) - Blazing Chief erupts with tremendous force as Zell reels back. After a moment, they rocket forward, spinning rapidly with Blazing Chief extended outward. They travel in a 5-6 space line, dragging all enemies within 2 spaces of their position along with them in the process. This deals up to 6 damage to all enemies hit, with higher damage amounts being dealt the earlier a unit was dragged into the attack. After Zell has finished moving forward, they perform one final spin slash, dealing an additional 8-9 damage to all enemies within 3 spaces of them and sending them flying in directions of Zell’s choice, dealing explosive splash damage to adjacent enemies when they land. If an enemy was hit by the initial dash, they are unable to interrupt/negate the final slash, and Zell will always be able to hit them unless they roll a Natural 1."
ability,Zell,Burning Pledge,3,0,"Targeting a unit within the range of Burning Chief (which can be themselves), Zell performs an upward slash, producing a pillar of flaming wind that engulfs the target. If targeting an enemy, this deals Blazing Chief’s damage -1, passing through Physical DR and knocking the enemy skyward. Zell can follow them into the air if they desire and, if they do, they can pay another 2 stamina to perform a follow-up basic attack with half damage (before modifiers). Regardless of whether or not the follow-up occurs, the next attack the target is hit by has its damage increased by 1. If an adjacent enemy has successfully dealt at least 5 damage to Zell within the past round, they can give a separate roll to attempt to attack them along with the initial target. If targeting an ally, the flame pillar empowers their will. This grants them the choice of +3 movement, +1 damage, or minor lifesteal, and the ability to incorporate extra fire and speed based effects to their actions for the next round. If Zell has at least 5 Companionship with an adjacent ally that is not the initial target of this ability, they can give a separate roll to attempt to grant them these buffs to this unit along with the initial target. Jack State (3) - Zell causes a whirlwind of flame to kick up in the 3x3 area surrounding them, coating all adjacent units in the fire. Hit enemies take 1d2 damage initially, along with a minus to their next roll equal to the damage roll. Hit allies are healed for 1 and are able to Basic Attack any of the targeted enemies, regardless of whether or not they were damaged/affected by the original attack. Zell is then able to perform follow-up basic attacks of their own on each of the enemies that were successfully attacked by an ally. Queen State (3) - Zell dashes in a circle, specifically around 15ft of the space they started this action in. From there, they can choose to target enemies or allies. If targeting enemies, all enemies inside are caught up in a tornado of fire, dealing 3 damage as they are sent flying into the air. From there, Zell zooms up above them, performing a helmsplitter that sends them flying back down to the ground. This deals another 3-4 damage, inflicts up to 3 spaces of knockback in any direction, and knocks hit units prone. If targeting allies, uplifting, fiery winds overtake them, granting them all an additional Movement Action, granting them minor flight capabilities, and allowing them to flavor their actions as faster for the next round. King State (5) - With a massive upward swing, Zell produces a fiery explosion in a 3x3 area within Blazing Chief’s range. All enemies within this area take 7-9 damage as they are sent flying in the air, and from there, Zell can choose to pay another 1 stamina to perform a follow-up basic attack with slightly reduced damage (before modifiers) on one of the hit enemies. All allies within the area are filled with a burning passion, giving their next attack a 1.5x damage modifier, and they can incorporate extra fire effects into their actions for the next round."
ability,Zell,Dancing In The Dark,X!,1,"Zell’s eyes flash before they shift their form into a strange mixture of bat swarm and condensed, black mist in a humanoid form. They can move up to 3 spaces in any direction, able to phase through objects and/or units due to their misty form. At the same time, the bat portion of them can arrange themselves into any formation within this ability’s 3 space range, able to perform a quick attack alongside Zell’s mist form performing a slash with Blazing Chief. The damage/effects of these attacks are dependent on the exact formation taken along with the stamina cost spent, but if nothing else, a slash from Blazing Chief in this form typically deals 3-4 rather than its usual damage (before modifiers). Once per Round. Jack State (2!) - Zell produces a swarm of fiery bats that form a 3x3 wall in a chosen location within 4 spaces of Zell, able to protect them and allies from incoming attacks. After an attack hits the wall, the bats scatter in a storm of flame, moving over to and damaging the initiator(s) of the attack for 1d3 damage. By paying an additional stamina, the area the fire wall was first summoned in now grants the effects of Jack State’s Passive Aura. Queen State (1 + X!) - Zell’s body shifts to mist condensed to a humanoid form, which has sprouted large, fiery bat wings. Zell can immediately move anywhere within their movement speed, and while doing so, can grab onto one unit they pass adjacent to if they desire. This drags the unit along with Zell, and if this unit is an enemy, Zell can follow this up with a number of 1d2 damage slashes equal to the amount of stamina paid for this ability. Knockback up to the amount of stamina is also inflicted. King State (5!) - As an attack approaches Zell, they shift to a pure-black, misty form. The only thing more than a silhouette is their eyes, burning a fervent orange. They then parry whatever attack this was initiated in response to, slashing back with Blazing Chief as it sets completely ablaze. This deals damage equal to 1.5x what Zell would have taken from the original attack, causing the hit unit to be blasted away in the process. If Zell desires, they can choose for the initial counterattack to only deal 5-6 damage, instead producing 3 or more massive, fiery bats that can fly to a space within 5 of Zell’s current position. Zell can divy up the damage the counterattack would have done to each of the bats, and when they collide with an enemy, they explode and deal that much damage to them. These bats cannot initially be placed on top of the enemy that triggered this ability’s activation. Once per Combat."

He can only change a specific number a certain way once in the combat. For instance, if he was to try and multiply a specific ally’s damage on their standard attack by 2, then he wouldn’t be able to multiply that ally’s standard attack damage again for the rest of the combat.

weapon,W,The Goop of Gods,,0,"Even though W’s a bucket, he’s still a god! Thus, he can fill the hole within himself with shadow realm goop which can be tossed upon opponents. 6 damage 3 range. Low rolls will cover less range and tip you over, and he can't get up without assistance. This does not apply if an ally assists him in throwing the goop by carrying you. Once covered, opponents will take damage and he can apply reality-warping effects on them."

passive,W,"This World Is Mine, W",,2,"The longer W remains in combat, the more and more that the area becomes part of the Shadowrealm. As the Shadowrealm takes dominion, W becomes stronger, and if the Shadowrealm ever engulfs the whole field, he gains the full extent of his godly power. However, due to his... current state, this effect is slower."
ability,W,Chaotic Cacophany,5⛯,2,"Letting a small portion of his full power loose, W can unleash a wave of pure shadow and carnage in a 5x5 radius out from underneath himself. This not only dazes any hit unit, afflicting them with confusion, but also creates a shadow clone of them that work for W. These clones have 12 stamina each, and otherwise possess the same sheet as their base character. Once per combat."

ability,W,Boop! Banished!,3,1,"W shoots out a ball of dark energy that, when it comes into contact with anything, expands into a small void leading directly to the Shadowrealm. Getting trapped in here not only deals variable damage, but allows W to inflict any effect of his choice onto the unit."
weapon,Zyonna,Deadly Technique,,0,"5 damage 1 range. Zyonna takes advantage of her impressive raw strength and agility to attack a chosen unit. This usually takes the form of a martial technique or Zyonna honing her hand into a claw to slash at someone. If this attack is successful and did not have Precision Stacks invoked, add 1d3 of Precision onto the hit unit."
weapon,Zyonna,Weighted Yo-Yo,,0,"It took pulling some strings to get this weapon made especially for you. It deals 6 damage at 3 range, and knocks hit targets up to 1 space in any direction or knocks them prone (assuming the target is 4x4 or smaller). However, this yo-yo spends Precision to increase its knockback, and cannot be used to increase its damage."
weapon,Zyonna,Razor Wires,,0,"Extremely thin wires which can easily slice through human skin. While this can be used as a basic attack to deal 1 damage and inflict 3 Bleed stacks at 1 range, that’s not its primary purpose. As a Bonus Action, Zyonna may leave some of the wire floating in the air where she is. Upon doing this at least twice, she may, as a Main Action, cause the wire to “snap” back, dealing 8 damage, inflicting 3 Bleed, and inflicting 1d4+1 Precision stacks on everyone within the shape defined while connecting the dots of wire left behind."
talent,Zyonna,Vital Scan,,0,"Zyonna is able to gauge the health of others with extreme accuracy. She/Her Player is able to know the exact stamina totals of enemies, or at the very least close to accurate estimations."
passive,Zyonna,Killing Blow,,1,"Every move you make matters, so make sure you finish your kill decisively. No uncertainty. Mess up, and there’s a good chance you’re dead. Zyonna has had this drilled into her head for as long as she can remember. As such, she goes for one-hit kills whenever possible. Various parts of Zyonna’s kit inflict stacks of “Precision” onto affected units. When performing an attack on a unit with Precision on them, Zyonna can choose to invoke the stacks to add damage equal to the number of stacks onto the attack. This must be stated before a roll is made, and if the attack fails, Zyonna will lose varying amounts of Precision. If the attack is successful, all stacks of Precision are removed, unless the attack knocks the unit out. In which case, they will ALWAYS have an absolute minimum of 3 Precision Stacks on them (which carries between Combats and Sessions) unless Zyonna forgets them and their capabilities. If Zyonna did not attack a given unit on her turn, one of her allies attacks that unit, and she can see this occur, she can roll to attempt to gain varying amounts of Precision on them. Zyonna can use a Full Turn Action to place 1d3+4 stacks of Precision on a unit. - 3 Precision on Eileen Wonderland - 3 Precision on Balthasar Reid (Prof 29) Defensive Patience - Whenever an attack would hit Zyonna, if the attacker has Precision Stacks, she may spend those stacks to decrease the roll of the attack by spending Precision Stacks. This requires no roll, but only works to protect herself as she dodges. So for example, if an AoE would hit her and an ally, this would only decrease the roll when it comes to hitting her, and the action would still resolve and hit her allies."
passive,Zyonna,Survival Instinct,,0,"While at half stamina and below, Zyonna goes into a defensive trance. She must now prioritize all defensive anytimes and actions to be solely towards protecting herself. However, in return she gains +3 movement and inflicts +1 Precision stacks on all actions that would inflict them."
ability,Zyonna,Shadow Step,X,0,"Taking in a deep breath and properly stancing herself, Zyonna begins walking at an exact speed. This ability is combined with Zyonna’s movement. For every step Zyonna takes, she pays 1 stamina, which produces an afterimage of her. If she passes an enemy while doing this, Zyonna can choose to basic attack them, utilizing any number of her afterimages to disorient the enemy and give her a variable bonus to her roll. Hitting with this basic attack grants an additional 2 stacks of Precision. If any afterimages remain after her movement is complete, they remain on the field until attacked or the end of her next turn. When attacking Zyonna or an afterimage, an enemy must roll 1dX (X = Zyonna + the number of Afterimages on the field), and on the highest result they hit the real Zyonna. Otherwise, an afterimage is targeted and fades away on contact. If this occurs, the enemy gains Precision Stacks roughly equal to the amount of damage they would have dealt to Zyonna (unless their attack would have dealt no damage, in which case they receive 1d2 stacks). They can then take a different main action, although at half effectiveness (this does not apply if an action other than a main action is used to dispel an afterimage). "
ability,Zyonna,Dislocation Point,2,1,"Zyonna dashes to a target within her movement at blinding speeds, essentially teleporting to them as she performs a particularly forceful jab. This typically deals around 3-6 damage to a hit unit, afflicts them with 1d2 Precision Stacks, and Zyonna can choose to instantly dash back to her starting position if she so chooses. The area she struck is now marked as a “Dislocation Point”, and Zyonna can, as a Once per Round per Point anytime action, cause whatever was struck to wildly dislocate. This may damage an affected unit, add 1d3 Precision Stacks, and/or cause an action they are performing to be interrupted providing the dislocation would cause that. If one of Zyonna’s allies strikes a Dislocation Point on an enemy, the enemy gains 1d2 extra Precision Stacks, and if Zyonna strikes a Dislocation Point, she deals +1d3 damage and gains 1d4+1 stack of Precision on them. This ability can be used on objects and structures to cause them to break on command. If Zyonna uses this ability on herself, she takes no damage, and this can be used as a Bonus Action."
ability,Zyonna,Sixth Sense,3!,1,"This ability has two variations dependent on whether or not it was used in response to an incoming attack. If used in response to an incoming attack, time seems to slow for Zyonna as she perceives her surroundings in a 3x3 around her in an instant. This allows her to perform an action in retaliation. This action grants extra Precision if it is successful. If Zyonna only uses a movement action, this ability only costs 1 stamina and gives her 1 Precision on the unit who initiated the attack this ability was used in response to. If used without an attack prompting it, Zyonna begins to hyper-analyze a target she can see. At this point, Zyonna begins thinking through a potential interaction between her and this unit. This takes the form of a “Hypothetical Battle”, where Zyonna and the unit each take one turn fighting each other and exclusively each other. The other unit can only use actions that Zyonna has seen them use before, and as this fight is only imaginary, therefore it does not actually affect the units involved. While in this combat, Zyonna tries her hardest to dissect the other units’ movements and learn how they work. If she proves successful in this endeavor, she will gain roll buffs against that unit and/or Precision Stacks on that unit proportional to how well she “learned” to fight against them. Once per Round. (Prof 32) Subconscious Dexterity - Sixth Sense’s reactionary variation can now be used against attacks that she isn’t aware of or that she can’t normally react to either because of speed or mental fuckery, as her combat instincts are honed to the extreme. Its standalone variation is a guaranteed success against enemies who she’s gained minimum Precision Stacks on with Killing Blow."
ability,Zyonna,Counter Strategy,X,0,"You were always taught to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. Using this ability, you may spend X stamina and double X in Precision Stacks to devise a technique especially designed to counter their gameplan. Note that this only allows you to utilize things you’re already capable of: it does not grant you new powers, but rather hones your existing ones in a way that works against your target. Can be used to make abilities or passives. Abilities created with this cost no stamina and passives require a 1 stamina upkeep. The power of the technique is relative to the roll and how much stamina/Precision Stacks were spent. Bonus Action."
weapon,Lavin,Flow Gear,,0,"When all else fails, Lavin always has his martial arts prowess to fall back on. Despite his large stature, he is surprisingly nimble, producing swathes of ink-like-energy as trails following his body during his attacks. This basic attack passes through most forms of DR, and, if he holds his action to use this basic attack, he is able to use it to deflect/reflect most attacks that come his way. 8 damage 1 range."
weapon,Lavin,Pure Sight,,0,"Lavin extends his palm, producing an eye on it that begins charging a laser beam once it makes eye contact with a target. Once this target breaks eye contact with the eye, it fires the projectile, dealing variable damage depending on how long they were looking at it. The longer they were looking at it, the more damage it deals to them. If Lavin is adjacent to someone when they break eye contact, he is able to capitalize on the opportunity to perform another main action, regardless of what turn it is. Bonus Action. Optic Orb - If he desires, and if Lavin does not use his movement action to move on his turn, he can manifest an orb of pink-purple energy from the eye he produces on his hand. This orb, 2x2 in size, is then thrown at a target that Lavin can see, not affected by gravity in the slightest. This deals around 5-6 damage at base, but Lavin can funnel his stamina into it to have it deal more. If the target closes their eyes, the ball disappears, reappearing when their eyes are reopened, its trajectory redirected towards them."
talent,Lavin,Pledge Statement,,1,"Whenever Lavin takes an action, he can choose to place a restriction of any kind upon himself, making the action more difficult to perform or set-up easily. In return the effectiveness of the action, in some way, is greatly boosted."
passive,Lavin,Baroque Works,,1,"As a movement action (that, when used, counts as an action for the purposes of things that proc on actions being used), Lavin can manifest a canvas pad along with his ink brushes and begin working on a new piece of art. This work uses something Lavin can currently see as the subject matter, and Lavin’s roll dictates the quality of the work. Utilizing this Passive requires Lavin to have traditional inks and paints on his person, which become empowered by his Epithet. Once he has completed a work, he can, as an anytime action, invoke the work as a “Baroque Flair”. Doing so causes his body to be enveloped in a pinkish-rainbow light pattern, as he either causes an effect based on the work’s subject to occur or modifies an action he or a unit within 4 spaces of him is performing in relation to said subject. Each time a Baroque Flair is invoked, some of the ink/paint of the utilized work fades away, as do minor amounts of the correlating ink/paint on Lavin’s person. This means that Baroque Flairs have limited uses until Lavin would have to redo a work, which is dictated by how much ink/paint the work has. The more a work has, the more times it can be used, but of course, works of greater complexity may take Lavin longer to paint fully. If Lavin has another painting he has created on his person, he can use this for the purposes of invoking Baroque Flairs."
ability,Lavin,Special Agent Bomber,X,2,"With a snap, Lavin produces a suited figure oozing with Epithetical energy. These “Special Agents” are INCREDIBLY explosive, able to be detonated with horrifying force. Lavin is able to create as many of these Special Agents as he wants at a time, with each one adding 1 to this ability’s cost. However, if these Special Agents are created on a whim, their capabilities are only minorly effective. At any point, Lavin can choose to store the creation of Special Agent Bombers within himself as a bonus action. The longer they stay stored, the more powerful they are when released as a main action. For example, Special Agent Bombers created moments before release are decent. However, if Special Agent Bombers are created days or even weeks before release, their destructive potential skyrockets. As Lavin keeps more and more Special Agents stored inside of himself, his body becomes more and more stressed, potentially causing his failures to misfire into explosions able to damage himself. Special Agents must be kept within 100 ft of Lavin, otherwise their power/capabilities are greatly reduced. Special Agents pass through any DR that is not explicitly and exclusively for explosive damage. If only one Special Agent Bomber is summoned in an instance, this ability can be used as a Bonus Action. Special Agent Bombers must initially be summoned within 50 ft of Lavin. On-Call Kamikaze (X!) - With a whistle, Lavin calls in a Special Agent Bomber flying a fighter jet. They can be called anywhere in the battlefield, and they immediately crash into a unit of Lavin’s choice, exploding violently. The power of this move follows the same conditions of the base Special Agent Bomber ability, but is generally weaker overall. Lavin can use any Special Agents stored within himself for this ability. Detonation Delay (1!) - Whenever a Special Agent would explode, Lavin can use this ability to have them delay the explosion for as long as he desires. The longer the delay, the more the explosion’s power is increased. Lavin can choose any point during any turn to have them explode."
ability,Lavin,Color Burst,3,0,"Lavin’s body shines brightly with a distinct, pinkish rainbow light pattern as he dashes forward at incredible speeds. He can move up to his movement speed +2 in any direction (he is able to fly if he so desires), choose to phase through units and objects while doing so, and can perform martial techniques on those he passes. These attacks typically deal damage equal to that of his basic attack or more. Along with these, he is also able to perform energy blasts while in this state, typically reaching up to 3 spaces away from him, dealing 5-6 damage, and inflicting high knockback. In order to use this ability, Lavin MUST invoke a Baroque Flair, and this ability typically expends more of a work’s ink/paint than a standard invoking would. In return, the Baroque Flair can modify this ability just as it would another action. Once per Combat, Color Burst can be used as an anytime action."
ability,Lavin,Negative Field,3,2,"Lavin takes a deep breath, calming himself as he pushes negative energy out of himself. Doing so produces a 7x7/15ft aura around Lavin, where everyone inside but him is subjected to a torrent of bizarre energy. Specifically, movement becomes sluggish (as if they were moving through sludge), thus reducing it and/or giving units roll penalties, units have the chance to be inflicted with random, negative status effects, and shadows of units and objects have the capability of multiplying and manifesting as summons that Lavin can control on his turn. Maintaining this area has an upkeep cost of 3 + X, with X being equal to the amount of rounds the aura has been on the field. By paying an additional 2 stamina activating this can be done as a Bonus Action. Dark Recesses (X!) - Lavin snaps, choosing a unit in the Negative Field (which can be himself) and causing their shadow to spring to life and perform an action within 5 spaces of the castor. Once this occurs, the shadow of the caster disappears until they leave the Negative Field. Once per Round."
ability,Lavin,Metalworks Cast,X,0,"Lavin conjures a ball of liquid metal before morphing it into any shape of his desire. With this ability, he can produce replicas of any structures or weapons he has ever seen in person, along with more generic forms if he so desires. These metalworks must ALWAYS be touching a living organism or Epithet Construct/Summon, or else they begin to rapidly deteriorate and rust. Stamina Cost is dependent on severity of the desired effect. Smithy Works (X) - Lavin produces a hammer, and uses it to begin morphing/terraforming adjacent units/objects/surfaces. This can produce variable effects depending on what Lavin is using this on, and how he chooses to modify things. If being used on a summon, this can be used as a Bonus Action, but if used on another living unit, it typically requires Lavin to pay more stamina than he would otherwise to use this."
ability,Lavin,Afterimage Trick,2!,2,"Lavin crosses his arms, and after a brief moment, it is revealed that the Lavin that was present on the battlefield was just an afterimage. Lavin can produce any number of afterimage clones while doing this, and can use it to either dodge something or fake doing something. Twice per Round. Quick Shot (1!) - Can only be used after successfully using Afterimage Trick. Lavin shifts his momentum dramatically, allowing him to move up to 4 spaces in any direction while performing a martial technique of his choice."
weapon,Velletri,Reaper's Dance,,0,"Utilizing her twin scythes, Velletri elegantly slashes through a chosen target, dealing damage to their very soul. 8 damage 2 range."
weapon,Velletri,Eclipse Waltz,,0,"With a graceful windup, Velletri tosses one of her scythes with a great deal of spin on it. Pierces through targets before warping back to Velletri's hand automatically. 5 damage 5 range. Alternatively: With a snap, a skull shaped explosion erupts underneath a unit of Velletri's choice. This has a high chance to knock the target prone, and inflicts them with a Cursed Status that deals 1 damage at the start each turn until they can stave the status off with a check. The effect of this can stack. Bonus Action."
talent,Velletri,Death At Every Corner,,0,"Velletri is able to fly naturally, and can teleport to any space she has stepped on as a movement action."
passive,Velletri,Guide of The Underworld,,2,"On one of Velletri's turns, she can create a shroud of epithet based shadow with eyes present on every inch of it. She places this shroud over her head, and cannot move for the rest of the round. However, once the top of the round once again comes, it is revealed that the entire past round was merely her vision of the future, and she then gets three turns to try and change fate. This can only be activated Once per Combat."
passive,Velletri,Back And Call,,1,"Due to her Epithet, and how she has decided to hone it, the being known as Ose is bound to Velletri's soul. She can use her Movement Action to teleport Ose adjacent to her, and can have Ose take stamina costs for her. Ose’s turn can either be separate on Turn Order, or combined with Velletri’s."
ability,Velletri,Spiritual Assistance,1,0,"Producing a ghostly hand constructed of cold flames, Velletri envelops up to two targets of her choice, and drags them to a specific place in the arena. Anyone in the path of one of these dragged units takes 3 damage as they pass by, as does the grabbed unit at the same time."
ability,Velletri,Death Cometh,1,0,"Velletri produces a spectral skull on a space of her choice within 4 spaces of her. This can be done as a once per turn free action. Then, as a standard action, she can activate this ability to immediately dash between every skull on the field, dealing 7 damage to enemies she passes through."
ability,Velletri,Fate Ends Here,1,0,"Velletri extends her hand upward, igniting every space she has stepped on in during this combat in cursed flame. This deals 8-10 damage to anyone standing on the space, and inflicts them with the Cursed Status. Using this ability removes traces of her having stepped on those spaces."
ability,Velletri,Wither Away,2,0,"With a snap, a spectral scythe appears behind a unit of Velletri's choice. The scythe follows them, dealing 1 extra damage to them every time they take damage and increases all stamina costs by 1. This effect lasts until the unit can make a high enough check to stave it off."
ability,Velletri,Reaper's Right Hand Men,2,1,"Velletri creates a skeletal servant that stays on a space within 4 spaces of her current position. If any enemies walk through its adjacent area (including moving out of the area), it can make an attempt to attack them for 5 damage. These servants cannot be damaged, and if any effect attempts to dispel them, Velletri may try to counter roll."
ability,Velletri,Land of The Dead,3,0,"Velletri produces a 7x7 area centered on herself emulating the harshest conditions of The Underworld. Upon activation of this ability, all enemies take 4 damage. Every time an enemy starts their turn in the area, they take 1 + X (X = the amount of consecutive turns one has remained inside) damage and have -X movement. Only one of these areas can be on the field at a time."
ability,Velletri,Fatal Path,10,2,"Velletri selects a 2xInfinite line in the arena, and after an epithet surge, a skeletal reaper appears at the end of the line. At the start of Velletri's turn next round, the reaper flies down the line, swinging its scythe rapidly. Any enemy hit by this attack is reduced to within 5 stamina from death."
weapon,Ose,Ravaging Wrath,,0,"Ose tears into an enemy within 2 spaces of him, typically breaking their bodies in the process. If attacking a prone enemy, this deals +2 damage minimum."
talent,Ose,Eternal Slumber,,1,Ose can sacrifice a turn to heal himself by a fair margin.
passive,Ose,Death Never Dies,,2,"Given strength through Velletri's Epithet, Ose is a revenant bound to her, and is unable to be kept down so long as she is still standing. If Ose is reduced to 0 or lower stamina, he will regain 3 stamina at the start of each of his turns until he gets back up."
ability,Ose,Bull Rush,3,0,"Ose bucks, and then charges forward. He continues moving until he hits a wall, and he drags the first person he hits with him. Anyone else that collides with him after the first takes 6 damage and are knocked to the side, whereas the one Ose charged into takes variable damage depending on how long the charge went on for."
ability,Ose,Skeletal Assault,1!,1,"With a roar, Ose extends an arm towards a target of his choice, so long as they are within 6 spaces of him. His arm then morphs into a completely skeletal form, dealing 4 cold damage to those it collides with. For every time this has been used on a given target, that target takes an extra +2 damage. Once per Round."
ability,Ose,Scream of The Damned,2,2,"Ose lets out a horrifying scream, dealing 5 unblockable, irreducible damage to any enemies within a 5x5 radius of him. This also pushes hit units back 3-4 spaces backwards."

weapon,Ms Tiger,Tail Strike,,0,"Ms. Tiger's tail heats up immensely as it zooms into a unit, dealing 3 fire damage at 2 range as a Bonus Action."
talent,Ms Tiger,Feline Grace,,0,"When Ms. Tiger is free falling, she almost always lands on her feet, and takes little to no fall damage. This also means it is exceptionally hard to knock her prone."
talent,Ms Tiger,Cheetah's Dash,,0,Ms. Tiger gains +2 movement.
passive,Ms Tiger,The Hunter Don't Stop,,1,"When a hunter's on a roll, like hell they're gonna let it end! Whenever Ms. Tiger deals damage, half of that damage (rounded down) is added onto her next attack's damage. If an attack fails, the modifier is used up."
passive,Ms Tiger,Predator Advantage,,0,"The tiger has pounced and made her mark, and now that you're down, you're out. Whenever Ms. Tiger knocks someone prone, she gains +1 damage for the rest of combat."
ability,Ms Tiger,Eye of The Tiger,2!,1,"As something goes to strike Ms. Tiger, her instincts flare up as she begins to perceive things in slow motion. Her eyes dilate as a patch of Epithetical grass pops up next to her. She zooms into it, before teleporting to the source of the attack, honing in on an open spot in their defense. She then performs a basic attack on them, but with up to 6 knockback. If used in a situation other than in reaction to an attack, this attack is not affected by Ms. Tiger's The Hunt Doesn't Stop Passive in any way. Once per Round."
ability,Ms Tiger,Bengal Blitz,3,2,"The rainbow aura usually surrounding Ms. Tiger turns to a stark white as she bursts forward at incredible speeds. She can move in a straight line up to her movement +2, dealing 10-12 fire damage to hit units, and afflicting them with a d4 burn status. Ms. Tiger can convert any damage from this attack into either knockback or into the dice size the burn rolls with (although, for the latter, it's a 2-1 ratio)."
ability,Ms Tiger,Tiger Shot,X,1,"Ms. Tiger's eyes flash rainbow colors as she calls up to 3 spectral tigers out from a location of her choice. They burst out with a fair bit of momentum, and explode into Epithet energy upon damaging a target. Damage and Stamina Cost is dependent on the severity of the desired effect. If the tiger(s) deal no damage to anyone, this ability can be used as a Swift Action."
ability,Ms Tiger,Mouth to Feed,1!,1,"With a snap, Ms. Tiger creates a pair of feline teeth that float in a space within 4 of her current location. If an enemy passes next to the mouth, it bites down on them, dealing 4 damage and holding them in place. If a unit starts their turn stuck in the jaws, they take 1 damage. Once per Round."
ability,Ms Tiger,Cat Scratch Fever,3,0,"Ms. Tiger's claws extend while glowing, producing a sharp sound that rings through the arena. She then scratches a 3 space wide sweeping area, dealing 9-11 to damage to everyone inside. The area that was scratched remains scratched for 1d2 rounds, and it counts as difficult terrain that deals 2 damage to enemies that move onto or off of a space of it."
ability,Ms Tiger,Tiger Destruction,5⛯,2,"Her eyes gleaming, Ms. Tiger performs a knee strike onto an opponent to launch them into the air. The air around her begins to heat up, as she then lunges up with a powerful uppercut, producing a massive spectral tiger that encases her while doing so. This deals 20 damage initially, afflicts a d4 burn status, and makes it so the hit unit takes +1 damage from Ms. Tiger for the rest of combat. When the unit crashes back down to the ground, they produce a 5x5 explosion that deals 7-10 to all enemies inside. Once per Combat."
weapon,Wolf,Brass Knuckle Brawl,,0,"Wolf lets loose a wild flurry of blows with his brass knuckles, showing rather ruthless proficiency in martial arts. 7 damage 1 range."
talent,Wolf,Moody,,0,"Wolf is rather unapologetically angsty, and pretty much nothing shakes him off of that. As such, while he is exceptionally vulnerable to being angered, he is immune to all other emotional effects."
talent,Wolf,Arch Enemy,,1,"Wolf's being adjusts itself to be diametrically opposed to those he has made enemies with. Thus, as he fights someone more and more, he can create modified versions of kit aspects to oppose and counter them."
ability,Wolf,Fated Clash,1!,1,"After taunting an enemy, Wolf dashes in to meet an attack of theirs. This causes him to take the attack full force, amplifying its effect(s) slightly, but then allowing him to perform an especially empowered action against the target. This counterattack is especially difficult to block, dodge, interrupt, etc. Twice per Round."
ability,Wolf,You're Mistaken,1!,2,"In an instant, Wolf dissolves into red energy and teleports behind a target of his choice, having hit them with his basic attack in the process. Each time he does this on a specific target, they gain a stack of Vengeance, which causes them to take +1 damage from Wolf's attacks. If used in tandem with Fated Clash, Wolf can still perform the action that FC grants. Once per Round."
ability,Wolf,Long Way To The Top,3,1,"With a nasty scowl on his face, Wolf jumps back into the air, staring down at a 3x3 area of his choosing. In a flash, a massive red arm punches down onto that area, dealing 10-12 damage and knocking all hit units prone. This fist continues punching that area on Wolf's turn for the next 2 rounds."
ability,Wolf,Relentless Rush,3,1,"Wolf rushes at a target before delivering an absolute beat down upon them. At the same time a series of red arms appear from behind Wolf, punching alongside him. This deals 8-9 damage initially, and Wolf can pay an additional 2 stamina to begin walking forward for half of his movement. If he does this, units take 6-7 damage each time they are hit."
ability,Wolf,Remember Me?,X,0,"Using his Epithet, Wolf reaches into someone’s being and finds something that they either despise or that they are constantly forced to face against. He takes this thing, and applies a buff onto himself or an adjacent target related to said thing."
weapon,Donovan,ATLAS,,0,"Donovan’s sword. As unbreakable as he is. 1 range and 6 damage. Really, literally cannot be broken. Like. Ever."
weapon,Donovan,ACHILLES,,0,"Whaddya mean it's not a sword, look it's got an edge, that means it's a sword. Whaddya mean I just sharpened a metal bat. Every hit against a target reduces their endurance, causing them to take 1 extra damage from physical attacks for the rest of the combat; if the target has any kind of DR, that starts going first, regardless of type. 1 Range 4 damage."
weapon,Donovan,HADES,,0,"The cursed sword, HADES. Donovan found this sword behind a strange wall with weird markings on it while he was punching rocks. The cursed sword HADES can not be removed from his person, ever. It deals 8 damage at 1 range. Every combat he doesn’t use it at least once increases its damage by 4 and crit range by 2 but this also lowers his knockout range by 25% rounded up. It also only receives half of his usual damage bonuses rounded down."
weapon,Donovan,Hand-To-Hand Deathbat,,0,"Donovan is an experienced martial artist and is able to hit things really hard from a surprising distance. 2 range and 4 damage. He cannot be harmed by the backlash of attacking something hard or fire and the like. He gains proficiency if getting a nat20 with this weapon. Wrapping of the Black Dragon - Wrappings that have been exposed to the Black Dragon's curse, when using Hand To Hand Deathbat Donovan can choose to apply the flame curse to the target of the attack. It is a weaker version of it that starts it's damage at 1 then 2 then 3 etc. This also applies to Donovan and since it is specifically coming from the wrappings he only gets a +1 to resist it."
talent,Donovan,I'm The Monster Now,,2,"While at 1 stamina Donovan must take more than 10 damage in a round to be knocked out and he is extremely resistant to status effects that deal damage. He can only gain a maximum of 2 max stamina from combat rewards, achievements and the like. 19. Death Percent? What The Hell’s That Mean? - For every 7 max stamina Donovon has, his knockout requirement goes up by 1. 58. My Epithet... is ENDURE! - Donovon becomes immune to standard status effects that deal damage. Tajvahl Wish - Donovan can now gain a maximum of 4 stamina from rewards."
talent,Donovan,BUFF!+,,0,"Donovan has enhanced his strength by lifting weights on a stick. Donovan is just really fucking strong dude he can lift things up to the weight of a road roller without rolling. In addition, he no longer incurs a movement penalty for doing so and rolls with advantage when throwing objects under that weight limit."
talent,Donovan,Endearing Guy? I Thought They Said Enduring Guy,,1,"Donovan Bushida is just a chill guy tbh. People like to hang out with him and he’s pretty inspiring a lot of the time. Once per round, if an ally besides him fails a roll they can look to him for some advice, if he gives the advice they get a reroll with a bonus depending on the advice given. If they are adjacent to him he can give them a pat on the back and give them advantage on it as well."
passive,Donovan,Unconquerable Will,,1,"Donovan stands tall. He cannot be brought down to 0 stamina or below through stamina costs and will remain at one stamina. While at 1 stamina his damage from his basic attacks is increased by 4 and enemies must deal more than 2 damage to knock him out. Heh, as if you could kill me! - When Donovon is knocked out to -3 or more he is instead brought to -3 and must take 5 or more damage over a round to take more damage, any extra damage he takes past this range while knocked out is set to 3 if it is over 3. I Am Stronger - Donovan’s passive/talent now activates whenever he is at 5 or less stamina (minimum 1), but this does not increase the damage threshold needed to knock him out."
passive,Donovan,ハードダメージパンチングフィスト,,2,"A spark is charged in his head and Donovan remembers his secret martial arts techniques, The Hard Damage Punching Fist and remembers he can punch really hard. Whenever Donovan deals damage with any of his fist techniques he can choose to convert any modifiers he has on him (positive or negative) into damage OR knockback with a 1:1 conversion, this does alter any roll he made with these modifiers in place. In addition he may also convert any damage he deals aside from this into knockback with a 1:1.5 conversion (meaning that if he converts 2 damage he will instead get 3 knockback) but this can only be done with damage he deals naturally and not with bonus damage he might get from converting modifiers."
passive,Donovan,Forcing The Door Open,,2,"Through his will, his training and his fighting spirit Donovan has managed to take a peek into not only his own potential, but also that of one of his swords, ATLAS. ATLAS can now generate Gravity. ATLAS: Weight Training - As a bonus action on his turn Donovan can spend 1-10 stamina to increase the weight of himself and his sword for the round, this stamina cost does go into his knockout range and will deactivate at the start of his next turn unless he pays the upkeep which is equal to half of what he initially spent on it. If he does pay the upkeep, Donovan may not increase the gravity of the sword to stack the gravity buffs. For every 2 stamina he spends, Donovan gains 1 damage on everything he does that deals damage but he also reduces his own movement by 1, in addition he becomes harder and harder to move the more stamina he pumps into this. His attacks with ATLAS specifically are now harder to counter, giving enemies a -1 to countering him for every 3 stamina put into this and disadvantage at 10 stamina. ATLAS: Weight of the World - Donovan can also pay an extra 3 stamina to increase the gravity of those that he cut, weighing them down for the round, removing their ability to double move, removing flight capabilities, lowering their movement by half rounded down and giving them a heavy minus to taking actions that use their legs or wings if they have any. But he may not increase the gravity of himself and generate gravity on any of his sword slashes in the same round."
ability,Donovan,I Have Three Swords,X,2,"Yup, he sure does. And he uses it to slash a single target within his movement range for his sword’s damage.This ability has a different effect depending on which sword he is using and upgrades when he obtains a new sword from his proficiency upgrades. ATLAS: WORLDBREAKER (3) - When using ATLAS to attack a target, Donovan performs one mighty slash splitting the earth behind his target up to 4 spaces away in a line, anyone caught in this takes half of his weapon damage and creating difficult terrain. ACHILLES: HEEL (X) - Using the back side of the blade Donovan repeatedly smacks it into his own face, every smack increasing his power and giving him a +1 to his rolls for the next round each time. The cost of the ability is how many times he smacks himself in the face as he deals 1 damage each time, this counts towards his round knockout range. This is a bonus action on his turn. HADES: UNDERWORLD (5) - Donovan doesn’t know how to fully control this sword’s power just yet, but he does know how to hit things really hard to try and draw it out. Donovan takes a simple two-handed sword stance and swings the sword as hard as he can, when he does a black flame in the form of a dragon arises and scorches a 3x7 area in front of him, everyone in that area takes the weapon’s current damage and are left with a black flame status that starts trying to corrode the body dealing 3 damage at the start of their next turn, then 4, then 5 and so on, starting from the hands it will slowly creep up the body until it consumes them whole and drags their bodies into HADES. This non-standard status effect even affects Donovan himself, and while everyone gets a check to try and endure the black flame on each of their turns, Donovan rolls with a +3. Donovan must take the stamina cost for this ability even if it means going into his knockout range and it stays in his knockout range for 2 rounds. This does count as using this sword if it succeeds. Once per combat."
ability,Donovan,Streaming Leaf Art,2!,2,"After making a basic attack with “Hand-to Hand Deathbat” whether it succeeded or failed he may use this ability to attack again with “Deathbat” but with a +2 to hit, if he failed the previous attack he does this with a +5. Once per round.  Go Crazy. Go Deathbat - Streaming Leaf Art may now be used twice per round, however, only if he successfully rolls above a 10 naturally with the first use of it in a round, in addition it does not gain the modifiers and the stamina cost is deducted from his passive round damage if applicable."
ability,Donovan,Just Stick Your Sword In It,2,0,"Actually do just that. Now it’s stuck on your sword, swing it around or some shit. Increased something depending on what you “pick up.” I’d suggest doing this with ATLAS and not any other sword."
ability,Donovan,Taifū Ha No Fumetsu Ken,5⛯,1,Donovan channels his energy into his ultimate technique that he hastily tried to translate into Japanese. Moving behind his target at speeds unrecognizable he kicks them into the air and then throws his sword at them before moving behind the target again and punching them down through the sword leaving the sword perfectly upright with the blade up and through the target. This deals his “Deathbat” damage on the first hit and “ATLAS’s” damage two times after that. He then retrieves the blade. He must roll 3 times for this to work but only the first attack can be countered the rest cannot be responded to by enemies. He loses the damage prevention of his passive for 1-2 rounds after using this. Once per combat.
ability,Donovan,It's Nothing,0!,2,"Once per combat Donovan can redirect the damage from an attack onto himself from his allies. This includes all damage from AoE’s and multi hit moves. He is reduced to a minimum of 1 stamina even if the damage was more but the part of his passive that keeps him from spending stamina is canceled and he can now be knocked out as normal, but his basic attack damage is now additionally increased by the damage he took to a maximum of 10 additional damage and his movement is also doubled. He can now move, act and move again. Listen, I am strong! - It’s Nothing! No longer negates the stamina spending part of his passive, and he can use it on himself."
ability,Donovan,Let Me Show You How To Take A Hit,2!,1,"Whenever Donovan or an adjacent ally would be hit by an attack he can choose to endure the whole attack, taking half of the total damage rounding up. If he pays 1 stamina (which will go into his knockout range if it needs too) he can then make a follow-up basic attack if they are within his movement and range, but since he is showing them how to take the attack it only deals half the damage rounding up. Once per round."
ability,Donovan,Trestoryu Sword Technique,3 + (3? + X? + 5?),1,"I have these swords. I might as well use them. With ATLAS in his right hand, ACHILLES in his left and HADES in his mouth the air around Donovan shifts, heats up and warps as he stares dead in the eyes of everyone in front of him.Taking a stance of power he rushes forward up to thrice his movement attacking every enemy in his path while expertly maneuvering around his allies. This technique is equal to 5 spaces wide and when attacking an enemy he chooses two of his three swords to do so with applying any and all effects (Including WORLDBREAKER, HEEL and UNDERWORLD) they have on to the targets and he may not use the same pair of swords every time he does so. With ACHILLES: HEEL specifically, using it on an enemy instead of dealing damage gives them a roll minus for each stamina spent on it. After the attack has commenced the damage prevention of his passive is deactivated for the rest of combat and he may not use his sword’s unique abilities for the rest of the combat either. If he chooses to just attack a single unit and no one else not only can he use all three of his swords but the base damage/effects of this attack are tripled but Donovan is completely KO’d and cannot be revived in the same combat via his own techniques or others as his entire body convulses in pain only barely enduring the feedback. The cost for this is equal to the amount of times he uses these techniques on top of the base costs and if he would go to 0 or below he may only spend cost up to his maximum knockout range (not including base cost), the roll for the base ability is made with advantage and all subsequent attacks must also be rolled for but are done so without advantage. If this ability fails he only takes base cost. Recharge 8-9 on a d9."
weapon,Ensosu,PSP (Portable Sword Powers),,0,"Her epithet manifestation can create a hardlight sword when held in the right position and extend and rearrange as needed. 6 Damage 3 range. 43 DOOM Clone - Instead of her holo-sword Ensōsu may focus and shift it into the form of a gun to fire hardlight data from, with 8 range 3 damage instead. This form deals double damage to demonic/hell-based creatures."
talent,Ensosu,Extended Battery Life,,0,"Being as her epithet’s manifestation is as a portable video game handheld Ensōsu’s epithet generates electricity on top of everything else it does, because of this she’s never without a source of power if need be. In addition she can give any of her actions electrical damage/properties if she wishes."
ability,Ensosu,Kaizo Block,2!,2,"Ensōsu taps a few buttons before her epithet manifests a question mark block in front of or above something of her choice within 4 spaces. If the block is hit because of this, whatever action hits it is either decently reduced in effectiveness or forced to be aimed in a different direction, the target’s choice. If the block is hit outside of this it instead manifests 1d20 gold coins (1 gold coin is equivalent to 5 dollars of actual money) before being broken. Once per round. 50 But What Will You Do About The Second One? - When Ensōsu would use Kaizo Block, she may set down two instead, or only set down one as per normal. If she does so, it is instead a one cost, and she has a second instance she can use this round of another 1 placement one cost."
ability,Ensosu,Holo-Graphics,X,0,"Ensōsu manifests a hardlight construct of an item of her choice or a clone of herself. In the case of the former this ability is a bonus action with cost determined by the GM, size cannot exceed a large tile. In the case of the latter this is a 4 cost main action, the clone has 8 stamina and access to all of your powers and has the same ROM slots as you did when you made them. This clone cannot get new ROMs and all limited types of economy (like the ROM slot exchange bonus action) are shared between all instances of yourself. You do not have a clone limit but only the original may create clones."
ability,Ensosu,Subspace Emissary,5,1,"Ensōsu focuses and transports a 3x3 area of her choice to be transported into her epithet, this takes in all “targets” and objects within the area. This explicitly cannot be used on herself, and targets inside can make a dc 10 resist check as a move action on their turn to force their way out. She may remove all current targets from this subplane as a free action on her turn, in which case they are deposited in spaces adjacent to her. While inside she can apply effects to targets inside based off of a video game of her choice as a move action for 3 stamina, this effect applies to anyone currently stored inside evenly without bias. Those inside may attempt to freely target her with their actions as though they were adjacent to her. If Ensōsu goes unconscious while people are inside her Subspace they are all forcibly ejected and take 8 damage."
weapon,Hoshu,Guildmaster's Post Tube,,0,"A thin narrow tube which must remain zipped at all times last you have to spend half a forsaken hour recollecting all the papers stored in there. This holds far more paper than it should due to some slight epithet augmentation. 5 damage, 1 range. "
weapon,Hoshu,Guild Manager's Cup,,0,"Because I'm tired as all get-out and my work is never complete. Hoshu has a coffee mug blessed by an enchantment that a fresh brew will refill whenever it would be emptied, which is often. Does 3 damage melee and a 1d2 burn status."
talent,Hoshu,Just Don't Talk To Me. Ever.,,0,"If you critically succeed in an attack on someone using your coffee you can choose to completely deafen yourself to anything they would say, in the case of sonic effects they create you are now immune to them. In addition you get +1 Guild Point."
talent,Hoshu,Of Accords And Empires,,0,Hoshu is a very informed and well looked to person in his home land for many reasons. And... While Hoshu may not explicitly want to wish themselves into the position of a leader they are nonetheless heading there thanks to their Epithet and natural genius. Whenever Hoshu rolls for a perception or knowledge-based roll to deduce properties of which could be useful for a stereotypical adventuring party or the adventure at hand he gains advantage on the roll. As part of such he may freely transfer the information to all Guild Members within the vicinity to grant them a bonus to circumventing the problem or making use of the information. This could be something such as bypassing dragon’s tough scales to penetrate damage reduction or making use of a monstrous beast’s keen sight to blind them for an extended period of time.
weapon,Aeron,Axe Kick,,0,"As someone who runs around a lot you’ve worked up quite a bit of kicking strength. One range 4 damage, 2 knockback. 25: +1 weapon damage. 40: +1 weapon damage. [TRADE] +2 weapon damage"
talent,Aeron,Gotta Jet,,0,Aeron is no stranger to going through the back alleys and running from people he pissed off because he couldn't kick the shit out of all of them. Once per move action you can try to kick off the ground to get an extra space of movement and if you fail your current move action is one lower.
talent,Aeron,Lucky Lottery Card,,0,"Upon obtaining this talent, choose a lucky number [6]. You now critically succeed when rolling that number! If you would already crit on that number, then it acts as a double crit that is even more effective. If you would critically fail on that number, it is considered a normal success instead."
passive,Aeron,Apple of My Eye,,2,"Your epithet is one you have carefully cultivated in a way that you can do things entirely unrelated to plant-based abilities. At the start of the session you get 1d3 Fruits of the Devil which may be eaten as a move action to grant its user a kit of great power and potential until the end of combat. If a character attempts to eat a second fruit before the first has passed through their system they take 50 irresistible damage which can kill them and lose their next turn. 23: +1 to the Devil Fruits rolled at the start of a session. 31: Eating a devil fruit now heals for 5 stamina. 33: The Devil’s Power Grows - Each of your Devil Fruits gain a new upgrade! 54: The Devil’s Power Grows +1 - Each of your Devil Fruits gain a new upgrade! 59: Your 1d3+1 for Devil Fruits at the start of a session is now exploding. 73: Deal with the Devil - You may eat more than one Fruit of the Devil without suffering the relevant consequences, but if you do so you gain no combat rewards at the end of combat."
passive,Aeron,Harvest Season,,1,"Whenever Aeron critically succeeds on an attack he must choose one: immediately gain another Devil Fruit; OR use Cross Pollination immediately on one of the targets regardless of if they’re willing or not so long as they still act as a valid target for the other conditions, independently of your once per combat usage."

ability,Aeron,Fruit Parfait,3⛯,0,"Create a mixture of fruit that can be consumed by you or an ally to gain the effects of a devil fruit for one round, this does not count against your total usable fruit limit for the session. Once per combat."
ability,Aeron,Cross Pollination,X,0,"If a target (that is either non-human or has an epithet) is willing you may take a sample of their blood and permanently create a new breed of Fruit of the Devil based on their powers. It starts as just one ability and passive just like all of your devil fruits do, these do not necessarily have to be the same way its creator uses that powerset. They are only added to your list after the session ends. Cost is determined by the GM and the specific power that would be added to your list. STOLEN: [Once per combat.] 38: Plants Unlike Any Seen On Earth - You may now use Cross Pollination on targets without blood or even non-living targets by breaking a small and unimportant piece off instead of taking a blood sample. The target must still be willing (non-sentient items are considered automatically willing), the break cannot cause any actual effects to the thing mechanically, and the break cannot occur on indestructible or non-solid things. "
ability,Aeron,Seed of Vengeance,1!,0,"When you would take damage or a negative status effect you may channel some of the pain you received into a small receptacle seed, this receptacle may be then planted into a target’s body as a free action to gain a plus equal to half the damage you took to the next action against the originator of that effect. If the effects did not deal damage you may instead cause your retaliation action to inflict a minor form of the same debuff to the target. 18: If you currently have a devil fruit you may alter the Seeds of Vengeance you put into others with traits of that devil fruit, for example making the seed give some kind of effect while implanted or causing an additional effect in addition to the boost. Once per round"
ability,Aeron,Bullet Seed,1,0,"Have you ever heard that myth about if you eat a watermelon without spitting out the seeds you’ll have one growing in your stomach? Yeah that’s pretty stupid to be fair, but it does act as a great source of ammo. Spit out a rapidfire amount of seeds targeting up to 2 targets 4 spaces away for 3 damage each. If you have a devil fruit you can add additional debuffs/range/damage or other effects as long as it makes sense to the attack. 47: Choose one: +1 Bullet Seeds [Liliana’s Essence Boost] The more Bullet Seed is used per combat the stronger it will be with the following guide being how it works; The first upgrade is garnered the first time it is successfully used; Bullet Seed’s range increases by 2. The Second Upgrade is obtained when you successfully add a devil fruit effect to Bullet Seed; the speed at which the seeds are shot is increased, inflicting a -3 to rolls in reaction to it. The Third Upgrade Bullet Seed can be gotten by dealing at least 10 damage with it in a single use; Bullet Seed is now an anytime action that can (but doesn’t have to) be used to try and deflect things instead of dealing damage. The Fourth Boost is triggered when you successfully take no damage through using Bullet Seed to defend yourself; If you spend a total of 3 stamina when using it you may treat the bullet seeds as an instance of Invasive Species. The last boost that Bullet Seed which can only be garnered with a natural 20 on using it is the following: Bullet Seed can be used to grow a Devil Fruit inside a target for each set of seeds shot into them."

I then can pay max stamina equal to a quarter of the original stamina spent (rounding up) in order to have this be a permanent change to my ability or basic attack. How do I do this?

I need to be careful however because once I use an epithet as inspiration for an ability I am unable to use the same epithet again if I were to swap out one epithet for another. The ability itself cannot directly take kit aspects from the epithets in question, however it can be very close. I don't want to get in copyright trouble. The ability in terms of power level is proportional to my current prof and is created by the whims of my magic! (Either Rob or Ballast or the GM of the session. Whoever wants to make it really.) (The ability created by this passive cannot trigger I’m Just Built Different, Sorry.)"
ability,Gwydion,Come Up With Concoction,1,0,"Add a little of this, and a little of that, and what do you get? Presto, a magic potion! The downside? It’s extremely volatile and will explode almost immediately. Oh well, that’s not the important part. You can chuck it up to you’d estimate 6 range, and it’ll explode in, say, a 3x3 area, dealing 2 damage to everyone in it and applying the effect you intended of the potion to everyone in that area. Isn’t magic science fun?"
ability,Gwydion,Squiggle-Me-This,2,0,"Draw some random magic circle on the floor, add a little pizazz to it, and see what happens! Or, in layman's mechanical terms, draw some random symbol on the floor, and the GM has to parse some effect from it! If the GM doesn’t think of an effect from it within 10 seconds then I, GWYDION DAWNHEART, can declare what it actually is (when in reality a random party member gets to decide what it is)."
ability,Gwydion,Expecto Patronixum ,4,1,"As it turns out, all language is magic in a way. So I’ll just take whatever piece of writing or a quote someone just said, and turn it into a magic chant that causes effects. These words cannot be said with the intention of being used by this, they have to be chosen by complete accident. 52. I can use Expecto Patronixum as a bonus action if I use one word… 53. If I use one word when I use Expecto Patronixum as an action its effectiveness is greatly enhanced. Built Different: +2 to rolls"
ability,Gwydion,Oh Heavens Forbid Excuse Me,0!,1,"Blow your pipe smoke into an enemy’s eyes that are within 3 spaces of you, canceling an anytime action they were going to use. Once per round"
ability,Gwydion,Reverse Engineering,1,0,"Analyze something, deconstruct it, and reconstruct it. From now on you can permanently build that object if you have the necessary components around. You can even make due with some substitute parts."
weapon,Joe,Jack,,0,"6 damage 1 range. An extremely durable and threatening red scythe Joe can summon at will. It’s full name is Jack of Diamonds, but Joe just calls it Jack since he’s too lazy to say the full thing. Summoning Jack of Diamonds is a non-rolled (unless in the possession of an enemy, in which it’s a contested roll) bonus action, and it will instantly teleport from its previous location to Joe’s hands. 48: Sleeker Cards / Sleeker Scythe - +1 to damage to Joe’s Jack of Diamonds (and thus blades of jack) or Cards"
weapon,Joe,Card,,0,"A playing card formed from Joe’s epithet, he’s become incredibly good at throwing them, though they don’t deal any damage… yet. 0 damage 6 range, can be thrown as a bonus action (this requires a roll). Cards can stick to pretty much any surface, or even hang in the air thanks to epithet shenanigans, and aren’t affected by their paper counterparts' usual weaknesses (such as fire and water). They can be torn and cut, however. 41: Cutting (with) the Deck - Joe has mastered his throwing technique, and his epithet cards are harder than ever. They may now deal 2 damage, and if embedded into something they can stick it in place, if Joe wishes. 16: Card Counting - For every 2 cards Joe has out on the field, he rolls with a stacking +1."
weapon,Joe,Blades of Jack,,0,Joe forms scythe blades from any number of his epithet playing cards. These blades deal 5 (-1 per additional card used) damage at 1 range from the cards location. 48: Sleeker Cards / Sleeker Scythe - +1 to damage to Joe’s Jack of Diamonds (and thus blades of jack) or Cards
talent,Joe,No Such Thing as a Bad Hand,,0,"Whenever Joe rolls a nat 1 or someone rolls a nat 20 against him, he may make an additional roll, if this roll is above a 14 you may flavour the repercussions as actually lucky (though you will still take them), and perform a fitting action or ability with a +3 in response. 52: Luckier Man - Joe may now use the effects of No such thing as a bad hand when a nearby (within 5 spaces) enemy crit succeeds on an ally or an ally crit fails. If Joe has a card attached to an ally he doesn’t have to be nearby and using his luck god blood he may channel his luck into them, allowing them the effect instead."
talent,Joe,Hands of Sleight,,0,"As a master manipulator of cards, Joe is as dextrous as they come. He may perform a quick and sneaky action such as swapping something out, pickpocketing, or using an object for minor effect (e.g. pressing a button) as an anytime action, though if used not on his turn it consumes his next turn’s bonus action. Additionally, if Joe resheathes the Shuffle Blade within the first 2 turns he draws it the cooldown is negated."
passive,Joe,House Advantage,,2,"The blood of an ancient god who embodied the spirit of gambling, luck, and greed flows through Joe’s Veins. One of the many ways this power manifests itself is in the form of special cards that stand out from the usual ones Joe throws around -an Ace or four up his sleeve. Joe starts combat and RP with 4 Aces, kept track of in his red stat. He can use them to subtly bend luck, in the form of raising any rolled number up or down by one per Ace used (the resulting number caused by using an Ace is counted as natural for all intents and purposes). Each time a natural 1 or 20 is rolled during combat or RP, an Ace is refreshed (adding 1 red stat). Nats of either type created with Aces do not refresh their uses. 60. Wild Aces - By paying a fitting amount of stamina (decided by the GM, be wary of lowballing), Joe may convert one of his aces into any other type of card, shuffling it into his deck and re-drawing it in a flashy manner. He may then use this card immediately, or hold it to use as an anytime, causing an effect relating to the card formed. This effect must be rolled for, a failure does not consume the card. The card is then expended, and returns to a normal ace."
passive,Joe,Got a Hot Hand!,,1,"Joe, clicking his fingers with a sly face, may force any number of his currently out cards to shatter into pure luck as a rolled anytime action, giving a roll a + or - 2 for each card removed. These results are NOT considered natural. If he explodes 5 cards he may regain an ace instead."
passive,Joe,ざわざわ...,,0,"Whenever you would be put under a negative emotion, either through an actual effect or just naturally get put into that headspace the world around you intensifies. You gain a 3 space radius aura that inflicts that emotional status onto everyone inside it who does not pass a save"
ability,Joe,Shuffle Blade,2!,0,"Joe draws a strange heirloom passed down his family, a sword that changes into any random blade that exists in the world when unsheathed. After 6 turns it changes back into it’s useless base form, and must be sheathed again. Cannot be used for a turn after being sheathed. (Weapon List) 39: Quickdraw - When Joe uses Shuffle Blade, for an extra stamina he may slash with it immediately, with advantage. However, he must state he’s doing this before reading the result."
ability,Joe,Pay-Out,1!,1,"Joe can use his epithet to send things through his cards at will. Send something right near or in Joe’s possession flying in or out of a card up to 4 spaces. Something can be pulled in one card and flung out another in the same action. If a card is adjacent to Joe or in the way of an attack, he may use this to attempt to redirect it. Once per round 19: Delayed Payments - Pay-out can now also store attacks and objects within cards for later. Releasing them requires another roll, but can be done as a 1 cost anytime that does not take up Pay-out’s once per round usage. Cards currently storing something cannot redirect attacks, but *can* be used with Jack of Blades.        "
ability,Joe,Buy-In,2,1,"Borrow an amount of a stat, a weapon/ability/talent/passive, buff, or roll from any consenting party. When the borrowed thing is returned, Joe must give the recipient interest in the form of something of value equal or greater than what was borrowed, this can be stamina, a favor, anything of yours within reason. If someone wants the borrowed thing back and you wish to keep it, you must roll against them, on failure it is returned immediately and the interest must be given then and there. This is repeated on your turn each round until you fail. 26: Dirty Money - Once per round, if Joe wants to use Buy-In but the other party is unwilling, he may force a roll off against them. If he wins the borrowing effect goes off without their say.  If done this way, at least 2 rounds after the current must have passed before they can roll to forcefully reclaim it, unless Joe just gives it back to them."
ability,Joe,Trump Cards,3⛯,0,"It’s Joe’s firm belief that the key to being the best gambler is never entering a bet unless you know you’ll win, and one of the best ways to ensure that is a strong trump card ...or three. Calling on the power of both his bloodline and epithet at once, Joe forms large shimmering cards equal to the amount of people he’s seen so far this session, then shuffles them all together and draws 3. Roll 3d however many characters with a kit he’s seen this session, then choose a single card imbued with an ability from each one (the results are kept secret from all other players, unless you wish to reveal them). These cards are then able to be used once at no cost by anyone holding them, if the roll to use them fails they are not consumed. Once per combat. "
ability,Joe,Shamble Gambler,3,0,"Joe holds out his hands as an amount of glowing cards equal to the number of people in the area appear before him. By shuffling these new cards, Joe may “shuffle” the locations of everyone on the field, replacing any person’s location with another’s once. Additionally, Joe can swap people with cards he has out on the field, and vice versa. Twice per combat."
ability,Joe,Card Sharp,3,,"Placing a hand on his Shuffle Blade, Joe forms a singular glowing rainbow card whose face is constantly shifting. Roll a Shuffle Blade, this card “contains” the essence of that blade. He may also use another blade within touch, if he wishes. While in possession of this card Joe can: use Blades of Jack with the card’s blade instead of Jack (if this blade is particularly powerful it may gain slightly reduced effectiveness), toss the card to an ally as a free action allowing them to form and use it for the card’s duration, or just use it himself -allowing him to have two different Shuffle Blades at a time. Card lasts 4 rounds, and Joe can only have one at a time. This card counts for Card Counting."
ability,Joe,Dealt a Bad Hand,3,,"...Well, there’s no such thing as a bad hand for *me*, at least. Joe draws a single sinister-looking card and chucks it up to his card’s basic attack range (6 range). He may then set it to activate upon an enemy stepping on or near it or activate it straight away. When activated the bad hand card expands into a 4x8 area -while in this area enemies take 1.5 damage and crit fail on rolls of 2 and lower. The bad hand space counts as an epithet card for the purposes of Joe’s kit, but cannot be burnt with Got a Hot Hand!. After activation, it lasts until the end of Joe’s next turn."
ability,Joe,Unroll,1!,,"Disregard the roll that fate had in mind, negating an action if you beat the natural roll. On a success that doesn't beat the natural roll this instead forces a reroll but prevents any roll bonuses, alterations, or other fuckery the target would normally have to this roll. Once per round."
talent,Raihime,The Power of Patience,,,"Rai has the patience and capacity to write in every single possible combination of letters and numbers required for a keycode, this takes a long time. If they wish to speed this up for any reason they have to spend a lot of stamina. In addition, they have an eidetic memory, but only for useless things like codes and how to solve the puzzle in the right way to get her powers out."
talent,Raihime,Spiritual Connection,,,"Raihime is a shrine maiden if that wasn’t obvious enough. But she is very well trained in the spiritual arts, this allows her to not only communicate with spirits and ghosts with ease but also allows her to interact with them as if they were regular material creatures. 23 - Spirit Helpline - As a bonus action on her turn, or in conjunction with another one of her actions, Raihime is capable of calling upon the ambient spirits in the area to perform an action for her in exchange for being peacefully sent to the afterlife afterwards. This costs her 1-3 stamina to do and her player may generally choose what kind of spirit is assisting her. If the spirit was a particularly evil person in their life the effect is most likely boosted (if it’s something to do with their skill set) but the cost is doubled as Raihime needs to send them to hell instead."
ability,Raihime,Clap,1,,"Rai’s shrine maiden training shows that she doesn’t actually *need* her epithet or the powers granted by the puzzle box. Generating spiritual energy in her palms she claps, this generates a soundwave that deals 3-5 damage to all enemies up to 4 spaces around her. This naturally deals double damage to spiritual beings."
ability,Raihime,Divine Sight,2,,"Rai is able to channel her spiritual power into her eyes as a bonus action. This not only allows her to see through invisibility and illusions but once per combat she is able to know the stamina value of all of her enemies in combat. In addition to this she also granted a +2 to rolls, +1 to ability damage and a crit range of 18+. This buff lasts for 1d2 rounds."
ability,Raihime,Burning Compromise,1,,Spirit energy is channelled around Rai as she attacks a unit with her palm. This palm strike deals 3 damage and passes DR. Afterwards that unit will either take 2 damage per each of their own turns or they must pay Rai 1 stamina. 11 - Ability Upgrade - Compromising The Spirit - Those afflicted with Raihimie’s Spirit Burn can also choose to give Raihime +1 Crit range for the rest of combat instead of taking damage or giving Raihime stamina. Her crit range may only be increased to a maximum of +5 however.
weapon,Wayne,Popgun Musket,,,"An old-fashioned popgun that, due to Wayne’s Epithet, causes actually REAL gun damage. No bullets, just the popping of the gun, but still hurts like a gun does. 4 damage with 3 range. 29. Oh, By The Way, I Shot You - Wayne is able to elect for Popgun Musket to not deal any damage initially, allowing him to activate the damage as an anytime later. This may potentially interrupt a hit unit, or at least lessen the effectiveness of their action."
talent,Wayne,Power Nap,,,"Wayne’s Epithet is only more potent while he is asleep, enabling him to always have lucid dreams. This, paired with his simple love of naps, has him heal for 3 stamina every round that he is asleep. 37. Couldn’t Give Less of a Shit - Not only does Wayne’s Epithet make his mind very hard to penetrate, but he also just does not care a lot of the time. As such, he is immune to mental based effects not caused by himself unless he specifically wants to be affected by them."
passive,Wayne,"Wow, The Land of Make Believe!",,,"If there’s one game that Wayne is good at playing, it’s “The Imagination Game”. At the start of combat, he can establish a make-believe scenario that the battle is molded by. For instance, he can declare that the battle is “a battle between heroes and dragons to save a princess”, which causes the members of the combat to gain buffs/modifications depending on what role they are playing. This passive can affect combatants, the setting, or both. People affected by this can choose to “get in character” if they want, but there are no mechanical differences for if one does or does not. 35. Midsummer Daydream - If Wayne does not use his movement action to move and/or he fails an action, he starts to slightly nod off and get distracted by a disparate thought. This thought is a daydream of some kind, typically involving Wayne in some sort of peaceful/relaxing scenario or a couple of characters having some sort of interaction with each other. Each time this is proc’d successively, his daydream becomes more and more vivid, and in doing so, an aura begins to flare up around Wayne. This aura produces an effect based off of the daydream, more so affecting units/the area adjacent to Wayne, but also himself to a minor degree. The aura starts out as barely present, but increases in effectiveness at a decent pace for each proc. As implied, using a movement action to move or succeeding an action causes the effect to falter and be reduced somewhat, with movement scaling harder than action success/failure. If Wayne desires, he can pay variable amounts of stamina to keep the effect around, scaling based on effectiveness."
ability,Wayne,"Nope, Not Acknowledging That",X!,,"We’re just gonna pretend that that shit did not happen. Wayne can take something he can see, whether it be an attack, an object, or something else, and then decides that he’s going to just ignore it. This makes whatever is that he chooses to be unable to affect/interact with Wayne and/or the target of the action. If Wayne chooses to use this on something he can interact with by either means, such as another unit, he is also unable to interact with them so long as this ability is active. Once per round."
ability,Wayne,Thought Bubble,3,,"Wayne thinks up a storm and a literal thought bubble appears in the air, displaying either an object or an area. While it is on the field, he can travel into it and/or throw other things into it, where they can then interact with/be affected by the bubble’s contents. One can only enter a thought bubble if Wayne wants them to, and Wayne is able to travel between the bubbles as portals if he so desires. 33. Lost in Deep Thought - By using Thought Bubble as a Full Turn Action and paying an additional stamina, Wayne can have a Thought Bubble cover a 9x9 area of his choice as its contents leak into the real world. This bubble’s contents are fairly complex in comparison to the base Thought Bubble, typically showcasing a specific scene/location of Wayne’s choice. This can essentially be a mini-world, as elaborate as Wayne likes, allowing him to produce a bevy of effects from it (which may require additional stamina costs). These larger bubbles last until the end of combat, or if there is not a person in them for a full round, and only one of them can be present on the field at a time."
ability,Wayne,Imaginary Friend,3,,"After a brief moment of thinking, Wayne whips up a new soldier-friend to act as a summon. What comprises the makeup of this friend? I dunno. It’s whatever Wayne thinks of, and we all gotta pretend that they’re here and real. Regardless of how goofy or childish some of these guys can be, Wayne is apathetic about them as he is at everything else. Once per combat. 22. Foster’s Home - Once per session, Wayne is able to choose to remember a potentially weakened version of a summon created via Imaginary Friend. Specifically, he commits to registering them in his long term memory, which his Epithet bolsters. From this point forward, Wayne is able to summon any friends saved from Foster’s Home without taking up the Once per Combat usage of Imaginary Friend."
ability,Wayne,Talking In Hypotheticals,3⛯,,"Wayne proposes an idea for a big, tide turning event that could happen, involving as many people within the combat as he so desires. This typically takes the form of a giant, team tech maneuver, but can be whatever sort of thing Wayne wants. By the time he’s done explaining it, he realizes that his Epithet has already taken effect, and whatever he said could happen has already happened. Once per combat."
weapon,Cheshire,Wits and Reflexes,,,"Cheshire prefers not to dirty his hands, but if he must then so be it. Basic punches and kicks without the use of his right hand. 3 damage as a melee weapon. 31. Increase basic attack damage by one or gain knockback one. 52. Increase basic attack damage by one or knockback by one."
talent,Cheshire,Speed-Reader,,,By using a move action you can completely read a book cover to cover.
talent,Cheshire,Checking The Selection,,,"Cheshire has so much information backlogged, there’s a chance he could know about anything anyone could think of. Whenever faced with something seemingly unfamiliar, or if another character has to roll to see if they remember certain pieces of information, Cheshire can roll a check of his own to see if he’s read up on the topic before, even if it seems random or as if he wouldn’t have before."
passive,Cheshire,Personal Library,,2,"During combat, Cheshire is always holding what appears to be an open gloss-hardback catalog in his right hand. This is actually a physical manifestation of his Epithet, and various objects and people are listed inside. Each set of pages describing a specific thing is laid out as if it were a scan of an advertisement in a gaming magazine or comic (Example: https://gematsu.com/2017/11/dragon-ball-fighterz-adds-gotenks-kid-buu-adult-gohan), and the information present is essentially a stylized character sheet that describes a small bit about them and their abilities. All entries in the catalog are listed in alphabetical order, and if Cheshire wants to take advantage of the benefits of one of them, the book must specifically be open on those pages. If the pages describe a non-living object, Cheshire can summon said object as a free action on his turn, and it remains on the field until the pages are changed. If the pages describe a living object, Cheshire has access to their character sheet to use as he pleases until the pages are changed. He can only flip to a new page once per turn, but it is a free action. There are two ways to add new entries into the catalog: by directly knocking out a unit, or by specifically probing, observing, and researching them over time. The more acquainted Cheshire is with the powerset of something before he adds it into the catalog, the more effective he will be at utilizing their pages. Therefore, typically, Cheshire gains more powerful entries through the direct research method, as opposed to the knock-out method. These entries are permanent unless Cheshire specifically gets rid of one for some reason. 38. Your Personal Library book can now float without needing to be held; opening up both your hands. 46. You may now have two pages open within the Personal Library at the same time. 65. Library Loan - Cheshire may allow someone access to one of his pages in the form of a much thinner book that they can carry around. They are subject to Cheshire’s original rule that they must hold the book open in their dominant hand to use it and if it would be removed from their grip it is desummoned and they must use a bonus action to remanifest it. While this is the case Cheshire does not have access to the page. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4xRnTcnghAnM686uKSBuByTgUurK1hPyDv3xA5aJYc/edit?usp=sharing "
passive,Cheshire,Brain Rescrambler,,0,"The user is immune to memory alteration of any kind while they have this fruit, as they can actively undo any changes as they’re being made with but a thought."
passive,Cheshire,Falsified Fervour,,,"As a 1 cost unrolled anytime action, Cheshire can don a mask featuring a specific emotion. While he is maintaining this persona, his real emotions are completely obscured with those depicted on the mask. Masks donned this way can also be given simple “impressions”, such as trustworthiness, or bloodlust. He must pay 1 upkeep at the start of his turns to maintain this mask, and changing the depiction while it is activated is a free swift action on his turn."
passive,Baku Baku no Mi,Iron Stomach,,,"You can eat just about anything without adverse effects, and you can eat seemingly an endless amount. Eaten things are stored in your stomach for easy retrieval at any point. Eating things can restore health based on the size of the item, and you can eat small things (ie can fit in your hand) as a bonus action. You can eat people, but only if they’re willing, or you are both more than double their size and succeed in a contested check."
ability,Cheshire,Taking a Page From Your Book,2,1,"After a sharp glare, Cheshire reaches over to an adjacent target, grabs them, and “tears out a page from within them”. This page has a portion of their character sheet, whether that be part of or a full description of something, written on it, and taking it away from its owner makes it so they no longer have access to that section unless they retrieve the page from Cheshire. This can also be done to attributes not specifically mentioned on the character sheet so long as Cheshire has heard them mention it verbally before. With the page in hand, he can place it on someone or something (including himself), and they will gain the attribute written on the paper. If the paper does not feature a full sentence, Cheshire can interpret what the effect shall be based on what is written."
ability,Cheshire,Bookshelf Stacking,1!,1,"With this, Cheshire can erect a bookshelf from the ground. This bookshelf contains a large number of books, all with a predetermined, common subject matter or genre. Bookshelves from this can be used as barriers, but what’s even more sophisticated about them is the amount of knowledge gained from the books ON the shelves. Once per round 44. Stacked Bookshelf Stacking - When you would use bookshelf stacking you may spend an additional stamina to create another bookshelf directly on top of the first, with a ladder allowing you to reach the top books. "
ability,Cheshire,Marking The Spot,1!,2,"Cheshire knows when he’ll want to return to something that got stopped short, and as such, has developed a bookmark ability. With it, he can bookmark “something” to return to a pre-selected “previous state”. This can be interpreted as making someone move to a previous spot they were standing in, reverting them back to a point earlier in the combat where they were on fire, etc. Placing the bookmark is what requires the roll, while activating it can then happen whenever Cheshire pleases. Once per round on both of these activations."
ability,Cheshire,It's A Long Story,3⛯,1,Cheshire gives an excerpt from one of his favorite books. Naturally he loves the articulation but literally everyone else is super bored of all these words that mean nothing and start to fall asleep. Cheshire emits a 10 foot sleep aura. Any enemy targets within this aura have to roll to stay awake. Recurrent cost of one. Once per combat.
ability,Cheshire,Quiet In The Library,1!,1,"If someone would use an anytime to stop one of your non Personal Library abilities, you can stop them from activating it by silencing them, since all anime characters Must say their power's Name, they stop. Once per round. 59. Quiet in the library can be used when any of your abilities from your catalogue would be interrupted. This does not cap per round but each use increases the cost by one."
ability,Cheshire,Like A Story Come To Life,3,2,Creates a copy of the person whose page Cheshire is currently on. The summon has 12 stamina and follows Cheshire's orders but otherwise is the same person(including that person’s weapon). If Cheshire uses an anytime from that person's page the summon cannot use it and vice versa. If you switch pages the summon disappears.
ability,Cheshire,MR. SPIDER!?!?!?!?!?,5⛯,,"If this card is drawn, put it back into your deck and draw again. It’s Mister Spider but at 5 stamina (no stamina costs)."
ability,Cheshire,Hiding in Plain Sight,3,,"As a free action on Cheshire's turn, he may manifest and put on a 'mask.' He has to hold a hand to his mask (it's oddly heavy), but so long as it's on his face, everyone viewing him sees him as ""An ally/Someone who makes sense to be here."" But he isn't completely exempt from all suspicion. If he does something suspicious, like attacking someone or doing sabotage, can break the 'persona' the mask has. General features about the 'masked man' are impossible to make out, and there is a very light epithetical signature coming from Cheshire while he remains masked. Upkeep 2. 8 - Professionalism - Cheshire can, while the Mask is in use, switch it to be able to a mediocre night vision, or switch it to a thermal vision. Doing so forces 1 additional Upkeep cost as well, both because of the mask getting just the slightest bit heavier and straining the Alias further. 13 Multifaceted - When using Hiding in Plain Sight Cheshire may, instead of becoming simply an ambiguous ally, choose to don the appearance of someone within his direct line of sight. Inconsistencies such as physique or speaking mannerisms are glossed over when the mask is observed, but very suspicious actions, locations, or sudden out of character questions and statements may still shatter the persona. While utilising this variation, Cheshire may fool retina and voice recognition security systems -security camera footage and recording devices may pick up his actual form with a blurry mask, and his original voice -if the camera or recording device is far enough away."
ability,Baku Baku No Mi,Combination Surprise,X,,"Combine up to X objects within you, cobbling their pieces together to create something new! You can use it immediately alongside this action, with the same roll."
ability,Baku Baku No Mi,Hunger Install,3⛯,,"Extend your jaw, before performing an ouroboros and eating yourself. This briefly pops you out of existence for around 5 turns on initiative. Afterwards, you pop back into being, having combined yourself with… yourself! This gives you a x1.5 modifier to your movement speed and a boost in effectiveness on all your powers. Your stamina costs including upkeeps are all reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0), and you even lose some weight! These effects stop at the end of combat. Once per combat."
weapon,Johnny,These Two Fists,,,"Johnny's only Weapon are his bare hands, however; if he rolls above 15 on an attack he can try for a follow-up punch as a free action. A punch only has 1 range and 5 damage. 30. Johnny gets a +1 to damage after he delivers a topical or badass one-liner. 40. Zoom Punch: +1 damage 47. Rolls above 15 grant two follow up attacks instead of one. 51. Zoom Punch: +1 Damage"
talent,Johnny,Nige Run Dayo,,,"When at half or lower max health, if Johnny double moves he may instead “triple move”. This only applies when double moving."
talent,Johnny,Star Sunglasses,,,"Johnny gives someone a pair of his sunglasses, this can only be done after something occurs that would put Johnny in what he believes is a Life-Debt. This character's last name is partially changed to ""star"". For Example, Nova Sakuga would become Nova Sakustar. This character cannot change their name back, nor do they really have a choice in accepting the glasses."
talent,Johnny,Is THaT a MOtherFUkIn JoJo REferENce?,,2,You can point out jojo references for one stamina.
passive,Johnny,The Chosen One,,,"Because Johnny's the main character, he gets to be the one with the cool finishers! Whenever an ally crits, they can choose to instead reroll and give that crit to Johnny to be stored for later use by him. 26. Stored crits grant prof 43 Character Arc: Chosen One 20s can now be used on ally actions. They may also gain proficiency from them. 58 Chosen One can now save 20s without taking them from the original roller. 84. Jo-Bros for Life - Despite his often cold exterior of solemn badassery, Johnny cares for those he fights along with very deeply in his own special way. Whenever storing a critical success with Chosen One, Johnny harnesses the essence of the person who crit and mixes it with the stored crit. When replacing a roll with this stored 20, Johnny or the person it is applied to can choose to modify the action they are performing with a property of the person who granted Johnny this stored crit or the action they performed to give Johnny that stored crit. If storing a crit from a Wonderstar family member, this effect is boosted."
passive,Johnny,Back in Black,,,"Back in Black is able to activate on Johnny’s turn as a free action. Doing so has it appear adjacent to Johnny, and it cannot be recalled until the start of Johnny’s next turn. Damage dealt to Back in Black is redirected back to Johnny. Back in Black functions in two main ways; For one, it has very high Destructive Power, and is able to use it to assist Johnny with his punk-pummeling. B.i.B. can be manifested up to 15 ft away from Johnny at any given time, and can use its movement action to move anywhere within that radius. Using Johnny’s main action, he can spend 3 stamina to have Back in Black perform a punch rush, dealing 8-11 damage initially, and, if he pays an additional 2 stamina, allowing Back in Black to move up to 3 spaces in a straight line, dragging any hit units along with it to deal additional damage to all of them. If Johnny is adjacent to Back in Black upon it activating a punch rush, he can move along with it assuming the 2 additional stamina is paid. As a bonus action, Johnny can spend 1 stamina to have Back in Black perform a singular punch on a chosen target. This usually deals around 4-6 damage, but its primary function is high knockback. Johnny is also able to funnel any damage dealt from this attack into more knockback. This bonus action is able to be used at any point during Johnny’s turn, including as an interrupt or during one of Johnny’s combos. Along with its raw strength, Back in Black has its main ability, called “Family Matters”. It costs 3 stamina to perform as a bonus action, and with it, Back in Black sends one of its hair strands towards a living creature within 5 spaces of itself. From this point on, the two are connected as the hair strand acts as a connecting root. While connected, Back in Black, and Johnny himself by extension, gain power from the creature’s bloodline. This allows them to add properties of the bloodline to their actions, as well as create one temporary ability based on said bloodline. Said ability cannot be more than a 5 cost, unless it is an X cost. Once Family Matters has been activated, Back in Black must stay active for it and Johnny to benefit from it. The exception to this is if Johnny connects the root to himself. Doing so allows him to pull from the powers of any of his family members, along with anyone who has been affected by his Star Sunglasses Talent. Even if Back in Black is de-summoned, this effect stays in place for as long as Johnny wants/is able to maintain. On that, maintaining the effect of Family Matters has an upkeep cost of 2 stamina at the start of Johnny’s turns."
ability,Johnny,When Did He Do That?,2!,,"Whisper to the GM of a reaction that you have planned, and how it works. If the trigger is met, Johnny may dramatically declare how he had already been 3 steps ahead! The more outlandish/specific the trigger the easier it works. This is done during your turn but you don't roll or pay cost until it is activated. You can only have one trigger set up at a time. (Setting up is a free action on your turn) You can have three triggers set at a time, only one can be set in a turn. 13. Can set two triggers total, one per turn 37. Cost reduced by 1 to 2, trigger cap now at 3."
ability,Johnny,Utility Belt,1!,,"Take off a belt and use it to do something simple, range of within 20 feet, twice per round. 17. +5 foot range 32. Twice per round."
ability,Johnny,Ora Ora Ora,3⛯,,"Basic attack 3 times. The above 15 clause still applies to each attack. Once Per Combat. 71. 3 Page Ora - If Johnny is at 5 or less Stamina, and the majority of the damage (including Stamina Cost) he has taken has been from a single enemy, then, once per session, he can use Ora Ora Ora two times at once on said enemy, only paying the standard 3 stamina. He can choose to do one collective roll or two separate, but this choice must be made before any rolls occur."
ability,Johnny,The Last of my Stamon(a)(Remaining Stamina),X⛯,,"Johnny may pass on his remaining energy when he is at one third or less max health to an ally. This allows an ally to go over max Stamina. It also gives them Johnny's passive until the end of combat. Once Per Combat. 64. Stamona Beat - The Last of My Stamon(a) now has an alternate variation where Johnny takes a deep, purposeful breath as his body is filled with the power of the sun and life itself. Johnny is reduced to either 5 or 1 stamina (his choice), causing a yellow aura to surround his body. Depending on the amount of stamina spent for this ability, Johnny gets a scaling power boost for the next 2-3 rounds of combat. When in this state, along with said power boost, all of Johnny’s attacks are imbued with both fire and light element, he can walk on liquids without issue, and he can also imbue objects/weapons with his energy to manipulate them. Activating this version of the ability is a Bonus Action."
ability,Johnny,Bloody Stream,4,,"Johnny pulls out a pendant with a large, brilliantly shining red jewel in the center. Upon doing so, the world shifts color palette, with the only thing staying the same being the jewel. Along with this, effect-kanji begin emanating around Johnny, as the jewel starts glowing deeply. From here, the jewel must be charged for the rest of the round, and at the start of Johnny’s next turn it fires a massively powerful 3xinfinite beam dealing around 12-18 damage at base. If the battlefield has a particularly good view of the sun on a sunny day, this damage may be increased. Along the beam itself, Johnny can influence the aforementioned color palette change and effect-kanji in order to try and produce secondary effects upon the beam’s firing. If Johnny is in Stamon Beat form, this ability does not need to charge, instead being fired immediately. Once per Combat."
weapon,Solomon,The Silver Eagle,,,"Solomon’s signature sword. 6 Damage, 1 Range. Solomon can perform different impromptu techniques with his sword, exchanging damage for some effects such as prone, knockback, or bleed. Part of Myself - Because of his prolonged use of it, the Silver Eagle is considered a part of Solomon’s body, and subsequently is affected by his passive, provided he is making some sort of physical contact with it."
passive,Solomon,"Body, Soul, Shadow",,,"Solomon’s form is unbreakable. While he can take damage, unless he wills it, his body, soul, and shadow are unable to be altered by outside forces. This means he is immune to the bleed status, as well as any other statuses that involve cutting, piercing, or breaking open his body in any way. He’s just immune to that stuff in general. His soul and shadow are also immune to being taken out of his body or broken in general. Again, he can take all the damage of these things happening, if anything it’s slightly reduced, but he is immune to the specific effects. 26. Three in One - Solomon’s may be unable to be morphed by outside forces, but that doesn’t mean he can’t influence his own body, soul and shadow. Whenever Solomon would use his epithet in a way that would influence/change his body, soul, or shadow; he can pay an amount of stamina determined by the GM to have that change persist as long as they spend half of the amount of stamina as upkeep."
passive,Solomon,Shadows from the Limelight,,,"Solomon has been able to tell that the more attention certain items or individuals have the more his epithet begins to resonate with it. With these items/people Solomon is able to take a portion of their Body, Soul, or Shadow (called a Noma) and add it to his soul ring. While a Noma is in the soul ring Solomon can attempt to incorporate them into his kit in whatever way feels reasonable. He’s only able to use one Noma at a time and the more he uses it in combat the less potent it becomes. As of now there isn’t a limit to how many Noma that he can carry within his soul ring that Solomon is aware of."
ability,Solomon,Penumbral Moulding,X,,"The body affects the shadow, twisting it and contorting it, but the reverse is also possible if some influence is applied. If the shadow is visible in the current lighting, Solomon can reshape an adjacent object by changing the shape of its shadow. This cannot actually change its properties or what it is, only its shape. If Solomon succeeds in doing this with his sword, he immediately gets a free basic attack with it. Cost is dependent on how much energy Solomon puts into the ability, which will reflect on the potency of the ability. Stamina cap is 5."
ability,Solomon,Self-Armament,2!,,"Solomon’s sovereignty over his body allows him to harden it at the drop of a hat. In an instant, it becomes hard as steel, deflecting damage and potentially reflecting projectiles. This can also be used to make his sword temporarily unbreakable, increasing its damage and bypassing all DR. Once per round."
ability,Solomon,Fleetfoot Manuever,3⛯,,"Pushing his soul and body to its absolute limits, Solomon dashes faster than the human eye to strike down every individual he wishes to extinguish for the combat. Once this move is initiated, Solomon identifies each and every target he wants to take down, and then dashes forward to attack. Solomon begins moving at speeds that even he cannot comprehend. His movement doubles, but he must use all of it as a movement action on every turn while this is up. He cannot make any more than 2 turns in his movement path. Since he cannot see, is forced to attack the closest thing to him at the end of his movement path. He also cannot use any abilities except for his basic attack. In exchange for these drawbacks, the basic attack’s damage is given a +2, and will either knock the target prone or knock it back 2 spaces. This attack will either end if Solomon wills it or he goes unconscious. Upkeep 1. Once per combat."
weapon,Randall,The Saber of Valor,,,"Randall’s quite literal first action after he escaped was to steal a sword and his current outfit so that he could mentally associate himself with the one he had already become mentally. 6 damage, one range."
talent,Randall,*Eyetwitch*,,,"Ah. Hahaha. Ha. Uh. Could you be so kind as to not have me in this subspace you are creating? Dimensional shenanigans do not please me in the least, and as a Man of Valour, being in a sour mood is most unpleasant as I will not be as Valourous in nature. If Randall is dragged into someone’s personal pocket dimension or some other such bullshit the unhinged pieces of his original “self” rise higher to the surface of his personality. While this is going on he cannot use the Man of Valour Passive and instead uses the following: I Will Break Each And Every Bone In Your Body In Order - Randall has +2 crit range on damaging the owner of the dimension, as well as is capable of teleporting anywhere within the realm during his movement, attempting to find a way out but never being able to do so."
passive,Randall,A Man of Valor,,,"As you might have heard when he introduced himself, Randall is a Man of Valour, who has gone on the adventure of a thousand lesser men’s lifetimes. As a bonus action on his turn Randall can manifest an item from one of his many tens of thousands of adventures that he’s regretfully never actually had the capacity of doing physically. This is unrolled but has a variable stamina cost between 1 and 5. While taking actions that are befitting of an Explorer and person of high personal honor Randall has a +1 to his rolls. 19. I Am A Well Traveled Man! Allow Me To Regale You With My Achievements And Titles - An adventurer is only as fantastical as their adventures, and my adventures have been rather amazing if I do say so myself, yes indeed. After a combat/encounter, if Randall desires, he can choose to add onto his very Class Name, creating a Subtitle for it (ex. Valourous Adventurer: Conqueror of the Goons). For as long as the Subtitle is present on his Class Name, Randall gains a small, passive buff related to the Subtitle or the combat/encounter that inspired it. This buff may occasionally come at the cost of slightly weakening other things in Randall’s kit if the buff is substantial enough, but this generally does not occur. Whenever Randall would gain a Subtitle, he can pay variable amounts of Max Stamina (whether it is temporary or permanent is up to GM discretion) to instead regain the subtitle created from a previous combat/encounter."
ability,Randall,A Most Glorious of Retreats,1!,,"Randall is not in the state of being in which he enjoys incredible pain inflicted on himself, no-can-do. Randall’s body completely fades from existence for a moment before reappearing somewhere within 8 spaces. Once per round."
ability,Randall,Swashbuckler’s Swagger,1/3,,"Randall uses his more advanced sword technique stance which is capable of one of the two following depending on his effort: Riposte (1): Randall enters a prepared stance, ready to intercept and counter. When an attack would enter his melee range he may spend one stamina to parry/deflect it. This can work on any sort of attack regardless of whether it makes sense for him to be able to counter it. If he succeeds he may then spend another stamina to counter-attack if they are in range. He may do this full chain of actions twice per round each. This stance ends at the start of the turn in initiative he entered the stance. Thrust (3): A simple forward lunge with The Saber of Valour, this attack has +1d4 damage, inflicts 2 bleed, and has +2 crit range. On a crit the d4 is exploding."
ability,Randall,This Young Monkey Boy Gives Me Joy!,X,,"Randall has an incredible love for adventure and romanticism! He has not had the ability to enjoy fiction as published by normal people, instead being stuck with stories he had to think up on his own for 20 years. So now that he can enjoy actual popular media, he's found a quite wonderful little comic about a stretchy pirate, and wishes to pay his respects to such a spectacular series. Randall may roll 1dx where X is the current amount of one piece chapters, and may manifest an effect based on the chapter rolled. If Soleil is present, and the chapter is a major spoiler, he may reroll chapter number."
weapon,Pal,Ehhhhhhhhhh,,,"Pal slaps someone adjacent to his host with his little baby hands. 2 damage one range, inflicts a -2 to the target's next action. 17. Gimme a Boostie, Maaaaaaaaaaaaan - The range of Ehhhhhhhhhh is now equal to his host’s basic weapon range +1 as Pal climbs onto it to hit his target. This only applies if the host’s basic weapon is something that can be physically climbed without being completely detached from his host. So, for example, Pal cannot use the range of a gun’s bullets, considering he’d need to ride a bullet to do so."
weapon,Pal,Gun,,,5 range
talent,Pal,"Su Casa, Mi Casa",,,The person Pal is currently attached to is considered his User and as such stuff that they get he also gets! Any healing or other beneficial effects the user receives he also gets at half effectiveness.
talent,Pal,George Took Spanish Class Once,,,Pal wasn’t really paying attention for the most part but took in the gist of it. Due to epithetical energies he can translate vague inter-lingual skills into every language but English is his most skilled language. 
passive,Pal,"Listen Man, It'll Be A Couple Days At Most, Promise",,,"Due to Pal's intrinsic nature of being one of the laziest motherfuckers alive he refuses to move on his own. As a full round action he can teleport to a target within what his movement should be (base 6) and attach to their back. Regardless of whatever they should try, they cannot remove Pal unless they’re put under an effect that nullifies epithets, and even then, if and when the effect wears off he will return. However while he might be a leach Pal does offer a few benefits: He will take half of the damage his current host takes from attacks only taking a Maximum of 1.5x total damage if both are targeted by an AoE or the like. The host also counts as being allies with all targets for the purpose of moving past targets with a move action. Lastly, if the target pays him 2 permanent max stamina as a severance fee he'll cut his losses and jump from them as an anytime and mark them as someone he can't bum off of anymore. "
ability,Pal,Remi-nder to Move Those Legs Friend-o,1,,"Pal ain’t moving his legs but with enough annoyance he can get his host to walk for him. Kinda like that one movie George saw when he was a kid like that funky little rat did. We should watch that movie when we go home tonight dude. Move Action, Once per your turn."
ability,Pal,Here’s Looking At You Kid,2!,,"Due to how his Existence works Pal can make his epithet definition a bit more flexible and lower the cost of things within 3 spaces. Primarily this can be used on stamina costs to make them 0, or lower them to like 2 cost if they’re above base 3. Cannot be used on his own abilities Once per round."
ability,Pal,You Got This Buddy,1,,"Straining his arms more than he’d really like to, Pal grabs his host’s arm to force them to pump it into the air to get in the mood to do shit, particularly to Pal’s benefits. The next action they take has a +2, or if it benefits Pal directly they roll and so does Pal and the better result is taken. 14. Join the Crib, Bro - Pal can choose one ally adjacent to him/his host. Pal has two hands so he reaches over to this ally and also has them fist pump. This gives them either a +1 on their next action or if Pal pays an extra stamina a +2 on their next action. Doing this also gives his host a +1 on their next action after they utilize the +2 buff of this ability."

passive,Serlea,Let's Up the Stakes,,,"Every time someone would succeed their failure range is increased by one, only resetting on a failure. This includes Serlea. If someone critically succeeds while their failure range is increased they gain their failure modifier as bonus proficiency, if the action would not grant it it instead now grants half the extended range. 15 - Eyes on The Prize - Characters that are affected by Let’s up the Stakes can decide to increase the DC of their next action by 5 in order to have their action’s effect be multiplied by (X-10)/2 X being the natural roll number. A crit only grants half the amount of prof while this is in effect. The DC increase of this upgrade does not grant additional prof. If they fail this action their failure range from Let’s Up The Stakes does not go away. Bounty Mechanic: You get the choice to keep your patch note as a thing on your kit, with stronger things being once per combat per session - Serlea may choose to change her failure range increase into a critical fail range increase to additionally increase critical success range. She must choose whether her passive is in increased fail range or crit fail range mode at the start of her turn and cannot change it until 2 of her turns later. If a target crits on a result that is half or less of their failure range away from 20, she gains proficiency from her passive as if they rolled a 20 on something that wouldn't give them proficiency."
passive,Serlea,Challenge Breeds Innovation,,,"All NPCs present at the start of combat you are in get +3 max stamina (permanently), a 1 cost once per round dodge roll, and a single natural 20 to apply to any roll of their choice. If combat is won The PCs may choose a second combat reward which gives them half rounding down its value, special reward bonuses from other characters cannot apply to the second choice."
ability,Serlea,Legendary Trial,X,,Serlea is capable of accessing powers related to a set of the hardest challenges that have ever existed. This ability can cause one of the Twelve Herculean labors to manifest in some form with the cost being relevant to the effect brought about and how long you wish for it to last. Certain effects being used can turn this ability into a Once Per Combat.
ability,Serlea,Scaling Rewards,4⛯,,"As a bonus action that costs no stamina on her first turn Serlea can specify an action with some specific conditional statement/notable thing about it (ex. Melee range, an anytime, something that is only utility) and every time that action is failed (before people mess with it to try and force a success) she can track it and later in combat on her turn she can properly activate this ability to create a positive buff or healing etc that gets stronger with the more stacks she’s gathered. Once per combat."
ability,Serlea,DC Increase,1!,,Permanently raise the difficulty of an action for everyone for the rest of combat. This can only be used 5 times per combat. If an action that would succeed is now at this threshold it instead fails.
ability,Serlea,6 Hard-Cap,2,,"By placing a hand on an adjacent target you can put a limit on how strong they are, limiting their total damage they are capable of dealing to each target they would attack per round. Generally this lowers their max per target to 12. This lasts for two rounds."

passive,Tenacious,Stand Users Attract Stand Users,,,"While you may not originally be from this world you have a skill which apparently exists in this world as well, that of the Stand. However, stand users of this world are not as intrinsically drawn to each other as they are in your world, at least not to each other.

Due to how your epithet works these temporal effects only change events right after you use this ability despite always being that way, regardless of the time paradoxes that creates in the past. Those aren’t your problem. [ULTIMATE]  If Clarisse wants, she can use this to instead create a copy of herself who has these changes."
ability,Clarisse,Put It On Repeat,3,,"Clarisse sends an action that was just performed forwards in time, facing a direction of her choice. This lets her recreate attacks from earlier in this combat at will. Clarisse can choose to spend a 2 stamina upkeep to have this ability repeat again at the start of her turns. She can only do this in combat once per ability."
weapon,Akhen,Cerimonial Khopesh,,,"While it is a sword, it wasn’t meant for actual combat and is a tad dull, 5 damage melee range. "
talent,Akhen,Sandman,,0,Any liquids splashed on Akhen evaporate after a whole round.
passive,Akhen,Water's up with that?,,0,"Akhen’s epithet and powers render his body permanently deprived of moisture, hence his appearance. When he would become wet all his powers receive a -5 for the duration, but his basic attacks receive a +3 to roll and +1 to damage."
ability,Akhen,Sand Armor,3⛯,0,"Encapsulating himself in a layer of sand, Akhen takes -3 damage from basic attack damage. Costs 1 stamina per round to maintain. Getting it wet reduces effectiveness. Once per combat."
ability,Akhen,Don't Sweat it,1!,0,"When a person is nervous/afraid/not confident in themselves, they sweat. Akhen can evaporate it, subconsciously improving their capacity to perform under duress. +3 to a roll. Once per round."
ability,Akhen,"Oh, Mister Sandman!",3,0,"Akhen creates multiple clones of himself made of sand, you can have however many clones you want but they must have 15 stamina split evenly amongst them. While this isn't once per combat, you cannot use this ability again until all the clones made by this are gone."
weapon,Clio,THE LEGENDARY ARM BLADES,,,"7 Damage, 1 Range. A pair of two long, curved blades that pop out of Clio’s forearms. 18+ rolls will result in an especially good cut that causes a bleed status. (Prof 21) Getting Sharper - THE LEGENDARY ARM BLADES get +1 damage."
talent,Clio,*CRONCH*,,,"Clio has the ability to make her teeth sharp and serrated, causing her bites to hurt a lot more than they normally would, and potentially cause bleed."
talent,Clio,Knife Walk,,,"With Clio’s immunity to her own blades and her decent ninja skills, she’s developed a technique that gives her an edge in stealth. Whenever she steps on any of her knives, she gets an extra movement, and up to half of her remaining movement can be spent as a straight leap, avoiding whatever was on the spaces she was jumping on. This can continue as long as she still has movement to spend and knives to jump on. Additionally, whenever she utilizes this, her movements are completely silent."
passive,Clio,KNIVES UPON KNIVES UPON KNIVES UPON-,,,"Clio always is sure to do what she does best - summon some wicked sharp blades! At any point in her turn, Clio can summon up to 3 knives anywhere on the field that she can see. These knives will only be one space long, are easy to destroy if targeted, and deal around 2-5 damage upon being hit, depending on how the target landed on them. Clio can spawn these knives on any matter, including on liquids or gasses. However, once summoned, the knives will interact with the material how they normally would (Sinking through liquids, falling through gasses, etc.). This passive also ensures that it is impossible to puncture Clio with her own blades, no matter the circumstance."
ability,Clio,BUTCHER'S SPECIALTY,X,,"Sure, Clio’s knives are pretty potent, but since her Epithet’s primary way of causing harm is able to be avoided or resisted, she’ll need to adapt to her opponents. As a bonus action, Clio can augment one knife that she will create during her turn, whether through her abilities or passive, to have some kind of special property. This can range from it being bigger to its temperature being hotter or colder to it being lighter so it deals less damage but it’s harder to dodge through anytimes. However, nothing too crazy can be done, the main limitation is if its augmentation could be reasonably done to a real knife through non-Epithet means. If a knife from an ability is augmented through this, its success will have an invisible boost, which may be greater depending on how simple the augmentation is. The cost will be dependent on the effectiveness of the augmentation."
ability,Clio,KILL CHOP DELUXE,3+X⛯,,"Brandishing her two arm blades with a glint in her eye, Clio goes in for her ultimate attack. Clio bursts her movement forward, slicing all enemies in the way. If she is adjacent to a blade of her creation, and its current position can cause harm (Ie. protruding out of a wall rather than being flat on the floor), she can bounce off of it and repeat this until she is unable to. However, every time an enemy that was hit is hit again, the cost for this ability goes up by 2. Once per combat."
ability,Clio,GUILLOTINE GATLING,2,,"Spinning her arms in circles in front of her, Clio manifests as many blades as she can and fires them at a target 6 spaces in front of her. Each blade will deal 3 damage, and a 1d4 will be rolled to decide how many knives are created, alongside the original roll. If the roll to activate this ability is low, but the amount of knives created are a 3 or a 4, the ability will still work, but the actual amount of knives will be reduced as a penalty. This also has the capability to injure certain parts of the body if focused down with multiple blades, or pin people or things to the wall by affixing their clothes to nearby surfaces."
weapon,Pip,Dice Barrage,,,"Pip reaches into her pockets and pulls out a handful of multicolored and numbered gemstones and tosses them out, doing minor damage but imbuing them with negative roll energy. 3 range 2 damage, inflicts a -d4 to the target’s next roll."
talent,Pip,You Cannot Hide From Fate,,,"Due to the way her eyes work, one cannot GMroll effectively against Pip, and she is made aware of all rolls being made, so long as they are using traditional dice values."
passive,Pip,Potent Portents,,,"Being that the world itself functions off the rolling of dice, you are in a notably higher level of preparedness than others. You directly see any and all 3D Dice rolls made, and can use them to tell the future. At the start of your turn you may roll 1d20 and 1dx (where x is the amount of turns in initiative, starting from the highest initiative as one and going down). You may use that dice result during their turn (not necessarily on them, just in that turn), needing to roll to apply it to an enemy if it would force a bad result. You may spend stamina in one point intervals to get more d20s on other turns, all dice disappear at the start of your next turn. 16: The Foresight To Duck - Pip is immune to any weird meta-mechanics that involve the 3D Dice targeting them, as they’re able to perceive them far ahead of time. 26: Bump - Pip can guide fate along a desired axis to an extent, although this can be highly taxing. Whenever she rolls a die, she can spend 3 stamina and shift that die’s natural value up or down by one. This cannot make a die roll above or below it’s usual max, it cannot be used if the die rolled its minimum result, and it can’t cause a roll to grant proficiency because of its new roll."
ability,Pip,D4C,3⛯,,"Pip’s epithet allows her to see into the future and other timelines, and by straining a lot of energy she can even pull over visions of herself from those possible worlds. Summons 1d4 6 stamina clones of Pip, any anytime/passive usages are shared between all of them. These Pips already knew they were about to be dragged over and as such have one main action prepared to be taken the turn they are summoned. Once per combat."
ability,Pip,D10 Cannon,2,,"Pip takes out one of her dice and rests it on her thumb before focusing an incredible amount of energy in her pointer finger and flicking it at a target of her choice she can see. This does 1d10+2 damage, maximum of 6 with said roll bonus, higher numbers do their listed number flat. On a natural 10 the target is knocked prone and takes 1d2 stack of bleeds."
ability,Pip,D20 Dystopia,X⛯,,"Pip draws in as many potential futures as she can handle all at once, then enacting a plan with the gathered information. She may spend upwards of 5 stamina on this ability and roll an equal amount of d20s (aside from the roll to cast this ability) and then guide herself and allies in a chain of actions using those dice as stand-ins for what they would roll to take the action as. Once per combat."
ability,Pip,D6 Fix,1,,"A very simple ability, Pip touches an adjacent target and lets some energy flow into them, sealing any wounds, giving them 1d6 stamina. Can also be used on items."
ability,Pip,D1 Determinism,1!,,"Pip extends their hand and forces the one inevitable outcome to come to fruition. This forces any die roll that isn’t for an action’s success to be a natural 1, for example rollable tables. You can use this on non-dice random chance events to force an unfavorable outcome as well, though this can’t be done to interrupt or weaken main actions. Once per round."
ability,Pip,D12 Candela,2,,"Pip creates a miraculous flash of light through a prismatic die, causing them to roll a d12. A target within 6 range takes either 5 damage or the die result’s damage, whichever is higher. On a 9 or higher (from the d12), D12 Candela also blinds the target momentarily, giving them a roll debuff until the end of their next turn. On a 12 or higher (from the d12), they are also lit on fire for 1d6 damage a round. On a 1 or lower (from the d12), D12 Candela heals 5 instead of dealing 5 damage."
weapon,Dwayne,The Actual Black Mail,,,"6 Damage 1 Range. Dwayne’s Epithet manifests as a black envelope that usually contains one’s deepest, darkest secrets, but it can also hurt like a bitch when used as a regular weapon. (Prof 21) Cutting Correspondence - The Actual Black Mail’s damage is increased by 1 (5 to 6), and high rolls inflict a bleed status effect by giving nasty paper cuts."
talent,Dwayne,Slight of Hand Penman,,,"Due to the speed that he needs to write in order to activate some of his abilities, Dwayne’s hands are ridiculously fast and dexterous. This allows him to write very fast in general, and also allows him to perform sleight of hand tricks and maneuvers with great ease, rolling with advantage or bypassing a roll entirely depending on the action."
talent,Dwayne,"""Master"" of Appraisal",,,"Dwayne’s not only figured out how to siphon secrets from people, but now he can take them from objects as well. By touching an object with his black envelope, Dwayne can learn something important about it. However, secrets from these objects aren’t actually letter secrets he can use, simply messages being projected into his head. A roll will be made upon activating this, but success will be guaranteed no matter what - failures, crit or not, will just make the description far more vague."
passive,Dwayne,You've Got Mail!,,,"Look at that, Dwayne just got a letter! It’s solid black, and it has something inside of it. Dwayne pulls it out to see none other than a slip of paper detailing a secret of someone in the very room they are in! A 1dX shall be rolled, X being the amount of people in the combat aside from Dwayne himself. However, if Dwayne has 5+ companionship with anyone, he can choose to omit them from this passive. Dwayne’s player will be DMed the secret, and he can choose to blurt out the secret or keep it hidden. However, no matter what, the black letter will have the target’s name written on it. If the target of the passive is an ally, Dwayne can empower them with the knowledge of the idea that he has something of theirs, giving them a +3 on all of their rolls, with a 1 stamina upkeep. If an enemy is the target of this ability, they get a +5 on all rolls attacking Dwayne, but a -5 when attacking anyone else, due to their fixation on keeping their secret kept. On top of that, any attacks to Dwayne will cost 1.5x the normal stamina (Rounded down) due to the utter desperation to keep their secrets hidden, or at least to see what secret is in there (If their personality wouldn’t make them do this, Dwayne’s Epithet will). If Dwayne reads the secret out loud, the benefits are lost, and the person who had the secret takes 5 damage. He can only do this as a free action on his turn. On top of this, Dwayne has the ability to add aspects of this secret to the battle! He can either apply any aspect of what was written into his attacks to either augment or boost them, or he can spend a main action to essentially add an aspect to any part of the battle he can, with the stamina spent being determined by the GM. Due to how his powers work, Dwayne’s black envelope can also fit in more secrets and threats, manifesting them into reality. However, since his envelope is an envelope, it can’t fit too much into it, only allowing 3 other Envelope Slots in it. This allows any persistent effects to be dispelled as a free action. If the passive secret is revealed, it too can be tossed out, opening a fourth Envelope Slot. (Prof 27) Call it a Callback! - Dwayne’s memory has significantly improved, and it allows him to reapply secrets that he has taken in before. By utilizing his passive application and spending X+1 stamina, X being the amount of sessions with Dwayne that have passed since he acquired said secret, Dwayne can utilize any of his previous secrets. (Prof 33) Fine, I’ll Pick a Side - Dwayne can now choose whether he draws a secret from his allies or his enemies. If there is only one person on the side he chooses, the secret will not be something as deep. (Prof 37) Extradimensional Envelope - Dwayne gets +3 Envelope Slots (3 to 6)!"
ability,Dwayne,Don't Do It - Or Else!,3!,,"Dwayne sees a dangerous attack happening from an opponent about to happen, and he points his envelope at the attacker and immediately threatens that if they do it, something awful will happen to them, as he slips a small piece of paper into the envelope. The target of this ability can choose whether or not they will perform their ability. If they do not choose to do it, they will pay the stamina cost of their ability but not perform it. If they do choose to do the ability despite the warning, a horrible effect or event that Dwayne wrote on the slip of paper he slipped on the envelope will happen to the target of this ability, regardless of how logical it is to happen. Before the choice, the player will DM another player of what this horrible effect is. Due to this fact being often immediate, this won’t take up an Envelope Slot normally, but if the effect is persistent, then it will take up a slot. Stamina cost is dependant on the effect, but if the effect does not go through, it is reduced to a 1 cost. Once per round. "
ability,Dwayne,I’m in Charge Here!,X,,"Brandishing the fact that he has supremacy over whoever he has the secret of, Dwayne commands this person to take an entire turn. If this is an ally, this is more of a symbolic gesture, as Dwayne is simply pouring power into them to take an extra turn. However, Dwayne still is holding power over them, so if they do what he says, they get a +2 to their rolls and an extra movement, but if they do their own thing, they get a -2 to their rolls and one less movement (The modifier from the secret bonus does not come into play here). If Dwayne has the secret of an enemy, then this ability almost acts as a sort of hypnosis effect, as Dwayne utilizes their desperation created from his Epithet and twists it into them taking an action and a movement that is beneficial to him. Double movement is an option in both of these instances. Anytimes cannot be used here. Dwayne pays all stamina costs made in this turn, and can move on his own before or after everything is done."
ability,Dwayne,I Heard a Rumor...,2,,"Dwayne’s power over secrets is so immense, that even lies about a target can become integral to them if he pitches it as something they’ve been hiding their whole life. Upon activation of this ability, Dwayne spreads a rumor about anyone on the field, while slipping a sticky note with said rumor into his envelope. Due to his natural charisma, people will initially believe him immediately, and the rumor will apply to the target. A numerical set of “Rumor Charges” will be placed on the target, which dictates the amount of actions they need to spend in order to dispel the rumor’s effects. If an amount of rounds equal to the Rumor Charges pass before all of said Rumor Charges are expended, the effectiveness is doubled. X equals the amount of Rumor Charges. The average strength rumor has a Rumor Charge of around 2-3. (Prof 35) Rumor Has It… - I Heard a Rumor changes in how it works a bit, due to Dwayne’s extensive training in the skill! It is effectively rewritten to be a better functioning ability."
ability,Dwayne,Mach Mailbox,1!,,"As Dwayne points at a desired spot, a lexical vanta black mailbox quickly springs up! This mailbox can be summoned on any solid surface, and is usually a space big and 1 - 2 spaces tall. This mailbox is primarily used to block attacks or bonk people at the most inconvenient moments, dealing around 3-5 damage. The mailboxes can persist beyond their creation, but can break if hit by a powerful attack or a few good regularly powered attacks. Once per round."
weapon,Gordon,Molten Manhandle,,,"6 Damage 2 Range. If you manage to catch a glimpse of Gordon’s hands before he pulverizes you, you’d notice that they appear as if they are constructed of molten rock. (Prof 65) Bursting with Force!! - Molten Manhandle gains +1 range (1 to 2. Along with this, Gordon can pay 1 stamina to cause his fists’ rock coating to explode outward, resulting in a stream of lava bursting from within. This causes the attack to count as physical damage, fire damage, or both (whichever would be most effective/whichever Gordon would prefer), and also grants the attack knockback equal to the amount of damage it deals. This variation of Molten Manhandle counts as Gordon using his Epithet."
talent,Gordon,Airtight Lungs,,,"Due to his intense training inside of volcanoes, Gordon has been able to get to a point where he essentially can hold his breath indefinitely without consequence."
talent,Gordon,Limited Dormancy,,,"At the start of every 3rd round of a combat, Gordon can produce a small lava plume under his feet and leap for up to an extra movement’s worth of spaces in any direction if he so desires."
talent,Gordon,Internal Furnace,,,"Gordon’s trained his inner heat so much, it makes all other temperatures null and void! Gordon takes reduced damage and effectiveness from hot (⅓) and cold (¾) effects. He is also entirely immune to the effects of his own Epithet powers."
talent,Gordon,Grotesque Eye Of The Gargoylian Dragon,,,"An Amulet made of one of the eyes of the Dragon Gargoyle, an early boss of the dungeon “Yatana’s Burial Ground”. The user of this amulet not only gains a natural resistance to petrification via turning to stone specifically but they may also, as a part of an action they are performing, pay 2 stamina to temporarily turn one of their body parts to stone gaining 2DR vs Physical and enhancing that action in a way that only turning their own body to stone would provide before it turns back to normal again. They may do this multiple times per combat, however,  if they do this 10 times in a session, a limb of their choice is permanently petrified. Once all limbs, the torso, and head are petrified in this manner, they die. This cannot be resisted."
passive,Gordon,Boiling Furnace,,,"Gordon doesn’t often leave chances for his opponents to hit him, but when they do, he’ll make sure to hit back three times harder. Each time he takes damage, Gordon gains an equivalent amount of Boil Points, which are stored as his red stat. Then, at any point, as a once per combat attack, Gordon can let loose his ultimate attack: The Pompei Cannon. This giant laser of lava is fired straight out of Gordon’s mouth, covering a 3 tile wide line, and it deals damage equal to the amount of total Boil Points Gordon has stored up. (Prof 60) To The Core - Gordon has honed his powers, and as such, has new ways to GAIN and SPEND Boil Points! Ways to Gain: If Gordon does not use his base Movement Action on his turn, roll 1d4+1. Gordon gains that many Boil Points. If Gordon is in Melting Point, instead roll 1d6!. If this explodes more than once, Gordon cannot gain Boil Points with this method for the rest of combat. If Gordon critically succeeds on a damaging action, he gains Boil Points equal to the base damage he would have dealt before any modifiers are applied (including the crit modifier). Gordon may pay up to 5 Stamina on his turn as a Bonus Action (functioning under the one Bonus Action per turn rule) to gain that many Boil Points as he allows his Epithet to burn him from the inside. To clarify, this must be rolled for. On a failure, this deals double damage to Gordon but does not grant him Boil Points. Similarly, on a crit success, the crit effect allows Gordon to pay up to 10 stamina to gain that many Boil Points instead of the normal 5. Gordon can willingly give himself Disadvantage on any roll, and if he does so, and manages to succeed the roll regardless, he gains Boil Points dependent on the effectiveness/degree of success on the roll. If he does this, no roll modifiers he may have apply to these rolls. Ways to Spend: Geyser Burst (X BP) - As a Movement or Bonus Action (functioning under the one Bonus Action per turn rule), Gordon can cause any source of lava/magma currently within 12 spaces of him to erupt. This includes himself if he is in Melting Point. The power/force/range of this eruption is dependent on both how many Boil Points Gordon spends as well as how large the source of lava/magma is, with larger amounts of both yielding greater results on a success. Cinder Flash (7X BP) - Can only be used after successfully performing an offensive Main Action. Gordon’s body flickers as cinders spark off of him, coating a hit target of the succeeded action. For every 7 Boil Points spent, they gain a stack of  “Cinder Burn”, which deals damage equal to the number of stacks on a unit at the start of their turn. The next time an afflicted unit is hit with a fire/lava/magma based attack, they take double the damage of their stacks and all stacks are removed. While afflicted with Cinder Burn, objects/enemies adjacent to them are prone to being set aflame, dealing minor damage and granting them stacks of Cinder Burn. Cinder Burn deals extra damage to summons and structures. Coulee Sprout (X BP) - As a Movement or Bonus Action (functioning under the one Bonus Action per turn rule), Gordon may pay up to 9 Boil Points to cause select parts of the ground to crumble and reveal a lava pit/stream underneath. For every 3 Boil Points spent, the amount of tiles this pit/stream can cover is increased. 3 BP = 1 Space, 6 BP = 4 Spaces, 9 BP = 9 Spaces. All spaces affected by this must be connected to each other, and Gordon cannot produce these pits/streams underneath spaces currently occupied by units."
ability,Gordon,Crack in the Crust,2,,"Gordon stomps on the ground, crushing its surface revealing a river of magma traveling in a 6-8 space line from where he initiated the attack. This river then stays on the battlefield until someone can do something to remove it. If anyone happens to fall into the magma, they take massive fire damage. (Prof 45) Cracking Under Pressure - Crack in the Crust can now produce 2 cracks at once, up to 90 degrees apart from each other, if Gordon pays 1 extra stamina point when using it."
ability,Gordon,Lava Loogie,1!,,"Gordon quickly spits out a short eruption of lava, which can either be used as a surprise attack dealing 3 damage, or as a way to redirect/enhance his movement/momentum. While this is a Lava “Loogie”, Gordon can technically shoot this out from any of his limbs. He just thinks the loogie method is the most entertaining. Once per round. (Prof 50) Things Are Really Heating Up! - For every 7 Boil Points that Gordon has, Lava Loogie’s damage is increased by one."
ability,Gordon,Melting Point,3⛯,,"Smoke begins forming from off of Gordon’s body as he roars out into the sky. His adrenaline levels go through the roof as he begins glowing and bright red-orange. While in this state, he gains +2 movement, a decent effectiveness buff to all of his attacks/abilities, and an extra Boil Point at the start of each of his turns. Not to mention, he gets a lot more energized. To maintain this form, he must pay 1 additional stamina at the start of each turn. Once per combat. (Prof 38) Hot to the Touch - Physically touching Gordon with one’s body while he is using Melting Point causes them to take a point of damage each time. (Prof 53) Immediate Eruption - Activating Melting Point is now a bonus action. Along with this, when Gordon is in Melting Point, he is able to create/manipulate small amounts of lava to potentially add extra effects onto actions taken."
ability,Gordon,Pop the Cork,3⛯,,"Raising his hand skyward, Gordon causes a piece of the ground to be shot skyward due to a sudden eruption from underneath it. This obviously carries anything that happened to be standing on that piece of ground with it. Also, there is a small crater of lava now left where the ground used to be. Once per combat."
ability,Gordon,Sootscreen,1!,,"With the largest grin imaginable, Gordon kicks up an absolutely massive amount of soot, clouding the surrounding area. He can either use this to blind the opposition temporarily or to mask his own movements, essentially giving him a hard to read teleport. The clouds created via this ability disappear after the initial interaction involving it is resolved. Once per round. (Prof 56) Soot Strengthening - Sootscreen now works as one ability with two variations. Gordon can only use one of these two variations within a round. Sootstorm (2) - After flashing a massively large grin, Gordon spits up a cloud of soot that occupies a 3x3 area. Any fire within the area is boosted tremendously, increasing the damage it deals by at least 1-2. Similarly, if any lava produced by Gordon is underneath the soot, Gordon can cause said lava to erupt and fire at something within 4 spaces as a once per round anytime. By paying an extra 1 stamina, this can be used as a bonus action."
ability,Gordon,Multi-Arm Pummel,5⛯,,Gordon rushes as a move action to a target of his choice and then sprouts two arms of lava from his shoulders and pummels said target within melee range. This technique hits four times as hard as a normal punch from him. Once per combat.  Brutish Beatdown (3) - Gordon pumps his arms before lunging up to half his movement speed away in a straight line to deliver a righteous one-two punch. This allows Gordon to make two melee basic attacks against a target within range whenever he chooses to end his movement.
ability,Gordon,Scoria Suplex,5⛯,,Gordon dashes up to a target as a move action and coats his arms in sheathe of magma before suplexing the target into the ground dealing double his basic attack damage embedding the target into the ground. This requires them to use a movement action in an attempt to escape although they are still prone. Once per combat. Seismic Slam (3) - Gordon takes a deep breath and sprints at a target up to half his movement speed away before pulling them into a heinous suplex. This normally deals 1.5x basic attack damage and forces the target prone but it may also be used to toss the target a few spaces away for half basic attack damage.
ability,Gordon,Warming Up,1,,"This technique may be used as a Bonus Action at the start of his turn. Gordon focuses his mind and prepares his body by calming his thoughts and performing a stretch, flex, or pose. This grants Gordon’s next physically based standard or movement action performed before the end of his turn a +1 to all existing statistics of his choosing; roll(s), damage, range, and knockback. Getting Hotter (3) - Gordon may choose to pay 2 additional Stamina as part of Warming Up to grant the bolstered action the properties of his Epithet… causing his body to literally heat up, further empowering himself. This allows him to add Epithet-related effects to the bolstered action and causes him to deal one fire damage to all objects and creatures that enter within one space of him, once per round, or directly make contact with him until the end of your turn."
weapon,Graves,Poetry of the Flesh,,,"5 Damage 1 Range. Within the finely woven canvas of human flesh, there can exist no imperfection. Graves is a master of mixed martial arts, and has learned to augment his fighting style with his lexical powers. Graves attacks a target in any manner he wishes, knocking them prone or shifting their position as he chooses on good rolls. The part of the target’s body that Graves aims at is temporarily weakened a bit, as every kick and sweep of his arm cuts like a jagged knife, sending blood and flesh splattering across the ground. This attack deals 1 additional damage for every stack of Scarred on the target, up to a maximum of 5 additional damage. (Prof 14) Suppression Methods - Graves can now use ‘Poetry Of The Flesh’ specifically to restrain targets, reducing their movement and weakening their actions for the next round or until they can break free.  Doing this still deals 2 damage to them, allowing Graves to steal an aspect of his choice, but no further damage is dealt based on Scarred stacks."
talent,Graves,Orders are Orders,,,"The country Graves served might be long gone, but this war is never over while he’s still breathing. For each session Graves is in, he has a secret purpose to fulfill that typically involves bringing him closer to the destruction of his enemies and the honor of those long dead. The GM will inform him of this ahead of time, and no matter how grisly or strange the task may be, he is compelled to follow it no matter what. The orders will never be something directly harmful to his allies, though it might certainly make things troublesome for them. If he follows these orders successfully, Graves received an additional 1 proficiency at the end of the session."
passive,Graves,Deep Red Scars,,,"Graves is a master of the artistry of human flesh - augmenting it, changing it, leaving it irrevocably marked. When Graves deals damage to a target, he can take one physical aspect of it and either immediately augment himself with it or save it for later use. These augmentations typically come in the form of increased defenses, a small damage buff, or some other physical property that makes sense with the taken aspect. In addition, the target is marked with a stack of ‘Scarred’ when it is damaged, which affects several of Graves’ abilities. If an ally rolls a 17+ when dealing damage to a Scarred target, the target takes 1 additional damage for each stack. (Prof 7) Coordinated Assault - Once per turn, when one of Graves’ allies deals 5 or more damage to an enemy with Scarred stacks with a single hit, another stack of Scarred is applied to that enemy. (Prof 8) Assisted Preparations - At the start of combat, Graves can immediately augment himself with the aspect of a willing ally without dealing damage to them."
passive,Graves,Reimburse Their Pain,,,"Each time Graves takes 5 damage in a combat, he is marked with one stack of Vengeance. The next time he deals damage to a target who has damaged him during this combat, he applies additional Scarred stacks equal to the stacks of Vengeance he has. Stacks of Vengeance are halved, rounded down, each time this effect occurs."
ability,Graves,Garden of Viscera,3,,"Undulating masses of flesh rise from cracks in the ground around Graves - the results of his many experiments and art projects, now under his glorious control. These masses of flesh can take either several smaller shapes or one larger one depending on Graves’ needs. They can take any form and perform any task that would be within the capabilities of animate bone and semi-liquid flesh. If Graves wishes, he can augment the summoned flesh with any of the properties he’s taken for himself thus far.  The total amount of flesh summoned with this ability when combined would take up a 3x3 icon or so. The flesh can act on each of Graves’ turns, dealing moderate damage if it attacks, though it tends to be fairly fragile depending on the form. Once per Combat. (Prof 10) Plenty Of Playthings - Garden Of Viscera is no longer once per combat. However, he can not use the ability two turns in a row, and each subsequent use will reduce his total summoning capabilities by half."
ability,Graves,Swift Punishment,2!,,"Graves doesn’t take kindly to his work being interrupted. Sneering angrily, he grabs hold of a target and squeezes, removing a large chunk of them to harshly weaken a particular aspect of them, as well as dealing 3 damage and marking them with two stacks of Scarred. He can then either augment himself with properties of the attack, or save the harvested flesh for later use. Once per round."
ability,Graves,Splice and Dice,1,,"Quick as a knife in the dark, Graves applies one of the aspects he has taken from the flesh of his targets to a new target that is adjacent to him. If he uses this on a target with three or more Scarred stacks, or on an ally, this ability rolls with advantage. If he chooses, he can apply the flesh augmentation quite forcefully, dealing 4 damage to the target, plus 1 additional damage for each Scarred stack up to a maximum of 3. The exact effects this new augmentation will have depends on exactly how he applies it, so it can be either beneficial or harmful."
ability,Graves,Dogmatic Strike,,,"As a bonus action, Graves grits his teeth and lunges towards an opponent with zealous fervor, dealing 8 damage to the target and knocking them backwards a bit. This attack pierces through most forms of physical defense, though not barriers created by magic, energy, or otherwise. Hitting a physical barrier or defense with this ability repeatedly will usually heavily weaken or even shatter it. This ability’s cost increases by 2 for every subsequent turn it is used.  The cost resets if not used during a turn, or used as a main action."
weapon,Cordelia,Today's Headline,,,3 Damage 2 Range. Cordelia takes the satchel filled to the brim with newspapers and swings it at an enemy! They’re pretty heavy.
talent,Cordelia,Truth Serum,,,"It is incredibly hard to lie to or around Cordelia, as her Epithet tends to flare up when she hears one."
talent,Cordelia,Master Bookkeeper,,,"Any book under the fictional genre (Even semi-fictitious ones) that Cordelia has on her person are empowered by her Epithet to the point where they are indestructible and unstealable. Not only is this useful for keeping the books under her passive safe, but it also allows her to use her books as potential cover, and she can store stuff one could normally fit into books into the books on her person to keep them protected."
passive,Cordelia,Taking Inspiration,,,"Cordelia is a MASSIVE bookworm, and she’s even trying to become an author herself. For now though, her Epithet got some fun it can do with the books she does have! At the start of a session, she can pick one from a selection of her various books, and she carries that book along with her for the session. Whenever she performs an action, she can take an aspect from the story inside and use it as a modifier on top of whatever she is doing. Along with this, Cordelia’s also taking her life experiences and writing them down in her notebook to help use as inspiration for her own stories! Throughout the duration and after a session she is a part of, Cordelia can take notes on anything that particularly stands out to her, and maybe even embellish a bit. If she ever wants to, she can then use these notes in her passive book slot for a session, but doing so prevents her from inputting notes from that session as her Epithet is currently using the notebook as an output. Cordelia’s Current Book List: “Inverse Grotto” - A fantasy story featuring a brother and sister duo wandering into a strange, labyrinthine forest that seems to make little sense. There’s plenty of fairies, monsters, and general weirdos around. “Of Galaxies and Starstuff” - A sci-fi Space Opera filled with juicy drama and even juicier spaceship fights! Beaming from planet to planet, seeing new sights, aliens galore! “Drifting Tumbleweed” - A shonen manga centered around cool cowboys with cowboy superpowers. Yeehaw! “Love: A Wild Ride” - A kid’s romance novel involving much school and many tropes. Cordelia’s far grown out of this by now, but it’s really nostalgic to her."
ability,Cordelia,Striking Headline!,X,,"Whoa! What an interesting person! Let’s write a story about them! Cordelia takes either an adjacent unit’s class name, or an action they have performed that has directly affected her, and twists into a bold, eye-catching new headline for the newspaper. Depending on what she writes, the effects and therefore stamina cost of this ability vary."
ability,Cordelia,Farther From the Truth,3⛯,,"Cordelia chooses someone on the battlefield, and then writes down something about them that is certainly NOT true. This thing then becomes true!... to an extent. This typically produces some sort of effect based off of the “fact” within reason, and if the target has ever received a specific effect similar to one Cordelia desires to apply to them, this ability rolls with disadvantage. Telling the same lie twice is way less effective, you know. Once per combat."
ability,Cordelia,White Lie,X,,"Quick, come up with something, now! Upon first using this ability, Cordelia lies about something she can totally do! She can’t actually do it under normal circumstances, but her Epithet temporarily makes it so she CAN! This comes in the form of an ability that replaces White Lie for the rest of combat. Remember that this ability should be within reason in relation to her Proficiency in some regard."
weapon,Copeland,A Whip-Gun!,,,"Copeland has to face all types of opposition, so he carries around the most versatile weapon of all, a gun tied to a whip. Copeland can use either of its aspects, and can change his mind on what he’s doing mid-turn if anytimes or other circumstances come up. Whip (5 Damage, 2 Range) - Copeland uses a whip like how a whip is used, except there’s a gun tied to it. Gun (3 Damage, 6 Range) - Copeland uses a gun like how a gun is used, except it’s tied to a whip."
talent,Copeland,The Old Fossil,,,"If Copeland dies due to physical means, he will be instantly fossilized, and through the power of his Epithet, he can come back in a future episode (But he’ll be out of commission for the rest of the current episode). This way, his goal of preventing extinction will never die! There will be intense repercussions for this, however, and he cannot immediately come back as soon as the next episode happens. Additionally, if any part of him is amputated or cut off from him, it will instantly harden into a brittle stone (This also applies to the area around the amputation on Copeland)."
passive,Copeland,Definition of Dinosaur,,,"For the purposes of this kit, “dinosaur” can refer to any creature that was around up until the ice age and is currently extinct."
ability,Copeland,But What If it Was a Dinosaur?,1!,,"Copeland turns something into a dinosaur. It can be anything, really, from parts of a person to an abstract concept (Although, if too powerful, the effect can be nerfed if the GM wishes). These dinosaurs often die immediately because Copeland uses this ability more often than not to destroy stuff, and often because he only transforms the thing into part of a dinosaur. If they’re alive after the initial action, they can still be around not under Copeland’s control. Once per round. (Prof 48) But What If The Dinosaur Lasted Longer? - Dinosaurs created with ‘But What If it Was a Dinosaur’ now get to live on, no matter how much damage or whatever they would take or so! They get 5 stamina, 6 movement, a 4 damage melee bite attack (or potentially a ranged maneuver if they are a weird ranged dinosaur) and an ability based on what it’s made from with a minimum cost of 2, though on rolls of 15+ Copeland gains 6 points to distribute between any of the above stats. It turns back into whatever it was before being a dinosaur upon being knocked out."
ability,Copeland,Dinosaur Bop,3⛯,,"Copeland just takes this turn babbling on and on about how dinosaurs are great and how he’s capable of taking over the world with them or something. As he’s talking, someone on the field (chosen by the player) is taken over by the influence of the dino talk, and one of their abilities becomes altered. The player takes a seen ability of a target of their choosing and replaces up to 6 words of the ability with anything related to dinosaurs or other prehistoric creatures. This will change what the ability does for the rest of the combat, as it’s all dinosaur’d up. Once per combat."
ability,Copeland,And the Dinosaurs are Gone,2+X,,"Copeland hates the forces of nature that killed the great dinosaurs, but he can harness these forces of nature against foes he deems worthy of extinction. Normally, this is a ball of pure extinction that deals 6 damage that can be fired at anyone within 6 range, but it can be augmented with any of the aspects or causes of any major extinction event. However, each extinction event comes with its own set of additional stamina Copeland has to add. There is no cap to how many aspects Copeland can add to this ability. The more stamina pumped into the ability, the more likely success is. Ordovician–Silurian Extinction (2) - Glaciation, Gamma Rays, Volcanism, Metal Poisoning. Late Devonian Extinction (1) - Biolides, Plant Evolution, CO₂ Effects, Magmatism. The Great Dying (3) - Powerful Volcanism, Methane Hydrate Gasification, Anoxia, Supercontinent Pangaea, Celestial Spiral Arm, Microbes. Triassic–Jurassic Extinction (1) - Gradual Processes, Extraterrestrial Impact, Minor Volcanic Eruptions. K-T Extinction (2) - Flood Basalts, Multiple Impact Event, Sea-Level Regression, Baseballs. Holocene Extinction (2) - Climate Change, Habitat Destruction, Overexploitation, Disease. (Prof 43) Help Me With My Extinction Budget - When using the extinction events in And the Dinosaurs are Gone, Copeland can choose to spend 1 extra stamina as many times as he wishes to add extra specific effects from an extinction event he’s already paying for."
ability,Copeland,Excavation Sensation,2,,"Copeland’s Epithet always gives him the urge to dig all the time. Therefore, by using this ability, he just drops down and attempts to dig for more fossils. However, he doesn’t find any fossils, but he does something that can be of use to him! The player names something that’d be interesting for him to find, and if they roll high enough, they get it. If they don’t, they get something else. If the roll is high enough to succeed but the ability is too overpowered for the roll, Copeland will get a nerfed version of the item. (Prof 33) Research Grant - Due to a research grant from [PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY/ORGANIZATION] Copeland now has specialized tools to dig with! This lets him dig out bigger and better stuff using Excavation Sensation much easier, as well as fossils that ordinarily would go to previously unfinished dinosaurs on rolls of 20+."
ability,Copeland,BOLD WORDS FOR A POOR SAP IN THAGOMIZER RANGE,2!,,"Copeland grins and causes a dinosaur’s thagomizer to appear from a person or object within 3 spaces of him or an object on his person. The thagomizer is sized to be proportional to the object and Copeland can make it swing in a 3 space wide cone. This thagomizer can belong to a dinosaur he’s previously logged in his journal, allowing him to apply an effect from them at the cost of 1 extra stamina. Once per round."
ability,Copeland,Now YOU Can Do The Dinosaur!,3⛯,,"The good General Marsh feels the need to grant an ally of his a very special trinket; a Neo-Mesozoic Army medal of honor! He can give this medal to an ally of his to give them a powerful buff and an ability from one of his unsummoned dinosaurs! Additionally, they can turn parts of their body into parts of that dinosaur as parts of actions or attacks and such. Also, they’re promoted to a higher rank in his kingdom’s army, but that’s less important. Once per Person per Combat."
weapon,Ridbi,Life Stopping Sign,,,"6 Damage 1 Range. While this stop sign is great at helping people learn the importance of road safety, it also is great at being a murder weapon! Although, it may be difficult for someone like me to use it effectively if I don’t try hard enough… (Prof 41) Weapon Improvement - Well, like before, I’ve had a couple of ideas for my weapons! I was thinking that this time I could wrap some loose wires around my stop sign to give it +1 damage (5 to 6) and the ability to apply electrical effects!"
weapon,Ridbi,Vitamin Supplement,,,"If you don’t want to be trash like I am, it’s very important to take your vitamins. That way, you can keep improving your health and ascend to grand new heights! To make sure that you get the vitamins, I have dual Gummy Guns that can fire them straight towards you. Of course, if you tried to avoid the shots, that’d be quite despairful for your immune system, so I can fire them while moving! Every time I take a step, I can fire another shot… Isn’t that wonderful? (Prof 29) Weapon Improvement - At this point, I decided that my best option would be to be able shoot allies with harmless, hope-filled gummies that heal them and give them a +1 bonus to rolls for every 2 I hit them with!"
talent,Ridbi,A World Filled with so Many Things,,,"I always say that there’s so much to learn every single day. It’s a phrase that fills me with so much hope for the future of our species! Due to this, whenever I learn the answer to a question that’s been plaguing me for a while, I gain a proficiency point!"
talent,Ridbi,Lark with Emu Heritage,,,"Sure, I’m pretty worthless seeing as how I don’t know how to fly... but at least I can run fast! So fast, in fact, that I get a +1 to my base movement."
talent,Ridbi,Self-Deprecating Mental Firewall,,,"I just happen to be so self-deprecating, I'm numb against any mind-based attacks, giving me 1 DR against them."
talent,Ridbi,Just Like Me!,,,"There are some times when I see someone who reminds me of myself, worthless scum trash who don’t deserve to be within this life! These people can’t be improved in any way shape or form, so I feel so bad for those sorts of people that I just want to give them some way, ANY way to help! So what I do is I, if I’m right next to them, can make them spend their life force and essence for me to use my garbage abilities! That way, they get to help in improving and my ultimate allies get to improve by their effort! Isn’t it wonderful? Of course, I have to be absolutely POSITIVELY certain I can’t help that person, or I’d feel terrible about doing this to them! Me, using the blood of someone so ultimate, what an awful thought, I might die if something like that happens… (Prof 38) Law of Equivalent Improvement - See, I’ve gotten another idea! It’s a sort of worthless one, just like me, but what I was thinking was that instead of sacrificing myself or the other dregs of the earth to help others, I could use the blood of ultimates to improve other ultimates! I can have one of my truly resplendent allies spend the cost for my abilities for me, since I imagine their blood would be much better for it than mine or that of any other trash.[ENVIRONMENT LESSON] Ultimate Allies in Objects - I’ve realized that I have been seeing objects as friends so often, that I have even made two lessons based on that idea! So, I figured, why not make my pathetic camaraderie with nonsentient items useful? Thrice per session, I can completely demolish an adjacent inanimate object that can fit in my hand, and am able to therefore spend an equivalent of up to 5 stamina on any ability for free!"
talent,Ridbi,They’re at their Ultimate Potential!,,,"Seeing my ultimate allies perform their best has reminded me of when I turned people Ultimate to show off the best of their abilities! However, powers and upgrades similar to that seem to pop up all the time and threaten me and my amazing teammates. So, with my memories of being Ultimate fueling me, I plan to even this playing field. My mere presence now allows me and my allies to deal increased damage to opponents with permanent buffs of any kind!"
talent,Ridbi,Critical Curriculum,,,"I’ve realized that there’s some really important tips to give to my allies, such as the idea that weak-points exist on every problem and there’s always a way for hopeful people such as them to spot and identify such things! At the start of combat, I let two of my ultimate allies know about a weak point on the enemies we’re facing and if they try to capitalize on that weakness, a roll of 18 or 19 counts as if they rolled a natural 20! However, this can only happen once per 18 or 19, since the enemies will probably learn from their mistakes and cover up that specific soft spot eventually..."
passive,Ridbi,The Lesson for Today Is...,,,"Every bit of our lives that we go without improvement just makes it so when improvement finally comes, it’s so much greater! Because of that, I’m going to make sure that we all can experience a massive wave of euphoric improvement when the time is right! At the start of combat, I can set something to be learned or improved upon, and oftentimes, the world seems to work towards making that goal come true! If it does come to be, not only are the effects of the goal permanent, but they’re also enhanced greatly. How… wonderful… Isn’t that right?"
passive,Ridbi,A Hopeful Day in the Neighborhood,,,"When I see someone in the past who I’ve improved with my power, I’m filled with absolute joy! This allows me to continue improving them, giving me bonuses to doing so and letting improvements be slightly more effective on them too! These improvements get ever so better over time, but stop when this aspect of my powers has affected someone three times. After the third time, my X cost abilities will be treated as having an extra stamina pumped into it! Additionally, all my negative effects are slightly decreased on thse wonderful people. When I see this person, I also like to have a nice chat to see how much they’ve learned since we last met! I don’t want my students to get lonely or think I don’t care about them anymore, you know?"
passive,Ridbi,undeRling,,,"A small wooden block that has stuck by my side during an epic card battle that determined the fate of the universe has come to life and now aids me in battle! However, it can only aid me in ways that surround the letter permanently marked on its face - the letter R. I, too, can relate to being cursed with power. But undeRling’s capabilities are simply amazing! For you see, their mere presence instantly collects any R’s summoned by my Alphabet’s Gambit. And it also is able to instantaneously zoom up to any written R’s, big or small, and erase them and store them into its special red stat, before zooming back to me right away (Although this is a once per round if it is in the middle of a combat)! This amazing red stat is called its R Stat. As another once per round anytime, undeRling can use any of its points to improve the rolls of its allies by sacrificing any amount of its R Stat! And, as a lucky bonus, any R’s it collects are stored permanently, and are carried in between sessions. undeRling also has infinite movement, and I can choose to see from its point of view if I wish. "
passive,Ridbi,Torchwhack,,,"This special ally is also from a challenge where I picked up a random object and pretended I had yet another friend. This particular torch was with me when I stopped my friend from trapping me and other amazing people inside a stagnant digital purgatory for all time! Now this torch is alive in the form of my wonderful digital partner - Torchwhack! Unlike my other object friend, Torchwhack cannot move any more than two spaces away from me, and only has 6 movement to use at all. However, he does have two basic attacks, that being a 5 damage melee whack or a 3 range 4 damage fire blast! Additionally, he has 15 stamina. For every damage he takes, he gets a proportional amount of Burn Points. Burn Points can be used to add a fire element into whatever I am doing, with the more points spent leading to the more pyre utilized! Torchwhack also passively generates 1 Burn Point at the start of my turn. If Torchwhack falls in battle, I sadly cannot resummon him for the fight, but all of the Burn Points he had at the time will be transferred to me for my use. With this, I can show everyone that they should practice fire safety - or else!"
ability,Ridbi,Alphabet's Gambit,3⛯,,"Sometimes, there’s a certain word we’d love to use in a certain way to explain a certain something, but we’re not quite sure how to spell it! That’s okay, we’ll learn how it’s spelled together so that we can improve our vocabulary. As a once per combat action, I can call upon a swarm of letters that begin flying around the screen. If I, or any of my ultimate allies, manage to touch a letter that forms the word, it will be saved until the whole word is formed. Once it is formed, we can show the rest of the combatants what it means by causing an effect based on it to occur on the battlefield. However, if I, like the failure I often am, allow non-matching letters to collide, they will explode and deal damage to anyone in a 3 space radius of them. Aw man, how are we gonna spell the word if we let that happen? (Prof 32) IMPROVED Alphabet’s Gambit! - After some time thinking about the idea of the word being unable to be spelled when you put the wrong letters together, I did a little improvement of my garbage ability! So, the new thing is that now two sets of letters are flying around at first! When collected now, the word lets out a big initial burst of the effect I want to create before instating a passive effect! You might think, what's the point of the extra letters then? Wellll~ If I go ahead and wait until BOTH sets of letters are fully connected, the effectiveness of the whole thing gets a modifier of 1.5x!!! How do I know that it's specifically 1.5? Well, I can show you the math on my friendly little calculator, it's quite simple to figure out!"
ability,Ridbi,"Roses are Red, Walls are Plaster",1!,,"No matter how scary you might think improvement can be, you’ll never be able to outrun it... And I’ll make sure of it. As an emissary for improvement, I can dash 3 spaces up to 3 times as a once per round anytime action. That way, I can bring improvement to anyone, anywhere! Unfortunately, for each extra dash I use, I have to spend an extra stamina point. It’s disappointing, but a small price to pay for your personal improvement! [STYLISH LESSON] Improving the Ground I Walk Upon! - With my garbage Epithet surging through my body, even the steps I take upon the ground are improved! Whenever I use my dash ability, a letter appears in the second space that I dash across, which gives the first of my amazing allies that steps on it a +1 to all rolls that they make while on my special improved space! However, as soon as this ally steps off, the improved space dissipates, leaving the ground as useless and pathetic as I…"
ability,Ridbi,Stepping Stone for Improvement,X,,"I’m willing to do anything for the sake of improvement, even if it ends up killing me! Whether it’s a short buff, healing, or any other type of effect that would help, I can sacrifice some of my own well-being to ensure that it happens. The more stamina I sacrifice, the more wonderful the result! After all, dying would be a waste if we’re not all at our very best…"
ability,Ridbi,Pin of Brezhnev,1!,,"I always wish the best for those who I choose to improve. It'd be so devastating if an enemy would get in the way of my allies' success! However, thanks to this special pin of former Soviet Union General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, I can prevent that! Once per round, I am able to dash up to half my movement rounded up and defend an ally from an enemy attack, or to attack an enemy that would harm an ally! How amazing, I can now ensure my ultimate allies's victory! [FLASHINESS LESSON] Communist Intervention - Wow! My speed has increased! Rather than moving half my speed to rush to the defense of an ally, I can dash ¾ths of whatever my movement is!"
ability,Ridbi,"Red, Yellow, Green",2!,,"One of the most important lessons in road safety is how to obey traffic lights. But, don’t worry! I’m always willing to give people like you guys, with so much untapped potential, the chance to reach new peaks! As a once per round anytime action, I can pull out my stop sign in order to stop an action dead in its tracks! Conversely, I can change the signs color to yellow or green in order to cause something to slow down or start moving respectively. This way, we can learn the basics of traffic lights together!"
ability,Ridbi,Overachieving Overdrive,X,,"Well you see, I start off by giving an target a bonus to rolls to see how well they can do with some new improvements. It's meant to help them grow as a person and greatly boost them up towards a more ultimate level! This bonus to rolls is equal to how much stamina I spend on this ability, but the finicky thing about this ability is that the improvements might be a little bit too much for them, because, well, after about 2 rounds, the target suffers from a debuff with a debilitating effect proportional to the plus to rolls they had. The debuff usually relates to my current lesson in some way, but could, for example, simply subtract from their rolls. No matter what, though, the debuff usually lasts for an amount of rounds equal to the original roll bonus. I can only spend a maximum of 5 stamina on this ability, so that I don't absolutely overwhelm the one I'm teaching."
ability,Ridbi,Fireworks That Surely Befit the Beginning of the End!,3⛯,,"Wow, this combat sure is getting kind of boring… Well, I’m sure that even someone like me can think of a way to improve it… With bombs! As a once per combat ability, I can make it so approximately 6 bombs, filled with a common school product of my choice, are littered throughout the battlefield, with their whereabouts unknown to everyone including my useless self! Stepping on them causes them to explode and deal 9 damage in a cross pattern, but that’s okay. I’m usually pretty lucky… So I have a funny feeling I won’t end up being blown up this time."
weapon,Moriko,Wooden Bow,,,"3 Damage 6 Range. A bow Moriko can form from any wood, whether it be the stuff on her person or just some wood she finds nearby. While they do come from her Epithet, critical successes from arrows she fires doesn’t get her any proficiency unless she’s specially tricked them out (See Knocked and Loaded)."
weapon,Moriko,Bone Dagger,,,An important survival tool Moriko made for herself as a little girl. Deals 5 damage at 1 range.
talent,Moriko,Sleeps Like a Log,,,"When Moriko sleeps, she actually turns into a log. This makes it basically impossible to spot and ambush her, and she’s immune to most environmental hazards like cold while doing so."
talent,Moriko,Hunter's Opprotunity,,,"If she chooses not to take a move action, Moriko may use both her basic attacks, with the second being at half effectiveness rounding up."
passive,Moriko,Morphic Menagerie,,,"Moriko’s main power comes from taking the natural abilities of Earth’s fauna and incorporating their aspects into herself and her powers. While she does gain automatic knowledge of every species, including those that humans are unaware of at the moment, she does have to have an inherent connection to them in order to truly activate her powers. Moriko can do various types of bonus actions with the aspects of any animals, but that depends on the “tier” a particular species is. Tier 1 - Basically, this is what every animal that isn’t in tier 2 or tier 3 are. Moriko can spend a bonus action to implement minor elements from any animal on top of the form changes she already has, but not much else. Tier 2 - This category is for any animal that Moriko has touched during the course of the session. She will lose access to these samples after the session, but while she has them they are pretty potent. She spends 1 extra stamina on any of her actions to apply a life energy bonus to her non-animal based actions, applying a buff or debuff based on a Tier 2 or higher animal of her choice. She can also transform greater parts of herself into any animal of this tier. Additionally, for this tier and up, Moriko can as a bonus action attempt to command any member of the species that resides within the tiers, which she will have to roll for. However, if she rolls well, the animal will listen to her commands, whether it would want to or not. Tier 3 - This category is reserved only for the species in which Moriko has had a deep bond with. If Moriko makes friends with any animals and has their consent to do so, she can immortalize them through making them a part of her Epithet. She has full unrestricted use of incorporating elements of these animals into herself and her non-animal attacks, and she can more easily utilize these animals in abilities that use Tier 2 or Tier 3 animals. She might have to pay stamina cost if her incorporations are big, and the amount paid will be decided by the GM. She also can choose to summon or unsummon any of these creatures as a free action on her turn. While summoned, she cannot use the animal’s attributes at all, but they do have their own abilities and benefits for Moriko. Moriko can freely telepathically communicate and command any of her Tier 3 animals while summoned, and they are effectively invincible when out, transferring all damage and most effects to Moriko. (Prof 13) Epithet Taxonomy - Moriko is able to use animals created from Epithet summons for Tier 2 and Tier 3 slots, and people with lexical or otherwise animal augmentations for her Tier 2 slots. If the animals created/incorporated into the Epithet user are indiscriminate, then a common variant of the species will be used in the slots."
ability,Moriko,Knocked and Loaded,1,,"Moriko fires a special arrow she’s made before for special purposes. It acts as being fired through her Wooden Bow. Fire Arrow - Deals the weapon’s base damage and ignites the target, causing them to suffer 2 damage a turn unless they stop it somehow. Wired Arrow - Deals the weapon’s base damage, and leaves behind a wire whose other end attaches to the floor tightly, creating a space to walk across. Moriko can instead fire the other end of the wire to another place to further space and control the placing. Moriko moves across the wire with +2 movement, but others may struggle to keep their balance. Rebound Arrow - A special arrow tip, this deals the weapon’s base damage and after impact reflects towards another enemy at the same range as the base weapon. Can only reflect once. Magnetic Arrow - Made with a lodestone arrowhead, this arrow automatically targets the thing with the most magnetic within 1.5x its normal range. It moves extremely fast and precisely, dealing an extra damage and being harder to prevent with anytimes, especially by the target. However, if no target within the given range has anything magnetically attractive on them, this arrow functions just like a normal one. (Prof 24) Bow and Arrow Backlog - If Moriko wants to, she may use Knocked and Loaded as a bonus action instead of a main action to properly set up an arrow without firing it, and have the prepared arrow be used as well as a normal arrow the next time she would make a regular basic attack with her bow. This cannot happen the turn she prepares an extra arrow."
ability,Moriko,Wild Spirit,1,,"Sensing spirits of animals in her surrounding area, Moriko manifests the ghost of an animal that formerly lived in the area and commands it to perform a quick action on a target of her choice. The animal will abide by her command, and it can do anything provided it fits for the animal manifested. The animal can be anything, provided it can be reasoned that it lived and died in the location that it was summoned. Moriko can add aspects or life energy derived from Tier 2 or Tier 3 animals on this ghost."
ability,Moriko,Earthly Enclosures,2,,"Not only can Moriko connect with and draw power from animals, but she can also manifest animal biomes! Targeting an area within 6 spaces of her, Moriko takes an environment that a Tier 2 or Tier 3 animal lives in and morphs that space to resemble it. She can only affect a small amount of spaces if she’s using a Tier 2 animal, but she can create greater effects if she’s using a Tier 3 animal. The changes will remain until the end of combat. (Prof 22) Favored Terrain - While in an area created by Earthly Enclosures, Moriko gains a flat +2 to all rolls. If an animal that naturally belongs there acts in that area, they roll with advantage."
ability,Moriko,Totem Warrior,X!,,"Moriko has learned how to better turn her ability to transform into a log to her benefit. She may now undergo a lapse in consciousness to enter the form of a totem resembling herself and one animal from any tier of her choosing, stacked on top of one another much like a totem. This reduces the damage of an incoming attack by a minimum equal to the tier of the selected animal plus Moriko’s class level, and provides an additional benefit to all targets of Moriko’s choosing within a radius equal to the tier of the selected animal as well. This effect lasts until the beginning of her next turn, during which she cannot move or take any actions, and is only vaguely aware of whatever happens within the radius of her aura as she Sleeps Like A Log. The cost of this ability is equal to the tier of the selected animal. Once per round."
ability,Moriko,Tiers of the Fallen,X,,"Once per Session, Moriko may choose to (temporarily, but for the rest of the session) sever a connection with either a Tier 2 or higher animal, meaning she can no longer use them for any effects. In turn, she may heal her and any allies within a radius of herself equal to the animal’s tier for double that amount of stamina as a bonus action. The cost of this ability is equal to the tier of the selected animal. Bonus Action."
weapon,Vanessa,Solid Shoes,,,"6 Damage 1 Range. Vanessa’s special shoes where most of her Epithet power lies. However, even without her powers, these can still hit hard.(Prof 17) Slide Gang - When using her basic attack, Vanessa can move up to 2 spaces in a straight line. This ignores diagonals."
talent,Vanessa,All-Terrain Sneakers,,,"Vanessa’s shoes are so durable, she can negate all damage and effects from floor hazards. (Prof 15) Gum on Your Shoe - Vanessa’s movement is increased by 2. In addition, Once per Round she can spend 1 Stamina to open the special gum compartment on her shoes while she is moving (whether she initiated it or not) to leave some random gum on the floor in her path which forces the next unit to travel over to become stuck on that space for 1d3 turns and applying an effect based on the gum."
talent,Vanessa,"Hey, Pal",,,"Vanessa can choose to make no sound when she travels on foot. In addition she now rolls advantage on stealth checks, insight checks and perception checks."
passive,Vanessa,Gum Galore,,,"Vanessa’s main source of power comes from the gum that spawns in her overcomplicated shoes. At the start of combat, Vanessa will roll to put 3 pieces of gum in her hands. On her turn, Vanessa can either chew a piece of gum to get its effects, or teleport it to an ally to allow them to use it. When a piece of gum is rolled, a rollable table is activated, and Vanessa’s gum list is used to see which type of gum it is. Whenever Vanessa starts her turn, she automatically gets a new piece of gum. Chewing a piece of gum is a free action. After combat, Vanessa puts the gum away to be used later, or it just disintegrates if an ally is holding it."
ability,Vanessa,Bubble Buster,1,,"Instead of using her gum to boost herself, she instead chews it and blows up a bubble, which uses the gum’s inherent properties in new ways. All bubbles have 6 movement and can only move in one direction per round unless stated otherwise. The bubbles will pop immediately on contact unless stated otherwise. Only 3 bubbles can be out at once. (Prof 10) 6 Second Rule - Once per Gum Bubble, an ally of Vanessa’s (or Vanessa herself) can choose to, if it (or they) moves adjacent, hit the bubble in another direction and give it another 6 movement without bursting it."
ability,Vanessa,Supreme Deduction,1!,,"Vanessa channels her Epithet through her detective skills, sharpening her intelligence for just a moment. She can use this to quickly detect and dodge attacks, pinpoint weak spots to deal extra damage when attacking, or simply use this ability as a higher success perception check. Once per round."
ability,Vanessa,Pumped Up Kicks,3,,"Channeling the technique she killed a man with, Vanessa charges up her shoes with her Epithet and kicks an adjacent opponent, dealing 6 damage to them and sending them flying 5 spaces away. Because the nature of this attack is partially Epithet, very little can stop the target from moving, forcing the target to break through barriers and sending potential allies that try to stop this attack flying with them. (Of course, this can be negated by something super tough or equally as Epithet in nature.) (Prof 19) 1-2-Kick - When using ‘Pumped Up Kicks’, Vanessa can spend 2 Stamina to have “Gum on Your Shoe” connect her to the target, stretch out to its max distance (still with it’s other effects intact) before snapping back to Vanessa at high speeds and allowing her to axe kick them in to the ground when they get adjacent to her again, dealing 1.5x her weapon damage rounding down and forcing them prone. She must roll for this secondary kick, but does so with advantage. This particular instance of the ability is Recharge 4 on a 1d4."
weapon,Fritz,Why are you Hitting Yourself?,,,"The target sees Fritz in front of them, most likely sticking his tongue out, and immediately goes for a swing on him. However, upon making contact, they realize that Fritz scrambled their brain a bit and they actually hit themselves! That little devil! Deals the damage that the enemy’s basic attack normally does with the range that it normally has. (Prof 17) Na-Na Na-Boo-Boo - Why Are You Hitting Yourself? now has 3 range regardless of the weapon being used. (Prof 29) No Holding Back, Okay? - Why Are You Hitting Yourself? now uses the current form of someone’s basic weapon, buffs and all."
talent,Fritz,Wanna Play?,,,"At the start of a session, Fritz picks a toy or board game of some kind he wants to bring with him in case he gets bored."
talent,Fritz,Bag of Tricks,,,"Defying logic, Fritz is able to produce cartoonish sound effects of his choice whenever he feels like it."
passive,Fritz,All Mixed Up!,,,"Fritz is just a lil fucker who takes utter glee in messing up the carefully crafted plans of his enemies and allies. He can also use his power to help those on his team, too, but who knows if he’ll do that. During his turn, Fritz has a set amount of “Swap Actions”, which he can use to switch the placement of any two units who have made physical contact with each other within the past in-universe hour. This also allows him to switch himself with any physical object he’s touched within the past in-universe 30 minutes. Fritz has 3 Swap Actions on his turn, and must pay 1 stamina for each one he uses."
passive,Fritz,It’s All Up in the Air,,,"Using a weird scrambling of the air around him, Fritz is able to float off of the ground avoiding hazards, unstable terrain, or other surfaces/holes he can’t normally walk over. He’s also able to walk on walls and ceilings! "
ability,Fritz,The Good Ol’ Brain Scrambler,X,,"Using the same type of trickery that he utilizes in his basic attack, Fritz scrambles the brain of someone in his sight, making them see an illusion of his choice. While this can be simply used for visual effects, Fritz can also go as far as affecting the target with said illusion. However, if doing this, he must follow these restrictions: There must be something clearly visual about this illusion, to give the target something to focus on. Whatever Fritz is doing, it must be possible to accomplish through Fritz’s current prof as if he could really do it. No matter how immersive it really is, this ability cannot leave tangible effects, even if the target really feels it. For instance, if Fritz creates a gust of chilling air, while the target may feel cold and freeze up a bit, ice will not manifest out of thin air. This also means any damage done though this ability is mental/psychic. No matter how it’s used, knowing full well that it’s an illusion will weaken the effect but not negate it outright. The stamina cost depends on the severity of the ability and how much Fritz is trying to make his target see."
ability,Fritz,Round and Around,2,,"Fritz chooses 2 or more objects on the field and swaps their placement. This can be as simple as swapping two people’s positions or swapping their weapons, to as weird as swapping Fritz’s own arm with a rock to give him a brand new rock-arm basic attack! For each additional object Fritz swaps, he must pay 1 additional Stamina."
ability,Fritz,Tossing Toys,1!,,"Fritz telekinetically grabs an object and throws it in any direction he desires! The path they take does not need to adhere to any sort of physics or gravity in the slightest. If he wants, he can throw multiple objects, but for each additional one he must pay 1 additional Stamina. Once per Round. (Prof 22) Whirligig Brain Scramble - Fritz likes spinning people around as he throws them with Tossing Toys. On rolls 15 or above, units hit by this are afflicted with a Dizzy Status Effect. This makes it so, the next time they intend to use an ability, they must roll 1d3. If they get a 1, they use the ability underneath the one they meant to use instead. If this ability cannot be used in the current context, they still stake stamina cost, but the ability does nothing."
ability,Fritz,Swip-Swap Away!,2,,"This ability does nothing on its own, but can be swapped with another person’s ability. This manifests as this ability and the targeted ability popping out of their respective user’s heads in the form of red and white bubbles, showing all memories of the ability inside, and quickly switching places with each other. If the user has seen an ability be used before, they can specify it as the one they want, or they can roll 1dX (X = number of abilities the character has) to select that number ability."
weapon,Nala,Red Nova,,,"Nala’s totally rad beam sword! Just like Travis Touchdown. Deals 4 electric damage within 2 range, and has the potential to slice through inanimate objects and cause slight burns. She shouldn’t be handling this, to be honest. [LEAH] Grievous Mauling - Due to Leah’s alterations and some later tinkering, Nala now has two swords which each are double-sided, allowing her to have a weaker follow-up to successful basic attacks."
weapon,Nala,Static Shock,,,"As a bonus action taken immediately after taking a full move action Nala can let out a small stream of electricity that was built up by her socks. 3 damage 2 range, must be aimed in the direction she was moving in at the end of her move action."
talent,Nala,Fishy Suspishy,,,Nala can talk to fish.
talent,Nala,Gillty As Electrically Charged,,,"Nala suffers no effects from drowning in freshwater, but can drown in saltwater. In exchange, with saltwater being more conductive, she rolls with a +2 to using her powers while submerged in saltwater."
passive,Nala,Amped Up!,,,"Nala’s real proud of her Epithet, and is willing to push it as far as she can go to effectively utilize it! She can push herself hard … However, she hasn’t really focused on training her Epithet too far after first awakening it. Therefore, if she tries to push herself beyond what she’s frequently capable of doing, she’s gonna be in a world of pain. Not that she’ll stop no matter how often her friends tell her to. Each of her abilities have a “Amped” version, and using an Amped version of an ability is a Once per Combat. Using these Amped abilities will put her in a “Fried” state. Being Fried means that Nala gets a -3 to rolls and a -2 to movement, and can only act via instinct, meaning everyone must make suggestions to the player at the start of Nala’s turn and she acts on the first one the player thinks is good. She also becomes a lot dumber and unresponsive. This lasts for 1d2+1 rounds, and can bleed into after the combat if it resolves before the Fried state goes away (But usually not for long)."
ability,Nala,Thunder Strike,2,,"Nala points dramatically, and a small bolt of lightning bips out from her finger, dealing 5 electric damage to an unobstructed target within her sight (The farther away, the more difficult the roll will be), and knocking them back 2-3 spaces. Amped - The lightning bolt that Nala produces is a bit bigger, dealing 6 electric to a chosen target and 4 damage in the surrounding 3x3 area that knocks everyone in the space 3-4 spaces back. (Prof 4) Stun Grenade - Trace amounts of electricity stay in the target’s muscles causing them to have a -1d2 to their next roll (with the penalty rolled by the target, when they roll). If the Amped version is used all targets instead have a -1d3 for their next turn and to their next anytime."
ability,Nala,Electrosensory,1!,,"Nala’s two long strands of hair perk up, sensing incoming danger. By sensing the electric currents in the air, Nala is able to attempt to dodge out of the way of attacks, reducing or even mitigating the damage she would’ve taken had she gotten hit. Outside of combat, this can be used as an increased perception check (Though it’s specifically for sensing the existence of something through feeling the electric currents in the air). Once per Round. Amped - Nala is able to use half of her movement rounded up to get out of the way, and during this time she’s able to perform small actions like pushing others aside or making small attacks. Nala’s also crackling with electricity, making it so touching her during this brief moment deals around 1 point of electric damage."
ability,Nala,Vitality Volt,1,,"Nala touches something, that being an ally unit or an object of some kind. She then fires in a safe but potent amount of volts into them. If this is done on an ally, this can cure physical ailments (Not anything like burn or poison, but more along the lines of a strained limb or a dazed status effect, stuff that makes sense for electricity to cure). If this is done to an object that needs electricity, it becomes powered up, or it charges to its fullest, whatever is most necessary. It’s a niche but useful aspect to this ability that backfires more often than Nala would want. Amped - Nala touches an adjacent unit, powering them up immensely! For their next turn, they gain them a +2 to their rolls, a general damage boost if applicable, and the option to add electrical properties to their attacks!"
ability,Nala,Wattage Flux,2,,"Move Action. Nala focuses and creates spikes of electricity in varying parts of her body, with less power in others, creating an odd imbalance throughout her system. In doing so, she increases her sensitivity to the electrical signals her epithet allows her to generate and sense, for the next 1d2 rounds she may grant herself advantage on a roll of her choice once per round for 1 stamina (unrolled). This specifically ticks down at the end of her turns starting on the turn after she uses this ability. Amped - When this ability would end, Nala may spend 3 stamina to cause a final surge of electricity throughout herself and any adjacent allies, immediately granting a shared move action, bonus action, and main action to be split however those affected would wish. For the sake of if she grants herself a main action, she may still use her once per round advantage if she has not used it yet."
weapon,Nocturnal,Haywire Haymaker,,,"4 Damage 1 Range. A very hefty punch. This attack can be augmented in its damage, range, and extra effects by Nocturnal’s passive form and any abilities created through his passive. If funneling a created ability through this attack, it may cost variable stamina."
talent,Nocturnal,It’s Just a Phase,,,"Due to his drastic physical augmentations, Nocturnal’s mind constantly shifts between different mental conditions. At the start of the session and at the end of every combat, Nocturnal’s player will message someone in the Discord call, prompting them to give Nocturnal a hyperfixation. Hyperfixations can range from really really wanting a glass of water to believing that birds control the government to being deadly afraid of the color beige. Anything goes, provided that it doesn’t affect his combat capability too much."
passive,Nocturnal,Master of Many Phases,,,"Nocturnal’s body is incredibly unstable on an anatomic level. While it wouldn’t hurt an average person by touching him, it would feel extremely unnerving to do so. However, while it is an unfortunate situation for Nocturnal, this unstable state of his lexical form is the basis of his powers. Nocturnal’s body may be in flux, but there is some basis to it. The main thing being his form always is in sync with the phase of the moon. This moon phase will be determined by the actual moon phase of the day in real life, unless the GM mentions a specific one in-universe. This moon phase will determine the power/quantity of Nocturnal’s moonlight or darkness. This will determine the elemental damage type for each of Nocturnal’s abilities, if applicable. The Moon phase damage types are as follows: New Moon - Powerful Darkness. Waning Crescent - Weakened Moonlight, Strong Darkness. Waning Gibbous - Strong Moonlight, Weakened Darkness. Half Moon - Base Powered. Moonlight, Base Powered Darkness. Waxing Gibbous - Strong Moonlight, Weakened Darkness. Waxing Crescent - Weakened Moonlight, Strong Darkness. Full Moon - Powerful Moonlight. Additionally, Nocturnal can utilize his fluctuating anatomy to replace any current abilities he has with brand new ones. However, there are a few restrictions to this. Switching out abilities is a free action on Nocturnal’s turn, but can only happen once per turn. The ability must have the exact same usage as the ability it replaces (Anytimes replaced with anytimes, Once Per Combats replaced with Once Per Combats, etc.) Additionally, it has to be the same cost as the original ability. The ability must always be based on moonlight and/or lunar darkness in some capacity, but can draw secondary properties from other definitions of phases. The ability must also be compatible/consistent with Nocturnal’s current phase (Although it can be used outside of it). (Prof 4) In Focus - Nocturnal’s constantly fluctuating nature means that his powers are often also inconsistent. When replacing an ability with Master of Many Phases, if said ability has Proficiency Upgrades, the newly created ability is able to take the Upgrade Slot(s) of the previous (which Soleil will write unless Kakapo wants to). Along with this, at any point, Nocturnal can choose to “re-spec” his upgrades, reallocating any Upgrade Slots on his abilities to any other ability. To do this, Nocturnal must pay 1-5 Max Stamina, dependent on how many upgrades the ability already has and/or the potency of the upgrades. Similarly, re-specing mid-combat often costs slightly more Max Stamina. Constant Instability - While Nocturnal has learned to maintain his erratic form, others who attempt to copy the core of his passive is not so lucky. If Master of Many Phases is copied, the copier will experience a constant, shifting pain within their very molecular structure, dealing 1 damage to them every round they are in combat until they rid themselves of it. If someone attempts to copy it via recreation due to their own capabilities, they will have to put more resources into it in order to figure out how to not hurt themselves to achieve this power. This passive also ensures the complete inability to completely or partially remove Master of Many Phases, but the suppression of it is still possible. Likewise, this passive is entirely unchangeable and unremovable."
ability,Nocturnal,Moonlight Mirage,1!,,"Casting over their cloak and darkening/brightening the area around themselves, Nocturnal temporarily completely turns to moonlight/darkness, allowing any attack coming their way to phase through them. Once per Round."
ability,Nocturnal,Lunar Bullet,1,,"Nocturnal makes a finger gun motion with one of his hands, and shoots a bullet comprised of moonlight/darkness at a target within 6 spaces. This normally deals around 5 damage. However, if Nocturnal comprises the bullet out of light, it will explode upon impact, knocking the target back 3 spaces at base. If the bullet is comprised of darkness, the impact of the bullet locks the target’s shadow in place temporarily, slowing them down. They will have to spend half their movement to break free at base. (Prof 7) Tommy Gun Under The Moonlight of a Cold Winter Night in the Middle of December - Lunar Bullet can now be fired up to 3 times in a single action! For each additional bullet fired, Nocturnal must pay an additional 1 Stamina. If the same unit is hit multiple times in one bullet volley, the damage dealt is scaled decently heavily. When these bullets fire, Nocturnal can choose for all of them to hit at once and apply their effects afterwards, or for them to apply one after the other."
ability,Nocturnal,History Repeats Itself,3,,"Casting a 3x3 area of moonlight/darkness around themselves, Nocturnal leaves behind a light construct duplicate as they take the rest of their move action to leave (Must have a minimum of 3 movement to use). The Nocturnal clone inside can then maneuver themselves however they wish, although they are restricted to only using the last non-History Repeats Itself ability that Nocturnal used, alongside only being able to affect or move within the 3x3 area they were made inside. 2-3 of these areas can exist at once, and any area can be dispelled on Nocturnal’s turn."
weapon,Alex,Slingy Dingy,,,"Alex is a bit of a technological wiz, being one of those people, he’s designed a slingshot that is perfectly crafted and tutored to his means. Using this slingshot, she’s able to fire explosive pellets at a target to deal 3 explosion damage at 5 range. Alex can also delay the explosion for up to 4 turns. For each turn she delays it, the damage increases by 1. However, if they do so, the pellets can be removed relatively easily. She will have to roll again to have the pellets explode on the turn, but she rolls with a +1.5*X (rounding up) modifier, X being the number of turns that has passed since the initial placing. If Alex were to attempt to explode the pellets prematurely they would only deal base damage and Alex rolls at X/2 (rounding up) disadvantage."
talent,Alex,Teamwork Makes the Dreamwork,,,"Alex kinda just likes bein’ around people, he’s kinda like that. When rolling on not Alex’s turn, Alex has a +3 to rolls. While rolling on his turn he has a +1 while adjacent to at least 1 ally (his summons also have this talent.)"
passive,Alex,Action Economy More Like Action Eshonomy Ayyyyyyyyyyyyy Up Top I Like Helping People,,,"Due to Edare being a one of a kind piece of technology, if this passive were to be copied or replicated or transfered in any fashion, Red Stat can only be generated if the user rolls a natural 20 on a Red Stat generating action, generating 1, and all the Red Stat costs are doubled. Red Stat generation of the copied/mimic/replicated/transferred passive cannot be modified in any way. Original Talent: Whenever Alex would successfully roll, and the roll in question has something to do with an ally whether it be helping them with an anytime, dual teching, giving them a buff, or anything that could be remotely connected to interacting with an ally, they gain a red stat called Red Stat, which is kept within Edare. Red Stat generation cannot be altered in any way by outside influence and one is always given regardless of how helpful the action is, or if Alex himself would roll a 20. If multiple allies are helped at once, Alex can gain a maximum of 3 Red Stat from the action in question. Alex can spend Red Stat to have Edare give her adrenaline shots, basically giving herself more action economy for any her abilities. The actual exchange rate is as follows: 4 Red Stat - Ability now costs a movement action. 6 Red Stat - Ability is now a Bonus action. 10 Red Stat - Ability is now a once per Alex’s turn Free action. 15 Red Stat - Ability is now a once per round anytime action. Once Red Stat is exchanged for a certain modification, said modification is locked in. Alex is able to jump the adjustment to its next level if they pay the difference between the two levels +2. These modifications persist between combats during a session and all alterations reset after 2 data bounties. To exchange Red Stat is a free action on Alex’s turn."
ability,Alex,Tactical Shmovement and a Little Somethin’ More,1,,Alex dashes 8 spaces in a cardinal direction with some kind of net in their hands. If Alex passes by an attack or ability being used at the same time they are moving they are able to store a small portion of the ability and apply an effect based on the ability to their explosives. (This ability can immediately jump to the anytime modification at a third of the cost of the Red Stat.)
ability,Alex,The Little Ones,2,,"Alex rolls out 1d4! (Maximum 6) small spherical bombs that are wirelessly connected to a detonator in Alex’s hand. These bombs have 6 ‘movement’ and roll in a straight line away from Alex on each of their turns. They can move and bounce off of terrain that would theoretically be in the way. They stop moving when Alex wants them to stop or they have moved a total of 18 spaces. Alex, as a X per round anytime action, (X being the number of bombs in play divided by 2) can explode these bombs in a 2x2 area dealing 3 damage to all who would be inside. Allies, as a free action, can pick up these bombs and incorporate them into an attack somehow. If this is done, the attack’s damage is increased by 2, or the action gets a +3 to the roll for each bomb the ally incorporates into the attack."
weapon,Miffle,Practice Punch,,,"8 Damage 1 Range. An extremely simple technique, something to either allow Miffle to do something while he strategizes or when he’s just warming up. It’s still pretty strong though."
talent,Miffle,Physically Well Built,,,Miffle has the movement of a svelte and the death range and strength of a heavyset.
ability,Miffle,Ostrich Drill,3,,"Much like the myth of an ostrich burying its hand into the sand to hide, Miffle slams his head into the ground, causing a massive burst of force to exit his head and create an 8 space crack in the ground. This crack is easy to fall into, with anyone who steps over it taking 5 damage and falling in, needing to use a move action or make a save to climb out. These cracks do not go away unless something is used to remove them."
ability,Miffle,Impenetrable Shield,2!,,"Miffle constructs a wall made out of pure force and ki, blocking most attacks from passing through it. This wall can be up to 5 spaces long, but can only be 1 space wide. If Miffle desires, at the start of his next turn after the creation of this ability, he can choose to keep the wall up and even move it with him should he ever move adjacent to a wall, but he must pay the ability’s cost in upkeep at the start of every one of these turns. Miffle can only have one barrier up at a time. Once per Round."
ability,Miffle,Luminous Lariat,3,,"Miffle swings his arm at an opponent, with his arm glowing a bright white because of the immense ki power coming off of it. This has a pool of 10 points, which can be specced into either knockback or damage depending on what Miffle desires, with a minimum of 1 needing to be attributed to either. "
weapon,Nobunaga,Kimidori (気緑),,,"5 Damage, 2 Range. A yellow and green sword. While it is a tad dull, it is hefty. This attack can be used in conjunction with Aoaka on one target with damage penalties, or two different targets at once if applicable."
weapon,Nobunaga,Aoaka (青赤),,,"A blue and yellow blade. It’s rather thin, cutting through the air like a knife through butter, and while it deals less damage than Kimidori, it’s able to reach farther, not even having to make contact as the air itself pushed by the blade can deal damage on its own. This attack can be used in conjunction with Kimidori on one target with damage penalties, or two different targets at once if applicable."
talent,Nobunaga,Sicky Sword Trickies,,,"Nobunaga’s sword’s are in good hands, as he has trained with them for a long time and is an expert in his craft. The two sword basic attacks have broadened potential, and can be used in far more creative ways, but more complicated techniques will require 1-3 stamina to be paid."
talent,Nobunaga,Cursed Body,,,"Due to the incredibly cursed nature of the Bakekujira, curses inflicted on Nobunaga can be turned on their head, benefiting him rather than cursing him."
passive,Nobunaga,Way of the Samurai,,,"When Nobunaga is in the presence of another samurai, his residual cursed energy flares even farther to life, turning into a beneficial energy that resides within Nobunaga and anyone who shares his profession. All samurai gain a DC-2 to their rolls (Making the lowest success a 4, though it will be a minor success), and can flavor their attacks to be more impactful, potentially even spending some stamina to add extra flair to their attacks (No more than 2)."
ability,Nobunaga,Vengeance Cut,2,,"Unsheathing a single blade, Nobunaga makes a large cut within a 5x[Weapon Range] area, with the longer side being adjacent and centered on Nobunaga. This deals 1.5x the weapon damage, 2 if the target has recently attacked any of Nobunaga’s allies, whether it hurt them or not.  "
ability,Nobunaga,Axis Pierce,1,,"Nobunaga marks to spots, opposite to each other, and tosses his swords out at them. This is essentially a line attack that centers on Nobunaga that goes out infinitely in any direction. Each weapon will be allocated to one side, except it deals +1 extra damage with no additional effects. After sailing into the distance, the two swords fly back into Nobunaga’s hands, making it so dodge rolls will have to be rolled twice, although the second one will be far easier."
ability,Nobunaga,Filter Feeding,2,,"Bonus Action. Nobunaga’s spirit power grows greater in his swords, as he slashes a target in an X pattern. This does no damage, but much like a whale feeding on krill, this filters out a special property of a target and applies it to one of his swords. Only one special property can be applied at a time per sword, but Nobunaga has control over which sword gets what."
ability,Nobunaga,The Sliceclone,3,,"Nobunaga suddenly twirls around, dealing double of both of his sword’s damage to all targets within a 5x5 area centered around themselves. This is rolled for twice, one for each sword, and this counts as two attacks within one ability."
weapon,Baron Dicktardly,Firing Blank,,,"2 Damage, ∞ Range. Baron Dicktardly pulls out a gun, aims it at a target and fires it, but it doesn’t actually shoot anything. However, with Baron Dicktardly’s Epithet influencing his immense trickery powers, this shot is incredibly convincing no matter how many times it’s fired, and the damage is dealt via the target flinching a little too hard. This makes it harder for the target to react to things until the end of the turn. Criminals Aren’t Killers - Despite Baron Dicktardly’s Epithet assisting him in so much evil, it also took to his own definition of evil, which is quite different from most at the time. He considers evil to be crimes of pure and utter inconvenience, like a grand-scale train heist that takes people’s money and wastes their time if they needed to go somewhere on the train that is now derailed - nothing icky like killing or hurting someone badly. Therefore, Baron Dicktardly’s Epithet makes it physically impossible for him or any of his subordinates to kill or harm anyone else via their actions, even if it’s indirect or by accident. This takes the form of a black energy shielding a person if they would have been hurt or killed from Baron Dicktardly’s actions, preventing any harm from being done. If any of Baron Dicktardly’s kit components are copied, this passive is also copied and is attached to the item that is copied, but only applies to things from Baron Dicktardly’s kit."
weapon,Baron Dicktardly,THE DICKTARDLY DICK KICK,,,"Baron Dicktardly’s most devastating technique. If the target has a dick, this ability rolls advantage, will deal 2.5x the original damage, and knocks the target prone.

talent,Baron Dicktardly,Baron Only in Name,,,"Baron Dicktardly isn’t an actual baron - he has no aristocratic power nor is he British. However, he took on the title to commit both the crimes of tax evasion and royalty impersonation. This works so well that it’s pretty hard to track him down to make him pay his taxes! That fiend! This talent will be extremely helpful for him when the IRS is established within the next year. "
passive,Baron Dicktardly,Declaration of EVILDOINGS,,,"Baron Dicktardly’s Epithet desires deeds of pure evil to be done, and when the Baron’s mind is set on something rather mischievous, his Epithet will allow him to do it in its fullest. During his turns, along with his regular action economy, Baron Dicktardly has a DEVIOUS ACTION, which allows him to declare one nebulous petty bad thing he will do during the turn. Once this thing has been declared, his Epithet will manifest and allow him to do things he normally couldn’t for the sake of doing that one thing as quickly as possible. For instance it could manifest as a bunch of energy hands to grab things that he cannot reach quick enough, or as simple tools for him to utilize while doing this evil. This must be actively malicious and petty in order to work.

weapon,Onca,Jaguar Style,,,"X Damage 1 Range. Onca’s well versed in martial arts, and he’s able to utilize the skills he knows in tandem with his powers. This attack could theoretically be anything, with variable amounts of damage depending on the specific attack and roll. When using this attack, Onca can incorporate a variable amount of stamina into this attack to filter a specific ability to further boost this attack’s capabilities."

passive,Onca,Overwhelming Drought,,,"Onca’s holding back, sure, but the sheer heat and strength of his power can be felt all throughout of the arena where he is fighting. Every damage dealt is counted as partial fire damage, and the power and heat exuding from Onca causes people adjacent to him to roll with a -2."
passive,Onca,Unstoppable Force,,,"Onca’s strength is unmatched, but he knows how to hold his punches. When he does this, however, he finds that he has a greater chance of pushing people where he wants. Onca can subtract from his damage and roll to add variable amounts of knockback to his attacks. Both will be converted at a 2:1 ratio. Likewise, knockback dealt to him is greatly reduced, if not outright negated."
passive,Onca,Holding Back,,,"Despite his sheer overwhelming power, Onca constantly feels responsible to restrain himself as to not get his foes too beaten up. And even if he isn’t showing all of his cards now, you can never be too safe. All failures will be treated as him deciding to restrain himself, as otherwise his opponents would just get obliterated. Additionally, kit aspects can be outright ignored if he feels it would be unfair to utilize them."
ability,Onca,Flame Body,1!,,"With a flick of his wrist, Onca turns himself into a yellow solar fire which allows him to negate the damage of any attack coming his way, as it just passes through him.

ability,Onca,Five Suns,5,,"By using as much power as he is willing to in this scenario, Onca raises both of his arms in the sky and creates a sun. This sun is bigger than the sun seen in The Tale of Icarus, and seemingly a lot more powerful. Onca chucks this sun into something within his sights, and upon crashing into something, it deals around 20 damage to whoever it hits, and in general leaves behind a lot of collateral damage. Onca has five suns he can utilize, each of which can only be used once per combat. Upon each use, the stamina cost for this ability goes up by 2. Onca can also opt to use multiple suns, but each sun utilized adds another 2 to the total cost. Mixing suns together, especially if their elements would naturally interact in a certain way, and if they’re being launched into a certain place, can produce an even bigger, more devastating effect. First Sun - A sun seemingly bursting with life. Upon landing, 5 clones of Onca with 5 stamina each appear within 3 spaces of the epicenter of the impact. These clones only have access to Onca’s basic attacks. Second Sun - A sun with plenty of blustering activity around it. Upon landing, a concussive wind blast knocks everyone within 6 spaces of the sun 4 spaces away and into the air, dealing 5 damage to them upon landing. Unstoppable Force cannot be applied to this ability if this sun is in use. Third Sun - A sun that feels exceptionally hotter than a normal sun. Upon landing, a massive heatwave rushes out from it, dealing 10 damage to anyone within 2 spaces of it, and 5 damage to anyone within 5 spaces away from it. A burn status will also be applied to everyone damaged by this, which deals 1d4 fire damage on the start of their turns until something is done about it. Fourth Sun - A sun with a weirdly cool energy to it. Upon landing, a 5x5 pool of water with a raging whirlpool in the middle manifests, and anyone caught inside is dragged to the center, and have quartered movement when trying to get out. This pool also dampens fire damage. Fifth Sun - A sun brimming with an extremely violent energy. Upon landing, a wave of bloodthirsty energy is released, and everyone in the battlefield is injured to satisfy this. Specifically, one limb from everyone, decided by Onca, will have a massive gash cut into it, and usage of that part in the future will be hampered. The farther away from the impact, the smaller the cut and the subsequent suppressing of the limb usage will be."

These cameras have access to Bright Flash! and *Snap* (At a weaker potential, of course, and only 3 cameras being able to use 1 Once Per Round per round), and have 6 movement and 10 health. The Mad Camera’s control over the cameras takes priority above all other forms of control. Cameras controlled rather than created are more effective at what they do, and new abilities can be stemmed off of them, on top of them having 5 extra stamina. The more cameras on the field, the less can be created at a time."
ability,Mad Camera,*Snap* That’s Going in my Cringe Compilation,2!,,"Whipping its head to a particularly interesting or utterly cringe moment, the Mad Camera takes a picture of the target that performed the moment or the closest opponent to them.

After recharging for a round after taking such a powerful picture, the Mad Camera prints it out, and from then on out, as a bonus action, it can apply damage and effects by doing various things to the picture. The damage and effects will be unavoidable, unless the picture can be obtained via stealing it before said damage and effects are applied. The picture will also start printing beneath its head a bit, so it can be stolen before the Mad Camera can use it. This ability cannot be used while a picture is being printed."
weapon,Misty,Ravenous Hunger,,,"You can’t spell slaughter without *LUNCH TIME!*  Misty tries to take a big fucking bite out of whatever happens to be in front of her.

passive,Misty,Cry Havoc,,,"Both of Misty’s arms are enormous undulating maws that devour anything that moves and most things that don’t.  Aren’t they just adorable~?  Each of her arms is a separate entity called a ‘Hound’ with 5 Stamina each, and while they’re active, her attacks and abilities have additional effects.  The hounds move with her and are always adjacent to her on opposite sides.  An ally can occupy the same space as a hound, but an enemy can’t.  Whenever Misty takes damage, if either of her hounds are still active, she can negate half of the damage she took and transfer it to one (not both) of the arms instead.  She and the hound must always take a minimum of 1 damage when she does this.  When one of the hounds runs out of Stamina, it melts into a pile of rust-colored slag that smells like blood.  On her turn, she can attempt to regenerate a hound by using her movement action and making a roll.  If she rolls a 10 or higher, the hound is regenerated.  If she fails this roll, she can spend her movement again on a later turn and regenerate one automatically.  Both the hounds are regenerated automatically at the end of combat. [15] Long Bois - Misty’s hounds can now be moved anywhere within her basic attack range during her turn, meaning they no longer have to stay adjacent to her and on opposite sides. It is also no longer possible to destroy a hound in one hit - if a hound is at full Stamina and takes lethal damage, it is set to 1 Stamina. [56] A Monster... Who Protects Her Friends, Goddammit! - If one of Misty’s hounds is within 3 spaces of one of Misty’s allies, when that ally is attacked she can have the hound take the brunt of the hit. If she rolls higher than the attack does, then the hound takes the attack’s damage unless the hound is destroyed with damage still left over, in which case that damage carries over to the ally. In this specific instance, her hounds can still be destroyed from full health. If she uses this on someone she has 5 or more Companionship with, she rolls with advantage. Once per round and once per hound. [60] And Let Slip The Dogs Of War - When Misty takes damage, she can now split the damage between herself and both of her hounds instead of just one, though the minimum damage all three of them can take is still 1. [73] You Can Heal The Dog In Destruction Bench Agreement - In addition to transferring damage between her hounds, Misty can now transfer healing between them as well.  This healing, unlike damage, does not have to be divided evenly and can be distributed however she wishes.  In addition, if Misty has no hounds remaining, she gains 1.5x healing from all sources (rounded down). [87] Strength Of Many - Once per round, when Misty pays Stamina cost for one of her abilities, she can choose to have one of her hounds pay the cost instead, though the cost is increased by 3 for them if they do this.  If a hound dies through Stamina cost, then it can die in one hit; however, it does not die until the end of the current turn."
passive,Misty,No-Eyed Girl,,,"Misty is utterly blind, and automatically fails any perception checks that would require sight.  However, her sense of smell is extraordinarily good, and perception checks she makes that use it have a +4 bonus."
passive,Misty,Bloodlust Is A Coping Mechanism,,,"When Misty deals damage to an enemy while one or both of her hounds are missing, she can roll 1d4. On a 3, one of her hounds is regenerated. On a 4, both of her hounds are regenerated and she heals for 3 Stamina."
passive,Misty,The Munch Bunch Special,,,"Misty can now use her movement or main action on her turn to attempt to eat something within her basic attack range and heal a small amount of Stamina from it. On low rolls, she will heal for very little or not at all. The larger and more delicious the object, the more it will heal for. Misty likes organic and fleshy things the most."
passive,Misty,Dogged Determination,,,Misty’s movement speed can no longer be reduced unless she is completely paralyzed or restrained.
passive,Misty,Living Weapon,,,"At the start of her turn, while both of her hounds are active, Misty can use a bonus action to fall into a cold, focused fury. Rather than a hunger-fueled rampage, Misty focuses all of her energy into defeating her enemies as quickly as possible, by any means necessary. To activate this, Misty does not have to roll but she and both of her hounds must each spend 3 Stamina. While in this fury stance, Misty loses the ability to transfer damage to her hounds, cannot regenerate them by dealing damage, and cannot activate Forbidden Protocol as an anytime action. All damage she or her hounds take is increased by 1. At the start of each of her turns, she or her hounds must pay 4 Stamina between all of them to remain in this stance. While experiencing this cold fury, every damage number on Misty’s sheet (except the one in Blood Puppies) is increased by 2, and Misty’s movement speed increases by 2. Her basic attack has a +2 to its roll. ‘Forbidden Protocol’ now has a new effect entirely: when used successfully, Misty can then attempt 3 basic attacks on three different targets within range. They MUST be different targets. While in this stance, Misty can move, use an action, and move again during her turn and can take 2 main actions that must be different from each other. Misty can exit this stance only at the very start of her turn, but it’s a free action to do so."
passive,Misty,Unstoppable Force,,,"All purely physical non-DoT damage Misty takes is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.  This cannot be pierced by any effect that would go through DR.  This does not apply to her hounds or leeches."
ability,Misty,Blood Puppies,2,,"Misty’s hounds undulate for a moment before puking up smaller versions of themselves that writhe on the ground like tiny, ravenous maggots.  For each of her hounds that are currently active, she can spit up four worms, meaning she can spit up a maximum of eight.  If neither of her hounds are active, she can vomit them up herself, but she only gets two.  The worms each have 1 Stamina and 5 movement.  They can’t deal damage on their own, but if they do make a successful attack on a target, they latch on to them, and the enemy gets a stacking debuff according to how many worms are attached to them.  At the beginning of each of the target’s turns, they take 1 damage for every 2 worms attached to them.  When multiple worms make an attack against a target, they roll as one entity and get a +1 bonus to the attack for every two worms attacking.  If 6 worms or more do damage to a target at once, Misty heals 1 Stamina.  The worms can stay latched on to a target forever, but various methods can be employed to remove them. [29] Writhing Multitudes - Unless she critically fails, ‘Blood Puppies’ will now always give Misty at least 4 worms, even if she rolls badly or both of her hounds are inactive. Once per combat, ‘Blood Puppies’ can be used as a bonus action. [67] Tear You Apart From The Inside Out - If Misty and both of her hounds are directly adjacent to a target and uses ‘Blood Puppies’, then the puppies do not have to make a separate attack on the target to latch on to them - they are injected directly into their bloodstream. They are much harder to remove when used in this way - they can still be torn out with force alone, but doing this will likely deal minor damage."
ability,Misty,Forbidden Protocol,4!,,"Smiling devilishly, Misty forcibly de-compresses the limitation devices attached to her back, releasing the all-consuming darkness locked within her body.  Dozens of smaller hounds erupt from her back, teeth gnashing and hungry for flesh.  Her main hounds are regenerated immediately if either were missing.  While in this mode, Misty can make counter-rolls against any target attacking her that’s in range of her basic attack. If she rolls higher than the opponent, they take her basic attack damage and their action is reduced in effectiveness.  When Misty deals damage with her basic weapon in this mode, the damage is increased by 2 and she heals for 1 Stamina.  This mode lasts until the end of her next turn, and she must wait one round after it deactivates before she can use it again.  Each use costs 2 more Stamina than the previous use. At the end of combat, the cost returns to normal. [40] Crunch Time: Forbidden Protocol’s cost now no longer goes up"
ability,Misty,Devour,3⛯,,"Once per combat, Misty can just swallow someone whole.  The target must be in her basic attack range and cannot be larger than a 2x2 icon.  The target is utterly consumed and trapped inside Misty’s stomach, unable to use attacks or abilities unless they target themselves or Misty.  On each of Misty’s subsequent turns, she can use an action or movement action to start digesting the target, dealing 4 damage to them.  The target can attempt to escape in whatever manner they see fit, and it’s possible to crawl out of one of Misty’s mouths again with persistent effort.  If they do a substantial enough amount of damage to Misty from the inside, she has to roll to resist or vomit them up immediately.  Attacks and abilities against Misty have a large bonus to succeed while the target is inside her. [34] Wash Down The Anime Girl - Using ‘Devour’, Misty can now swallow targets up to the size of a 4x4 icon, and if she swallows a target that’s 2x2 spaces or larger, she heals for 2 Stamina when she digests them."
ability,Misty,Feral Rampage,2!,,"All of a sudden, Misty just starts RUNNING towards her prey, growling like a rabid dog. Misty chooses a target and charges towards them in a straight line. The target can be any distance away as long as it’s a straight shot to get to them, though the roll will be more difficult for extreme distances. Anyone or anything in her way takes 2 damage and is knocked aside, and she then pounces on the target themselves, knocking them to the ground. The target takes 3 damage and has their movement halved on their next turn. This ability cannot be used to dodge attacks, but it can disrupt them if the target is the source of them. If Misty immediately uses an attack or ability on the pounced target, it has a +2 bonus to its roll. Once per round. [43] Death Hurricane - ‘Feral Rampage’ now knocks targets back that are in a 3 space wide line between Misty and her primary target and it’s no longer more difficult to reach a target that’s very far away."
ability,Misty,Thrill of the Hunt,1,,"*Nothing* can stop Misty once she’s gotten a taste of someone.  Misty relentlessly hunts down someone who she has previously damaged during this combat and makes a basic attack against them.  This ability allows her to enhance the attack in some manner that is typically physically impossible.  Examples include running up a flat wall, crashing through a tough barrier, or leaping dozens of feet into the air.  It can also be as simple as partially breaking through some kind of shield or DR the target has. [36] Who Let The Dogs Out? - Misty has breached containment to kick your ass. Misty can now spend 3 Stamina on ‘Thrill Of The Hunt’ instead of 1 to give the roll advantage."
ability,Misty,Blood Titan,3!,,"In a rare moment of focus, Misty manages to manipulate her own infinite bloodlust, transforming it into a terrifying force. Channeling her epithet, an enormous geyser of blood and viscera blasts outwards from one of her hounds, and Misty has nuanced control over it. She can use this bloodbending to do several things within a range of 5 spaces from the hound. Its most basic function is to simply blast a target to damage them (usually 4-6 damage) or disrupt their actions; however, she can also manipulate the blood in more creative ways, such as hardening it into tentacles that can restrain or pull targets, or turning it into armor that protects Misty or an ally. Whichever hound she uses this ability from must pay 3 Stamina to do so. If she does not have hounds currently active, she can use this ability with her own mouth, but it only has a 3 space range and somewhat lessened effectiveness. The blood geyser still happens even if the hound it’s coming from dies. Once per two rounds."
ability,Misty,Beasts of Baskerville,3!,,"This ability can only be activated as an anytime at the moment when one of Misty’s hounds has regenerated, otherwise it is used as a main action on her turn. Misty manipulates the goo-like flesh of her hounds to take on a new shape of her choice; both of her hounds if used as a main action, only the one that just regenerated if used as an anytime. The shape can be anything she wants, from some kind of animal to a giant hammer or sharpened blade. The hounds will have the expected properties of whatever she transforms it into; from dealing more damage, having innate passive effects, performing specific actions, or possessing more Stamina than usual. The maximum Stamina a hound can possess with this ability is 10, and the exact amount is up to the GM. If a hound takes a specific action other than just attacking, it will cost both the hound AND Misty 1-5 Stamina like an ability would. One such action can be used as a bonus action on Misty’s turn, but using a second one will take her main action. In addition, once per combat, she can also apply minor properties to her hound(s) based on a character or ability she has seen during this session/data bounty. Once per round."
weapon,Lizzie,Gang Gang,,,"4 Damage, 2 Range. Gang gang. Lizzie raises her lab coat to reveal a pack of normal lizards ready to strike the nearest enemy."
weapon,Lizzie,Special Lizard Toss,,,"As a bonus action, or as part of Lizzie’s Gang Gang Basic Attack, Lizzie can throw up to 4 Special Lizards onto a unit of her choice. The range of the throw is equal to the movement of each Special Lizard she throws. They deal no damage initially, but if a unit has any Special Lizards attached to them at the start of their turn, they take 1dX (X = the total amount of damage each lizard would deal combined) of damage. Units can attempt to remove Special Lizards by making a check at the start of their turn or by directly attacking them. If they succeed the above check, all Special Lizards harmlessly fall onto adjacent spaces."
talent,Lizzie,Long Life of the Lizard,,,"Some lizards are able to break off their tails to escape from an enemy’s grasp! Similarly, Lizzie is able to break off one of her OWN body parts to avoid taking damage from something! It can only be used once per session, and the body part will regenerate over time!"
talent,Lizzie,"Listen, Lizards!!",,,"If Lizzie pays 2 stamina as a bonus action on her turn, she can redirect the attention of all lizards and Special Lizards she has summoned currently on the battlefield to a new target/task, causing them to change their mission immediately and go wild! Depending on the severity of the desired task, the effectiveness of this may vary in terms of what it does immediately upon activation."

passive,Lizzie,Lizard Colony,,,"After EXTENSIVE research, Lizzie has finally finished crafting her greatest machine yet: The Artificial Den! This 2x2 drone contains a sub-spatial area only accessible by pureblood lizards, creating an infinitely large home for them to thrive in. Since creating this device, Lizzie has begun trying to cultivate special species of lizards, with the Den acting as their homebase. As of current, these “Special Lizards” are comprised of three different types, of which she starts with 3 of each at base: Spicy Boys: Feisty, red lizards with brilliant, orange eyes and sharp snouts. These lizards have general fire element imbued within them, and are physically the strongest of all the lizard types. Along with their relatively powerful 2 damage per lizard, this grants them 4 stamina each. They also have 3 movement when separated from Lizzie. Shocking Bananas: Slim, yellow lizards that arc electricity between their horns. These lizards, obviously, have general electric element imbued within them, and are the fastest of all the base lizard types. They have 5 movement when seperated from Lizzie, and deal 1 damage per lizard. Along with this, they have 3 stamina each, are incredibly aerodynamic, and their electricity can pass through DR. Hydrated Lads: Wavy, blue lizards with gills, allowing them to breathe underwater and swim through the air! These lizards have general water element imbued within them, and can create bubble pockets that allow them to ignore difficult terrain and other environmental effects. They have 3 movement when seperated from Lizzie, 3 stamina each, and deal 1 damage per lizard. At the start of combat, The Artificial Den is placed adjacent to Lizzie, and she can call out up to 4 Special Lizards of any type. As a movement action while adjacent to the Den, she can call out up to 4 more at any point in combat. When Lizzie moves, lizards produced from the Den travel with her (assuming she has not given them other tasks). Whenever a Special Lizards(s) is adjacent to or is attached to a unit that is knocked out, whichever Special Lizard Type has majority presence has the amount of damage that unit took within the last round stored within them as “Lizard Growth Points”. When a Special Lizard with LGP is adjacent to the Den, they can deposit all LGP they currently have, causing a number of Special Lizards (of the same type as the depositor) equal to half of the spent LGP (rounded down) to be born inside of the Den. Special Lizards are generally more competent than typical lizards, usually increasing the effectiveness to any lizard based maneuvers they are added to, even if in a very small way. If a Special Lizard is not attached to a unit and is without a task, they will simply go to latch onto the nearest enemy until Lizzie calls them to return to her. Enemy units can pass through spaces that Special Lizards are on, and Special Lizards die permanently upon being knocked out. If Lizzie ever completely runs out of Special Lizards, she will start the next session she is in at base Special Lizard amount."
passive,Lizzie,ANYTHING FOR MY LIZARD BABIES!!,,,"If one of Lizzie’s summons is about to be destroyed/killed by an incoming attack, she can jump over to them and push them out of the way of the attack, taking the damage herself. The first time she uses this in a combat, Lizzie cannot be reduced lower than 1 stamina from the attack."
ability,Lizzie,BIG LIZARD / small lizard,2!,,"Lizzie pulls out her “Lizard Size Manipulator Ray” and fires it at a chosen target within 5 spaces of her. Depending on which knob she has switched on the gun, the target shall either be shrunk down to the size of the Jaragua Lizard (the smallest lizard, 16 millimeters long), or be generally increased in size, granting a damage/potency buff to units while large. This size fluctuation only lasts for an instant, with affected units reverting to normal size once any interactions involving the size change have been resolved. Once per round. (Prof 11) Extended Embiggening/Ensmallening - BIG LIZARD/small lizard can now make a willing target big/small for an entire turn if they so desire. If used on Lizzie’s turn, and the willing target wants to remain big/small on their turn, they will stay big/small up until and during said turn, but therefore cannot be targeted by this ability during the next round."
ability,Lizzie,Legion of Lizards,X,,"With a cackle, Lizzie sends a gang of lizards off to perform a task of her choosing. At base, they act as a summon with 5 stamina, 5 movement, and a 4 damage basic attack, but by paying larger and larger amounts of stamina, Lizzie can cause more and more lizards to be added to the hivemind. Doing this allows the lizards to take various shapes they can mold themselves into. Lizards created via this ability shall not stop trying to complete their task until it is either accomplished or they die. Upon completing their initial task, they can be redirected to perform a new task. Special Lizards can also be added into/alongside these lizard hiveminds, and upon task completion, she can choose for the Special Lizards to separate from the pack."
ability,Lizzie,Long List of Lizards,3⛯,,"Sussing out potential lizard fanatics among her ranks, Lizzie asks up to three units to try to challenge her by naming a type of lizard she has never heard of. If someone refuses, Lizzie can choose a new unit to take their place. Together, they can come up with whatever lizard based abomination their brains spit out, and of course Lizzie will both have heard of this species and happen to have brought one along with her today. This lizard then acts as one of her summons with stamina, movement, build, abilities, etc. determined by whatever the party concocted. Once per combat."
weapon,Ka,The Slade,,,"Also known as “The Slime Blade” it extends from their own slimy body, deals 5 damage at 1 range at base but they may increase the range of The Slade by reducing the damage by 1 for every 2 range they grant it. They may spend 1 stamina when using it to add a status effect of their choice that isn’t unique to another character’s gimmick. [25] Weapon Slupgrade (Slime Upgrade) - Sleint (Slime Feint) - Whenever Ka makes an attack with The Slade they may choose to feint an obvious attack, expecting it to be countered, dodged somehow otherwise negatively interacted with. If this does occur they may immediately, after the completed action chain, make their true attack which rolls with advantage. If the feint is not countered the attack goes through as normal but either it’s damage is increased by 1.5x rounding up OR increases it’s crit range by 2."
weapon,Ka,Ka's Cleaver,,,"A cool sword that a dude named Ramos made and put up for bet. I kinda won that mega hard so yeah! It’s cool. The blade can cleave or pierce to hit multiple targets at once. It also has the special property of recycling kinetic energy. Whenever the blade lands an attack or is used to block an attack, it stores a charge of power. You may release this power before making a roll to increase the roll, damage, or knockback of the attack. This kinetic energy property doesn’t exist while Ramos isn’t around."
talent,Ka,Sody Pop,,,Ka gains 2 Stored Nat20s to use on either themselves or an ally for the session.
passive,Ka,Adaptable Monster,,,"Ka’s unique physiology and genetic composition grants them the capability to near instantly adapt their own body in response to the environment and attempts to harm them as well as just for fun. Unfortunately the adaptations they make tend to change their mentality bit by bit, slowly changing them from a small innocent cinnamon bun to a hateful creature of anger, destruction and plague (the rate of which is determined by the player). Once per turn, twice per round once as a bonus action and once as an anytime they may roll to try and adapt to a single thing they have been affected by in the combat. This costs 0-10 stamina to do so but they can also spend buff or debuffs they are affected by instead of stamina as well. The adaptations can function as upgrades to existing kit pieces or new kit pieces all together or even just small buffs and resistances. All adaptations generally last until the end of a session, but the GM can force Ka’s adaptations to be given up at any time after the combat the adapted them in. After the session is over Ka’s player may categorise the adaptations they have made into a “Build” and by paying the same amount of stamina, transform into that build at the start of a combat but they must pay 2 stamina upkeep per round to do so and it ends at the end of combat, each build is once per session. Any further adaptations do not add to that build but do not go away with the build. If Ka fails to adapt to something they only pay 2 stamina at max if it were higher. [20] Adaption Upgrade - The Basics - At the start of a session Ka may choose to give themselves one out of a selection of buffs for the rest of the session.

ability,Ka,Body Bomb,1,,"Ka swips their tail around and a small amount of their slime body flies out in three 3x3 spaces up to 3 spaces away. In 6 turns these areas all explode for 4 damage each but Ka can spend X extra stamina to have the areas explode earlier (Max of 4). In addition, if anyone (except Ka) touches those areas they get inflicted with “Blast” which slows their movement by 2 and increases the next instance of damage they take by 1.5x unless it is an explosion in which case it is doubled, the status then goes away. [16] Swishy - Ka can pay an extra 2 stamina to use “Body Bomb” as a movement action."
ability,Ka,Consumption of Evil,0!,,"Ka feels an attacking action passing within 3 spaces of them and leaps to eat it. When they eat it, they take all the damage and effects onto themselves but this completely prevents anyone else from taking the damage and effects. In addition every time they do this they gain a point of “Malice”, once they reach 5 “Malice” they can fire out a 3x100 beam of pure immutable energy that deals 9-15 damage to all units in the centre of the beam and 4-6 damage to all units on the outer edges of the beam. Malice Beam must be used on a perfect straight line or a perfect diagonal and is a main action. Malice Points carry over between combats but not sessions. Once Per Round."

They jump up 5 spaces into the air and bounce into a unit of their choice within 6 spaces of them to deal 6 damage before bouncing up 7 spaces and into another unit of their choice within 8 spaces and hitting them for 8 damage, Ka then lands in a space of their choice in the combat area. This always knocks hit units prone. If Ka has spikes from Crystalline Materia the damage is increased by 2. Recharge 6 on a d6."
ability,Ka,Cringe Adaptor,X,,"Ka’s eyes glint menacingly, they just saw you fuck up, Cringelord. Ka uses the information gained from a unit failing an action and adapts to it in a way of their choice as per “Adaptable Monster” except they can make it more potent than it otherwise might be. If Ka is feeling particularly devious when they adapt to it they can absorb the powers of the one who failed into themselves and create a slightly weaker copy of the action, removing it from the original user for 1 round if they are an inscribed. This cannot be used to copy talents or passives unless they are actions and cannot be used on kit pieces that keep the original user alive or stable in some kind of way. This ability always rolls with a Natural +1. If they copy something with their adaptation they may roll to immediately use it as well by paying its cost. Cost is determined by the GM but is usually between 1-10 and follows the same general rules to their main passive. Can be used as a movement action."
weapon,Aika,Dillastora,,,"A scythe that is enhanced with epithetical energy with an odd clock-like structure where the blade meets the handle. This is a sortof ‘extension’ of Aika’s emotion.

When she is brought below 13, their attacker takes 2 damage and gains 1 tick if they were within 2 range of her. She may choose to have the tick not apply. If drank for...some reason, the drinker will take damage equal to the lifesteal, but depending on how much, they get a damage upgrade and maybe become revitalized in 2d10+5 turns, healing back the damage they took with interest (EX, if they took 5 damage, they would get back 8-10 later)."
passive,Aika,Cambian,,,"Aika, despite her emotionless shell, can really move if she puts her mind to it. People who land piercing or slashing melee attacks on her take 1 damage. Every attack Aika lands on a target gives them a Tick. For every Tick on a target, she gets a +1 to rolling to attack them. If they get to +6, it is reset to 0. Also, as she continues to do damage, she feels more and more alive. “Can emotions do this?” [25] Half Past - After ticks “Reset” the target takes 3 damage, and deals 2 damage to all enemies adjacent. (The adjacent damage does not apply ticks.) [43] Time Passes... - Aika’s maximum Ticks are upped to 9. "
passive,Aika,How Unfortunate,,,"When an enemy targets Aika and rolls a 13, she is allowed to simply teleport out of the way to an unaffected area or cease being there until the danger comes to pass. The attempt against her is specifically counted as a critical failure(meaning no positives can be derived from her). If the enemy targets specifically and only Aika, she vanishes as usual with the attempt being counted as a complete critical failure before she teleports near them. She then takes an action at reduced effectiveness against that target. Up to GM discretion, the person who rolled can do another action at reduced effectiveness if they feel that they’ve been getting clowned on or something, but it must not target Aika if they do so."
ability,Aika,"I-I wasn’t paying attention, s-sorry...",3!,,"Aika flashes back to reality, but she thinks she got most of what you were doing...But maybe she missed a word or two.

Pick one: Instead of 1 turn, the previous 2 turns are ignored."

Perish, or somethin’...",2,,"Aika extends her scythe and swipes up, as in a 1x6 area in front of her, the area grows gray and foggy, as with a snap, everyone in the line takes 4 damage and the first has an additional Tick added. If adjacent to and targeting someone with ⅓ of the maximum Ticks, it becomes a misty pillar that makes their soul slightly fade from reality, dealing 8 damage in a 3x3 area.

weapon,Mehir,Executioner's Cane,,,"4 Damage, 1 Range. A cane used by Mehir to get around. It seems simple enough-- right up until they stab into you with the sharpened tip of the thing! Causes 4 stacks of LC bleed on a roll of 13+"
weapon,Mehir,Gaze,,,"2 Damage, 6 Range. Mehir raises a hand and shoots a twisting colorful orb at a target within 6 spaces, marking them in the process. Mehir may choose to do no damage to have it not count as an attack, be at their sight range instead of just at 6 and be performed as a swift action. This deals Psychic damage."
talent,Mehir,Expansive Soul,,,"Mehir's Soul has incredible room for power and all forms of gaining it. They suffer no drawbacks from having more than one epithet or power system. They also have an easier time awakening new power or meeting a prerequisite for something similar when the opportunity would arise which ranges from it being basically guaranteed to even at the most difficult being twice as likely as a regular person. Additionally, when gaining proficiency, Mehir may gain that same amount of proficiency with an amount of different proflines equal to (class level)d2+1. This is explicitly easier to copy, but any time this is used Mehir always knows what the copier is putting the proficiency into and is able to put proficiency into those same skills."
talent,Mehir,Immutable Sight,,,"Mehir's eyes, as a result of their Epithet, are very special. Since it is the main way the power manifests, it seems the epithet has a keen interest in keeping them inside of Mehir's head. Mehir's eyes are utterly indestructible, unremovable and unable to be otherwise fucked with. Their eyes additionally have any and all special types of sight, from darkvision to blindsight to whatever the fuck, up to a range of 5 times their proficiency. These sights also apply to Mehir’s third eyes."
passive,Mehir,BE EXALTED,,,"Mehir’s desire is to see the most power possible. They want to make the most powerful thing alive and be able to say it was because of them. As an unrolled main action, Mehir may open their eyes and focus their gaze upon someone, bestowing power and enlightenment beyond what they had previously thought possible. This edits every part of their kit to make it terrifyingly powerful(noted in a new absolutely busted character sheet that Rosche makes.) Mehir loses their main actions while they keep this up, but the Awakened target has two main actions and three move actions on their turn until Mehir closes their eyes, with the target additionally having 2 Faster Healing, which causes them to heal whenever they take any kind of action. Mehir must pay a 5 stamina upkeep each round and may only move half of their movement on their turns. Mehir gains proficiency whenever the Awakened target rolls a natural crit. Mehir can switch their Awakening target as a once-per-round 3 cost unrolled anytime. Also, I don’t think I should need to state this but I will anyway. You cannot copy or otherwise fuck with Awakened features. Attempting to do so will simply give you the base or not work in the case of fuckery. Put your hand down, Inev, there’s no exception, even for little goo theys. [55] Unveiling Your Worth - When Rosche is making an awakened sheet, they may make a unique feature for the character in question. If the character particularly enjoys that feature, they may divert a large amount of proficiency, stamina, or other character-specific stats at the upgrade writer’s discretion to learn a weakened version of it. In which case, Rosche may make a new unique feature for that awakened sheet afterwards."
passive,Mehir,Battle Scars,,,"Mehir has suffered so much for so long. Little things do not bother them. Hypersensitivity after being dealt with for a long time gives way to nihilism. Mehir’s senses cannot be overwhelmed by any means and is able to handle pain quite handily by this point, even though they beneficially count as taking 2x of any pain-related effect. Mehir can additionally survive a few extra days without sustenance or sleep than a normal person could. Mehir’s death range is set to that of a Heavyset and additionally, Mehir cannot be knocked to or below their death threshold from one instance of damage. If they would take damage to do so, they are at minimum set to the point before they would die. From there, only a directly intentional attempt on their life will kill Mehir."
ability,Mehir,Piercing Glare,2,,"A glimmering spark of color spreads from Mehir, turning into the shape of eyes. They then spread their arms as the eyes scatter around. Mehir creates 2-6 floating green eyes within 5 spaces of them. Mehir may trigger up to 2 of these eyes as a bonus action or one as a once-per-round anytime, causing the eyes to turn into a twistingly colored beam of energy and shoot forward, dealing 4 (psychic) damage in a 1x(sight) line in a cardinal direction and marking hit targets as per Mehir’s Gaze. If the eye would hit nothing, Mehir can instead stop the beam in any position along the line. Friendly Fire. If a target already has Mehir's Mark when struck, then Mehir may spend their mark without rolling in order to have a new line attack spawn from that person's mark. This can chain until no new marks remain."
ability,Mehir,Premonition,2!,,"Mehir is aware of everything around them, even the near future. No prospect is hidden from their sight. With this ability, it acts as though the previous few moments were a future that Mehir was viewing. They may themselves take an action to avoid this future or command up to two other people to take an action focused specifically on stopping the action from occurring. Once per round.

Mehir gains perfect awareness over that area and on future turns they can spend a bonus action with a variable cost to apply an effect based on imposing their epithet on someone or something within the area. They can also spend 1 stamina as a free action to mark 3 targets within the area. Mehir can only have up to 3 of these areas active at once, with one of them being dispelled if they try to make a fourth. If any target in the area has a mark, Mehir may spend it to affect them as well as what they were trying to target using the bonus action with this ability. "
ability,Mehir,True Colors,3,,"Mehir points to a target and a glowing green third eye appears over their head, marking them. The target must use an ability they have not shown off this combat on their next turn, with a natural roll bonus equal to how many rounds the target has gone without using it. This can only be used after the second round of combat OR if someone has used the same action two turns in a row. Bonus action. If a target was already marked by Mehir and/or has already shown all of their abilities this combat, they take the action immediately.

The natural roll bonus goes down by 1 at the start of Mehir’s turns and when it hits 0 the bonuses go away. Once per Combat. Bonus action.

weapon,Arcadia,Doom Hammer,,,"Forged by her uncle in a Soulburn forge, this massive greathammer has flattened the skulls and dissolved the flesh of many evil-doers.  Contained within the head of the hammer is a serrated iron vault containing reloadable glass vials full of Arcadia’s blood, and when the hammer slams into something, the outermost layer of vials explode into sizzling acid.  The hammer deals 4 damage at 1 range, and if used while loaded, acid explodes around it in a 5 foot radius that inflicts everyone hit with 2 Erosion stacks.  Arcadia can load the hammer (using the pump-action valve on its handle) as a free action when combat begins or by using a movement action and paying 1 Stamina on subsequent turns.  If the hammer is loaded, she can leap through the air up to 3 spaces when she makes her attack.  The hammer can also be loaded multiple times before being used up to a maximum of three charges, and each additional charge increases the radius of the acid explosion by 5 feet and the inflicted Erosion by 1. After making a successful attack with her hammer, if Arcadia wishes, she can transform it into the ‘Scarred Blade’ as a free action, though it can’t be used this turn.  If she does this, the head of the hammer is left behind on the ground, and enemies that step over it or adjacent to it must add 1 Erosion. [9] Basic Weapon Upgrade: +1 damage to hammer. (to 5)    "
weapon,Arcadia,Scarred Blade,,,"The sharpened handle of the Doom Hammer leaves the head behind, its edge gleaming with the blood of both Arcadia and her foes.  This blade deals 6 damage at 1 range, but rather than exploding with acid, the blade simply inflicts 1 Erosion on those it hits with a roll of 10 or higher.  If Arcadia spends 2 Stamina, she can quickly run her tail across the blade to coat it further and then whirl around, hitting all adjacent targets with half of the blade’s damage and 1 Erosion. After making an attack with the blade, if Arcadia wishes, she can transform it into the ‘Doom Hammer’ as a free action, though it can’t be used this turn.  To do this, she must sheathe the blade into the head of the hammer again, meaning she must be adjacent to where she originally transformed it. "
weapon,Arcadia,Wings of Justice,,,"Two small hammers that Arcadia typically keeps on her hips for when she needs to cap a motherfucker.  With acid.  These twin hammers can make two attacks, dealing 3 damage in melee range each, however they also have a ranged component; inside their heads is a small nozzle capable of firing bolts of acid at distant targets.  These bolts can be fired up to 5 spaces away.  When fired, Arcadia makes one roll for each hammer, and each successful hit marks the target with 2 Erosion.  She can fire at two separate targets if she wishes.  After the first two shots she fires, this ranged attack costs 1 Stamina for the remainder of combat. [20] Bird Of Prey - Arcadia’s ‘Wings Of Justice’ gain another mode of attacking.  Rather than the usual ranged acid bullets, Arcadia can instead use them to dash towards a target within 4 spaces of herself, hitting them with the hammers as she dashes by.  This hit deals 2 damage and applies 1 Erosion.  If another target is adjacent to the first, Arcadia continues her assault, hitting them as well (with the same roll as previous).  This can continue infinitely, though if enemies are two spaces apart with each other, she cannot dash to them unless an ally is between the two, meaning she must damage them as well. [23]  Rising Fury - Choose two values on Arcadia’s character sheet that specifically designate stacks of Erosion.  Increase each of them by 1.  This cannot be used on ‘The Balance Of Battle’ if you unlock it at the same time as this. (Wings of Justice, to 3/2)"
talent,Arcadia,"I Have No Pronouns, Do Not Refer To Me",,,"This isn’t actually true, Arcadia identifies as female, she’s just weird about making friends. Whenever Arcadia gains Companionship with someone, the increase is one-sided, with only the other person gaining the Companionship. Arcadia passively learns from those she works with but tries not to get too attached. For every 3 Companionship she earns with anyone (not tracked on an individual basis) she gains 1 Proficiency. When a Companionship upgrade is earned between her and another individual, she does not gain the upgrade until another upgrade is earned, and so on in this pattern."
talent,Arcadia,Martial Technique: Tail Fighting,,,"You have trained your tail to the point that it possesses limited prehensility. You are able to attempt to use your tail to wrap around something to grapple it, attack an adjacent target for three damage, or perform a simple martial maneuver such as a trip or push attack as a bonus action on your turn. If you perform a wide sweeping physical attack or spend your movement attempting to add momentum just before striking a target with your tail it'll deal additional damage and gains a bonus to performing martial maneuvers."
passive,Arcadia,Acidic Blood,,,"Arcadia’s reptilian biology is fascinating to say the least.  Her blood is made of a potent chemical compound that eats away at almost anything it comes in contact with.  Arcadia only takes half damage from acid, including her own, and melee attacks made against her that roll a 15 or lower will cause her blood to splash on the target, marking them with 2 Erosion. [11] Splash Zone - All melee attacks that damage Arcadia now inflict the attacker with 2 Erosion regardless of the roll. ‘Erosion’ is a stacking debuff that Arcadia inflicts on enemies that represents how much of her deadly acid has coated a target.  When Erosion is triggered, the enemy takes damage equal to their Erosion stacks, and the stacks are removed. This damage cannot be reduced except specifically by acid resistance, and even then it is not as effective as usual.  Erosion is triggered when two full rounds pass without an enemy gaining any Erosion stacks.  Erosion can be cleansed like other debuffs but usually only by a few stacks at a time.  At certain amounts of stacks, a target suffers additional effects, which stack with all previous effects.  Note that these effects can be cleansed without the Erosion itself being cleansed. 3 Erosion:  Physical DR or other means of protection, like armor or a shield, is only half as effective on this target. 5 Erosion:  The target’s movement speed is halved. 7 Erosion:  Healing the target receives is halved and their Stamina costs increase by 1. 10 Erosion:  The target takes 1 additional damage from damage that Arcadia deals to them. 12 Erosion:  The target takes 1 further damage from all sources."

ability,Arcadia,Death and Decay,3,,"Arcadia snarls, her pupils dilating fiercely as she unleashes a devastating attack against her enemies.  Arcadia can choose either one target or target a 3x3 area up to 5 spaces away.  Her weapon must be in Doom Hammer mode to use this ability. Single Target:  Twirling her hammer around herself like it’s weightless, Arcadia smashes it into the skull of the target and sends them flying 5 spaces away, dealing 7 damage and inflicting 3 Erosion in the process if the hammer was loaded when she made this attack.  If the target collides with something, they take additional damage depending on what they hit.  Their next roll has a -2 penalty. 3x3 Area:  Arcadia leaps through the air and smashes her hammer down into the earth, creating a small crater in the impact zone.  All targets in the area are knocked outside of it and take 4 damage.  If the hammer was loaded when she made this attack, they’re also inflicted with 2 Erosion.  The area she hit then becomes difficult terrain and inflicts 1 Erosion to those who enter the area or start their turn there. [16] Steel From The Sky - Arcadia can now use ‘Death And Decay’ with her Scarred Blade, which mildly changes the properties of the attack she performs. Single Target: The target only takes 6 damage and 1 Erosion, but if they’re using a physical melee weapon, Arcadia flourishes her blade and disarms them, disabling its use for one round. Their next roll still has a -2 penalty. 3x3 Area: No Erosion is inflicted upon the initial impact (though the difficult terrain effect still happens) and targets are not knocked away. Instead, Arcadia can immediately spend 1 Stamina to use the AOE version of Scarred Blade’s attack."
ability,Arcadia,Scales of Justice,2!,,"They must be balanced at all costs, for otherwise there is no justice at all.  Arcadia focuses for a moment, her blood boiling in her veins, before a green haze emerges from her weapon and the pores in her skin.  The haze affects two targets of Arcadia’s choice within 4 spaces of herself.  They are bound to each other by justice, and therefore all changes to each target’s Stamina are shared by the other for the next two rounds.  This can be used in response to attacks or abilities to make the damage and Stamina costs taken apply to the other immediately.  She can end this effect early on her turn if she wishes.  Note that if one of the targets is an ally, the maximum Stamina they can lose in response to the paired target’s Stamina cost is 5.  Only two targets can be affected by this at once.  The cost and damage of Outclasses or Overclasses does not apply.  Once per round."
ability,Arcadia,Broken Earth,2,,"Even the earth beneath Arcadia’s feet is not safe from her wrath.  She moves up to 3 spaces and lashes out with either her hammer or sword, whatever form it’s currently taking, she tears a hole through the earth itself that’s filled with boiling acid in the rift created.  If she uses her hammer, the rift in the earth is 10 feet deep and takes up a 3x3 area.  With her sword, the rift is 5 feet deep and is lashed outwards in a 1x6 space line.  Targets in the respective areas must make a resist roll to avoid falling into the acid, the roll for which must be higher than Arcadia’s roll for this attack.  If they’re successful, they are able to dodge to the side; if they are not, they fall into the acid and gain 3 Erosion.  These areas remain for 2 rounds.  This ability is a bonus action."
ability,Arcadia,Boiling Judgement,1!,,"Arcadia’s rage manifests even through blood she has lost, and can cause the acid inflicted on an enemy to flare in potency.  An enemy of Arcadia’s choice who is marked with Erosion suddenly takes damage equal to half of their current Erosion stacks (rounded down), and then gains one more.  This can interrupt attacks on good rolls or if high amounts of damage are dealt.  Once per round. [23]  Rising Fury - Choose two values on Arcadia’s character sheet that specifically designate stacks of Erosion.  Increase each of them by 1.  This cannot be used on ‘The Balance Of Battle’ if you unlock it at the same time as this. (to 2)"
ability,Hebi Hebi No Mi Model Basilisk,Stone Gaze,3,,"A single target who locks eyes with you must make a roll. They gain Petrify stacks equal to how much lower their roll is compared to the roll for this ability, with a max of 5. Crits double this cap but otherwise do nothing."
ability,Hebi Hebi No Mi Model Basilisk,Stone Shift,3!,,"Normal and Hybrid form only. Shift a part of your body to stone. This gives you any number of Petrify stacks you want, and in return gives you 3 DR /acid until the start of your next turn equal to the Petrify placed on you."
ability,Hebi Hebi No Mi Model Basilisk,Venom Shock,1,,Hybrid and Full form only. Spit out acid in a 3 range cone. This deals 4 acid damage to everyone inside.
weapon,Wendrow,Chompers,,,Wendrow’s favorite weapon; a 3-headed flail with heads that have eyes and teeth. He can swing it up to 2 spaces away for 6 damage. [39] Weapon Upgrade - Three Heads Are Biter Than One - Wendrow can now have the heads of his flail attack up to 3 targets at once so long as they are adjacent to either him or each other. They deal 3 damage to each.
talent,Wendrow,Soul Treat,,,"When Wendrow rolls a critical success while attacking or using a damaging ability on a target he can take 1 max stamina from them and add it to his own total permanently. If he hits many people in an AOE, he can only take from up to 3 people. This may also proc from summons once per summon per combat. Additionally, Wendrow may choose to gain max stamina instead of proficiency when he crits."
talent,Wendrow,Ghost with the Most,,,"Wendrow is resistant to necrotic damage, only taking up to half of it when he would be affected by it."
talent,Wendrow,Forceful Life-Force,,,"Wendrow may from now on, count as a mini-powerhouse for the sake of gaining stamina from combat rewards as his soul starts to require more lifeforce to maintain. All stamina rewards from combat Wendrow gets multiplied by 1.25x"
ability,Wendrow,Arise And Serve Your King,X,,"Wendrow brings any one concept or physical thing around him in the area to life, causing it to fight by his side and have a special effect based on what it is. This ability costs more depending on the size of the object and what special ability it would have. He cannot bring things that are more by 3x3 to life. A 1x1 object ordinarily has 5 stamina, 6 movement, and a 3 damage melee attack, a 2x2 object has 10 stamina, 4 movement, and a 5 damage melee attack, and a 3x3 object has 15 stamina, 3 movement, and a 7 damage melee attack. These statistics could be different based on the object, like if a construct would feasibly have more of a ranged attack than a melee one, or if it would have less HP due to being brittle. It is generally much easier to bring to life things that are close to him(being laughably easy when it’s adjacent) and much harder to bring things to life that are further than 6 spaces away. [31] Arise And Serve Your King - When using “Come Forth” Wendrow can put little a bit more of his soul into the summon, as a treat to create a Super Summon. When he does this the new Super Subject is infused with more powers from the thing it is made out of allowing Wendrow to create a miniature kit for them, they also have slightly higher base stats than usual too. He must choose to do this before rolling and he can only do this once ever, so choose wisely, the usage is not spent if he fails to do so even with a nat 1."
ability,Wendrow,Soul Renewal,2,,"All of Wendrow’s summons and one ally of his choice heal for 4 stamina and gain a +2 to their next action. While the ally may heal, they only gain a +1 to their next action. If a summon has a special ability that is a number of times per round or combat, he can restore one use to a single summon, but only once per summon per combat."
ability,Wendrow,Protect Your King!,1!,,"Wendrow quickly brings an object to life near him, making it throw itself in front of him to block an attack. If he brings that object back to life later using Come Forth, it gains a special effect based on the attack. Ordinarily objects brought to life by this aren’t instantly destroyed upon taking this hit, but if they are used over and over they may be. 1x1 objects typically last 2-3, 2x2 typically last for 3-4, and 3x3 typically last for 4-5, though this is dependent on material. [43] Trial By Fire - When using Protect Your King on existing subjects, Wendrow can have the subject take x1.5 the damage but in return they gain an effect based on the nature of the attack for the rest of combat. This can be done once per subject in combat. [RB] Take Center Stage - When Wendrow uses Protect Your King, he can, instead of calling up a random item, pull out one of his subjects! This subject will take the damage for Wendrow and go back, missing half of their stamina(rounded down) at max from this damage when Wendrow brings them out next. They will also apply for Trial By Fire in this way."
ability,Wendrow,Bow To The Power of My Soul!,3,,"Wendrow raises his hand and squeezes, dealing 5 damage to enemies within a 3x3 area as a sparkling pink swirl of energy drains their souls, giving them a -3 to their next roll. Any friendly summons in the area have a +3 to their next roll. [58] I Said BOW, Worm! - Wendrow can increase the area of this to a 5x5. The damage is increased by 1 to 6 and his own summons in that area gain a +5 to their next roll."
ability,Wendrow,Unified Soul,4⛯,,"Wendrow calls upon his subjects and fuses some of them together into a new form, creating a sort of Royal Guard-like construct. This new subject can be of up to a 4x4 size and is made of up to 3 existing subjects, so long as their added size categories do not go above the 4x4 of the fusion added together. This new subject has the combined abilities and aspects of all it’s parts, an average of 20 stamina, 4 movement and a 10 damage melee basic attack at maximum size. It also fully heals any damage that might have been done to its base parts. This isn’t without its drawback however, the fusion is a permanent choice that cannot be undone, in addition, to keep it permanently maximum stamina must be paid in accordance with all of it’s base parts that were not already permanent subjects and finally, if this fusion were to die it is a permanent loss. Royal Guards cannot be fused together and he can only have 3 permanently, he can choose to keep a new one over an existing one but it will cost extra max stamina to do so and the old one is lost to him. Once per combat. This ability cannot critically fail."
weapon,Clothos,Clothier's Needles,,,"4 Damage, 3 Range. Clothos’ ‘weapons’ are an assortment of almost insectoid limbs which extend from underneath their large coat, with tips that are pointed like spears! Whenever they attack, Clotho may choose to double the amount of threads they’ll receive from the attack, or choose to not gain any threads to add an aspect of one of the threads they currently have to the attack. [17] Patchwork Fix - Clothos can use Clothier's Needles on an ally, not dealing damage and instead removing a status or debuff currently afflicting them. When using this, Clothos can choose to gain Threads as normal, or they can have the Threads fused with aspects of the removed status/debuff. This naturally muddies the base unit’s inherent DNA a bit. This also heals the targeted unit for 1 Stamina."
talent,Clothos,Dream Weaver,,,"Clothos can sense the emotions of people around them with extreme accuracy and can most often accurately understand what a person truly wants, either at the moment or in totality. They can also float and change their appearance."
talent,Clothos,Drive to Weave,,,"Clothos feels very passionate about their job! So passionately, in fact, that they VIOLENTLY desire to get their threads! Clothos gets a stacking roll buff equal to ½ of how many threads they need before they can get to max."
talent,Clothos,"For You See, I Am Creechur",,,"While Clothos is affecting a unit with one of their actions, they can zip around them at cartoonish gremlin speed, making sure to observe their work from every angle. More specifically, while performing and immediately after performing the action, Clothos can choose to be in any space adjacent to the affected unit (or even on top of them, though there’s no guarantee that that will be safe for them). To clarify, this does not naturally allow them to dodge counterattacks or things of the sort outright, but it may make counterattacks very slightly more difficult. If counterattacks fail, it can certainly be flavored that Clothos just booped around them."
passive,Clothos,A Pleasant Suit or Fancy Dress~,,,"Clothos is a...creature, born to weave! Not even they quite know what their species is but they know they are very well equipped to make some of the finest fabrics this side of the planet!~ Whenever Clothos uses something from their kit that would affect another person, they take a ‘thread’ from that person. Once Clothos receives 8 ‘threads,’ they may choose to create an article of clothing as an unrolled main action! This cloth counts as a new passive with effects directly based on the person the most threads are from and the second-most frequent person. If someone was responsible for more than half of the threads, the clothing has a much closer leaning to them and will come without the ‘negative first combat’ with it if the clothing is given to them. These clothes are ordinarily worn by Clothos but they can be bought from them! They...unfortunately don’t know a lot about real currency, so they’ll generally ask to bite you to get a good amount of your blood! This will effectively let them drain 3 stamina from you!... Or I guess you could give them a neat item or something. The clothes are made via their epithet and thus are generally soul-bound unless the user would not want them to be. Anyone who puts on an article of clothing from Clothos for the first time will note that it feels strangely…*alive.* It’s somewhat unnerving. For the first combat you have the clothing, the effects of the passive are either halved in effectiveness or made somehow negative. [12] Ties That Bind - Whenever Clothos has something of theirs copied or altered, or they and/or their essence is somehow directly connected to someone else, they can pay 1 or 2 Stamina to gain Threads of the copier/alterer/connected person equal to the amount of Stamina paid. [20] Yearning Yarn - When Clothos obtains Threads from someone, instead of taking from their DNA, they can choose to instead take from their current emotions or desires. Depending on the exact nature of the emotions/desires, this may or may not require Clothos to pay variable amounts of Stamina, although typically not very much. When making clothes via A Pleasant Suit or Fancy Dress~, if a particular emotion/desire Thread is not already, Clothos can choose for that Thread to automatically become the secondary property of the clothes’ effect(s)."
ability,Clothos,Seams of Desire,2,,"A small smile creeps along Clothos’ face as their eyes glow a light blue. They then quickly dash up to a target and take out their various sewing limbs before beginning to  ‘weave’ them with a violent fervor. This optionally deals 5 damage and lets Clothos add, change, or replace any part of their body with another organic fixture. This most often is used to benefit others, but can definitely be used to hinder someone else. The effect will decay by 1 for every one of Clothos’ turns that pass. Clothos may make a single roll on their turn in order to prevent one of the effects from decaying, but it only succeeds on a 10+. Also, people who enjoy the change can choose to give up variable maximum stamina(usually 1-3) to Clothos in order to keep whatever it ends up as! It will probably be written into an actual passive or little perk at that point if it was mechanically useful, but otherwise is just a thing they have."
ability,Clothos,Ball of Yarn,2!,,"Clothos constantly leaves little threads wherever they bump into for later, but sometimes they make these threads juuust a bit too tight and let their epithet do the work. So long as they were adjacent to a solid surface or other character, Clothos may secretly use this as they move by paying the cost whenever they do so, allowing for a tripwire to be set. When sprung(which is done by moving into any unoccupied square it takes up,) Clothos rolls for it. If successful, the enemy takes 4 damage and is strung up in the air, forcibly ending their movement and dealing extra damage if they forcibly move far past it. This ball of yarn can be made of one of their threads as well. If Clothos is in range of the enemy that is strung up, they may use this anytime for 3 stamina instead in order to assail them with their weaving needles, effectively restraining all but their arms and head and allowing Clothos to follow up with two basic attacks at halved damage OR any of their abilities without taking up usages at weakened effectiveness."
ability,Clothos,Let's Get You Fitted,3,,"Clothos quickly slides up next to an ally and feels them up, before getting a sudden epiphany! They reach back underneath their coat and pull out a beautiful top for them to wear, made of an impossibly fine fabric!~ This fabric gives the target one of a few strong buffs, and may be expended to use as an anytime, at the cost of losing the clothes. A person may only have one of these clothes at a time. Clothos may use this ability on themself in order to simply apply one of the buffs like that. (Buffs: +2 crit range, +4 to attacking rolls, +3 to attacking damage, +3 movement and the ability to move-act-move, +2 Fast Healing). Diamond Defense (1!) - The clothing, in response to an attack, instantly lunges off of the person and calcifies into a diamond-tough chitinous shell. This shell blocks and stops the entirety of an attack. If put in the path of them, the shell also blocks line attacks from passing it as well. This only fails on rolls of 1-3 and critical successes on it give proficiency to Clothos."
weapon,Roarke,Slim Fit Chainsaws,,,"Roarke’s weapons of choice take the form of dual-wielded blades outfitted with chainsaw blades. When he wants to rev them, he typically bites down onto their cranks and pulls with all his might. Deal 5 damage as melee weapons. They are particularly good at tearing through surfaces. [17] Weapon Upgrade - Slim Fit Chainsaws either gets a +1 to damage, Additionally, when activated, Roarke yanks the chains really hard to the point where sparks fly, potentially allowing him to incorporate fire damage or sparks in general when attacking with this weapon."
weapon,Roarke,Rage Induced Elbow,,,"Normally, Roarke is supposed to be a fighter who’s advantages are within close range. However, all is fair in love and war, and that includes being absolutely filthy. With this attack, Roarke jams his elbow forward, producing a small burst of energy upon a target anywhere on the battlefield. This only deals 1 damage, but is a once per round anytime that can knock hit targets up to 3 spaces back on hit. [47] HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! GRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAHH!! - Rage Induced Elbow now has an additional usage per round that can only be used on Roarke’s turn and costs 2 Stamina. Roarke can also use an entire Level Up to gain a single, additional usage of Rage Induced Elbow that costs 1 Stamina. Each time a Level Up usage is used within the same turn, its cost doubles. The cost of the extra usages also doubles if one of Roarke’s inherent uses of Rage Induced Elbow are used in the same turn."
talent,Roarke,And Look What Else I Can Do!,,,"Roarke is incredibly flexible, to the point where he can pretty much contort himself in whatever way and dislocate and relocate his joints without issue."
talent,Roarke,Wild Speak,,,"With a combination of Gurzil’s head and Roarke’s own...existence, Roarke is able to speak with animals. Perhaps even better than he can with humans…"
talent,Roarke,I CONTROL THE FLOW OF BATTLE!! GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!,,,"Roarke gains +1 movement speed! Along with this, Roarke can funnel unspent movement into knockback on any of his offensive actions!"
passive,Roarke,Unleashing the Beast,,,"Ever since donning the head of Gurzil, the fates that be have been trying to get it away from this absolute moron. This manifests in the apparition of red-orange chains (not dissimilar to the chains binding Roarke to Gurzil’s head), which Roarke is forced to always be on guard for. At the end of Roarke’s turns, he can roll to see if a chain pillar is about to shoot up from the ground underneath him. If this roll succeeds, Roarke senses the disturbance and jumps to any space adjacent to his current location. These chains remain on that battlefield until they are attacked, and if Roarke manages to hit them during his attacks, their damage is increased by 1.5x and pass through DR. At the same time, breaking a chain pillar also increases the level of one of his abilities of his choice (aside from an ability used to break the chain). [24] Hey, These Things Are ACTUALLY Pretty Useful!! - Roarke’s put so much effort into spitting in the face of fate by dodging the chains chasing him, that he hadn’t even realized that he could probably bait them out! At the start of his turn, Roarke can pay 3 stamina, causing Gurzil’s godly energy to flare out while he screams into the sky, daring God (or what have you) to just try and catch him. This causes the chain effect Unleashing the Beast typically afflicts at the end of Roarke’s turn to happen at the start of it, except as a guaranteed success! Doing this makes it so the usual end of turn proc rolls with Disadvantage. Conversely, if Roarke does not use this at the start of his turn, the end of turn proc now automatically succeeds. [39] These Shackles Only Free Me More!! - When Roarke shatters a chain from Unleashing the Beast, he gains 3 movement during his current turn (next turn if the chain is shattered out of turn) which he can use even to Move-Act-Move. If Roarke uses his entire Level Up, he can also gain an additional Movement Action which can be used on one of his turns (his choice). [44] Ride the Power High - Roarke has gotten far more accustomed to Gurzil’s power flowing through him, and- WAIT NO!! I CAN FEEL IT GOING AWAY!! GET BACK HERE!!! Roarke can now carry Level Ups between Combats (but not Sessions). However, for each Level Up instance he carries over, he must pay 1 Stamina (which is taken after end-of-combat healing). Additionally, at the start of combat, Roarke can pay 3 Stamina to roll 1dX, with X being equal to the amount of abilities he has. After the result has been rolled, Roarke can Level Up the correlating ability once. As an additional ruling before it is asked, keeping Beast Slash 1 - Mad Bull Rush’s Level Up that makes it not Once per Combat makes it so it cannot be Leveled Up further until Roarke no longer has the upgrade (assuming he keeps it between combats in the first place)."
passive,Roarke,Beast Mode,,,"THERE’S NO STOPPING ME NOW!! I’LL SHOW YOU!! GAHAHAHAHA!! Gurzil’s energy is incredibly volatile, and with Roarke’s body being as it is, said energy can tear through his body like burning blood. As a Once per Combat Free Action, Roarke can force Gurzil’s influence to flare far past what would be safe, paying half of his current stamina (rounding up). Alternatively, if Roarke takes over half of his current stamina in damage, he can choose to attempt to activate Beast Mode immediately, although he needs to roll (he can only activate it this way Once per Session, which shares the Once per Combat usage). Upon activating Beast Mode, Roarke’s entire body is swathed in Gurzil’s signature green and red flames, as a tiger’s roar emanates throughout the area and Roarke feels his soul burn. Roarke can Level Up all of his abilities once and gains an additional Main Action on his turns. Roarke cannot use the same Main Action twice in one turn, unless he failed the first Main Action, and this additional Main Action cannot be used to double move. Units cannot block or interrupt Roarke’s actions while he is in Beast Mode, only being able to dodge (unless they are especially more powerful than he is). If Roarke targets the same unit twice in one turn, damage he deals may be proliferated. Beast Mode lasts for 1d2 Rounds."
ability,Roarke,Beast Slash 1 - Mad Bull Rush,3,,"Steam pours out from Gurzil’s nostrils as Roarke screams and dashes forward with revved chainsaw blades. He runs his movement +1 spaces forward, as the chainsaws make this attack take up a 3 space wide line. Anyone hit by the dash takes 4 damage initially and is dragged with Roarke to the end of his movement. At the end of the movement, Roarke digs the chainsaws into a target in the space directly in front of him, dealing another 5 damage to them, and then spins around on them as if they were a stripper pole. This deals yet another 3 damage to everyone adjacent to the spinning Roarke, and he ends the ability by leaping up to 3 spaces in a direction of his choice. Once per combat. Upon each level up, Roarke can choose to: Boost the amount of spaces in the dash by 1. Boost the amount of damage dealt via the chainsaw attack after the initial dash by 1. Boost the amount of spaces he can travel with the final leap by 1. Remove this ability’s once per combat limitation. Doing this makes it so this ability can no longer be leveled up for the rest of the combat."
ability,Roarke,Beast Slash 2 - Instinct Sense,2/1!,,"Harnessing both his own and Gurzil’s beastly senses, Roarke produces a 3x3 godly aura centered on himself. Activating this costs 2 stamina, and the aura stays in the location that it was summoned. Roarke can innately sense anything within the aura, and as a 1 stamina once per round anytime, he can teleport to any space within the aura and perform a basic attack. Upon using this teleport, the aura dissipates. Upon each level up, Roarke can choose to: Boost one of the dimensions of the aura by 1. Boost the damage of all basic attacks performed in the aura by 1. Give each aura area 1 extra usage before dissipation. [19] Cloud the senses of anyone in the aura, giving anyone aside from Roarke a -5 when standing in the aura. Doing this makes it so this ability can no longer be leveled up for the rest of the combat. [36] Godly Realm - When the area produced by Beast Slash 2 - Instinct Sense is on the field, Roarke and his allies gain advantage on rolls that are purely damaging and/or knockback based so long as they stay inside of it. Along with this, the basic attack used during the anytime version of this ability does not need to roll, being counted as an average success with no additional properties. If Roarke desires, he can choose to roll for the basic attack (without the advantage granted via this upgrade) in order to potentially gain greater results."
ability,Roarke,Beast Slash 3 - Slashing Within,1,,"Roarke screams (as per usual) while using Gurzil’s power to temporarily fuse one of his blades with one of his body parts. The “sword” is then enveloped in a godly aura as it grows to be 5 spaces long. Being hit by this ability deals 4 damage initially, but marks hit targets/objects with a “Mark of the Beast”. If something has the Mark of the Beast on it, Roarke can instead activate this ability with that thing as the base, forcibly converting a part of them into a sword for the attack. This version also marks hit things. Only up to 2 things can have a Mark of the Beast at them at a time. Upon each level up, Roarke can choose to: Increase the range of the sword by 1. Cause activation via Mark of the Beast to deal +1 damage to afflicted units. Increase the amount of things able to have a Mark of the Beast by 1. [28] Slash Happy - When activating Beast Slash 3 - Slashing Within, Roarke can choose to produce multiple blades at a time: one on himself, and one from any number of Marks of the Beast on the field. He can swing them all at once, however, they all share a range stat, having to be divided between them all."
ability,Roarke,Beast Slash 4 - Whirling Devil,3,,"Clutching both chainsaw blades with an intense grip, Roark performs a blisteringly fast spin slash. This ability can then either simply damage everyone adjacent to Roarke for 6 damage, inflicting bleed status on rolls of 16 or higher which deals 1d3 damage at the start of afflicted units’ turns, or as a remote chakram. If used as a chakram, Roarke channels the spinning momentum and tosses his blades up to 3 spaces away from him. The blades continue spinning in a 3x3 area, dealing 4 damage to anyone aside from Roarke upon entry and turn start. Every time someone is damaged by the chakram, their movement is reduced by one, and they regain 1 movement at the start of their next turn not inside the chakram. Maintaining the chakram requires a 1 stamina upkeep at the start of Roarke’s turns, and he is unable to use his chainsaw blades for anything else while they are being used as the chakram. If the chakram is used, this ability cannot be used again for the rest of combat. Upon each level up, Roarke can choose to: Decrease the roll needed to inflict bleed by 1. Increase the amount of spaces Roarke can throw the chakram by 1. Increase the amount of damage the chakram deals per hit by 1."
ability,Roarke,Beast Slash 5 - Persistent Nightmare,1!,,"After a massive reel backwards, Roarke slashes the air in front of him, producing a red, green, and black “X” tear in space. This X stays on the arena until an enemy or enemy projectile makes contact with it. If an enemy hits the X, they are hit for 2 damage that is unaffected by DR, and they are knocked prone. If an enemy projectile hits the attack, it is absorbed and Roarke heals for half damage rounded down. Once per round. Upon each level up, Roarke can choose to: Increase the amount of damage the X by 1. Increase the amount healed via absorption by 1. Increase the range that Roarke can place Xs from by 1. [19] Increase the size category of the X by 1."
weapon,Korima,The *Debugger*,,,"Korima replaces his old crossbow, summoning forth a unique SMG with a dragon's mouth barrel design. It has the same statistics, but he may use it 3 times in one action. Hitting the same target multiple times with it will only generally be half effective on the consecutive strikes. This gun also has the property of intaking Korima's Aura to 'debug' the world around it, letting him, for example, very easily clear up terrain or status effects in return for it not dealing any damage with those shots. He can also fire the gun into technology to ‘heal’ or ‘repair’ them and/or have it travel out of any interconnected devices. [30] +1 Damage [43] You NEED A Small Upgrade After That Shit - Once per combat effect which allows him to get a property of the target and turn it into a free flash drive."

This increases their companionship stat together by 3!!! This can only proc once per person in a session! [76] Strength Of Our Bonds - Korima loves feeling close to their friends at all times. They think that having keepsakes to remember each-other with is the best thing, but why just make the keepsakes a vanity piece in nature? Whenever Korima has a friend who has both a friendship bracelet from them and 15+ companionship, they reach deep, DEEP within themselves, clutching onto their very soul, all of the emotions they feel for their friend…and pull out a special weapon or item to commemorate their bond! Made of digital material, friendship and their friend’s given aesthetic, this item will grow with their bond and is symbolic for their friendship, taking on a shape that would be most fitting. Both Korima and the other person can use this token of friendship whenever they would desire, but it is much stronger when they are together! Korima and the other person’s players work together to create this item. Additionally, whenever they crit they can choose to gain 2 companionship(which are rounded down from Korima's talent) to give out either then or at the end of combat instead of proficiency."

talent,Korima,Lowercase Dragon,,,"Korima’s gotten a much better idea of how to edit his new half-organic body! He’s made himself a pair of digital wings that resemble those that his draconic form had, but more refined and natural. They give him +2 movement and allow him to fly! However Korima can sacrifice wings in order to benefit his party, letting them fall off whenever he pleases, healing all allies in his Pack Tactics area for 6 stamina and giving them +1 movement for 2 rounds. If he only has 1 wing he can still fly, but if he ends the movement still in the air he will fall. Korima regains one of his wings after every hour or at the end of a combat."
passive,Korima,Data Doesn't Die!,,,"Korima is functionally immortal, coming back at the end of combat if his boss is around or otherwise just appearing next to them/somewhere in the DBAtabase if he should die!

passive,Korima,Pack Tactics!!!,,,"While Korima is adjacent to an ally, they gain a +3 to the first roll they take while adjacent to him, and if at least one ally is adjacent to an enemy Korima gains a +3 to rolls when acting against that enemy(this also works vise versa)!

Bowgun - Korima's weapon of choice, a gun that shoots arrows at high speeds! His boss gave it to him as a 'Hey, wow, you exist!' Gift.

passive,Korima,He's Just So Dang Cute!,,,Korima can roll once to befriend people who would usually not care for him or directly hate him...Cuz he’s just so sweet! He even squeaks when you squeeze him.~ These rolls cannot be affected by allies or enemies when they’re made.
passive,Korima,KORIMAAA!,,,"If Korima would get knocked out, they can make one final sacrifice for his friends. They instant transmission to a target of their choice, exploding and dealing 5 damage to them. Everyone, mourning the loss of their friend, gets a +4 to their next attacking roll. If they do this, they die."
passive,Korima,Power Of Friendship,,,"Korima’s come to internalize the amount of care and belief he has in his friends, their bonds fueling his own self-image until it reaches a boiling point. As of getting this passive, Korima’s mundie type becomes ‘Synchro.’ On top of this, his body becomes half-organic and the emotions culminating within him have allowed him to gain a real mortal soul! With it comes a powerful well of ‘Ki’-like energy which Korima calls *‘Frienergy.’* Frienergy has a maximum equal to Korima’s current total amount of Companionship/10 (rounded down) and can be spent at any time to support allies or invest within himself! If he is missing any, Frienergy's current total is increased by 1 by critically succeeding, reaching a new maximum amount, having a particularly friendly or poignant interaction and every time the hour rolls over, with it otherwise restored to full at the end of a session. He can only spend a maximum of 5 Frienergy per round (unless he has more than 5 allies), but he does not need to roll to use it. 1 point can be used to boost a roll by 4, be able to affect any of his allies with something he's doing no matter where he is, or to simply gain 1 unmodified companionship with someone. 2 points can be used to add a supportive effect to an action currently taking place, let someone act immediately for a dual tech, or give someone just enough to get something they’re just short of doing. 3 points can heal a target by 1d8+2 or cause a supportive action to be used as a lower amount of action economy. 4 points can be spent to double the effectiveness of a dual tech or re-cast a supportive action on someone of Korima’s choice. 5 points can be used in order to save someone from a knock-out blow, the power of Korima’s belief in them negating the attack they would have taken, healing them for 2d6+3, and giving them a general buff to damage, rolls, or whatever would be most helpful at the time. Once per combat per person."
ability,Korima,Kode Scrambler,1!,,"Korima shouts in surprise and his body glitches out into lines of spare code. His body reforms up to 5 spaces away from his original position, hopefully dodging whatever caused such a scare! Of course, his code does fuck with technology in subtle ways if he passes through them."
ability,Korima,Copy/Paste!,2!,,Korima selects something within 6 spaces of him and copies it. He can use a main action to paste it and recreate the copy to make it work for him! He can have up to 3 copies at a time and a 4th one would replace the earliest copy.
ability,Korima,Victory Favors the 'Bold,3,,"Korima takes out a fucking anti-material rifle. The shots for this gun are powered by flash drives that Korima keeps on him. The shots, when a flash drive is slotted into them, pierce targets and deal 7 damage at 8 range. and can spend them all at once or save them for intersparing use. If he uses all shots at once, this costs 5 stamina. The shots are made of a very specific material and cannot ordinarily be copied or just simply pulled from nowhere. Flash Drive (1!) - Korima gets this ability when he gets Victory Favors the ‘Bold. He can use the flash drive to download from mostly anything, be it effects that are on organic organisms to data from computers, and convert it into data to make special properties for a bullet he can shoot from his anti-material rifle or he can upload the data of the property to another ally's weapon. This doesn’t USUALLY steal the properties unless he rolls a 15+, which would weaken that property from what he takes from if he chooses. He can use this as a swift action or anytime, whichever would be more beneficial. He has 3 flash drives usually and he resets to that amount at the start of a combat. [Ridbi Upgrade] Korima now carries around 5 flash drives!!!"
ability,Korima,Shout of Inspiration,1!,,"Korima rubs the Pin of Lenin before they call out to their friend, telling them how much they mean to them and how strong they knows they are. Korima can inspire them to push further, do better, letting them reroll their most recent roll!"
ability,Korima,Get 'Em!,3⛯,,"Korima, following the strategy of his fights against the bosses, Korima and all of his friends (allies) dog pile the target! Everyone on Korima’s team (clones and mooks included) goes within basic attack range of the target and everyone rolls to make an attack! This strategy may be simple, but boy is it effective! Once per Combat."
ability,Korima,Kodebold Antivirus Tactics,3,,"Korima reaches under his cloak and gives a devious grin. He thrusts his hand forward suddenly, throwing 1d2+3 odd-looking devices with Korima’s face on them. These devices are digi-traps, which Korima’s specially rigged with many different options to be sure he’s ready for every situation! He can trigger each digi-trap on the field once per round, with the first two he triggers being an automatic success if he chooses for it to be. All of the digi-traps stay until they are specifically destroyed by using an attack on them. After being triggered/the timer goes up, the trap resets back to it’s little disc form so they can take up a new form after. Korima may also use this without taking up the recharge and as a 1 cost as a Motion Detector mode, which will ping Korima any time anything moves in a line past it. Recharge 10. Firewall - Bounces any attack that intersects the space this trap is in with great force, resetting the range and forcing it to go in a direction of Korima’s choice! This firewall stays active for 3 turns before the trap resets. Bear Trap - Stops the movement of the one who walked over it immediately and deals 4 damage before rooting them in place. The person stuck will need to spend a main action or roll with a move action to escape, needing to roll over an 8 to escape and taking another 4 damage on a fail. This trap resets after the roll to escape is succeeded, or when it’s failed twice. Mine - A blast of red, digital energy bursts forth from the trap, dealing 8 damage to the person in the space the trap is on, 5 to all adjacent spaces and 3 to all on that outer ring, while knocking them all 4 spaces away and applying a ‘Defragged’ status to them. 'Defragged' allows Korima to remove 1d4 words from a random one of the enemy's abilities when it is used. This trap resets after being triggered. Magnet - Pulls any enemy projectiles towards it and renders them inert, by converting them into a flash drive that can be grabbed and used by others like Korima's usual flash drives. Stays until destroyed or it pulls in 3 projectiles, after which it will reset and that trap cannot be put into this form again. Telepad - Warps anything that passes into the space of the first one to any other telepad or untriggered trap. Tele-pads stay as they are for 3 turns before it resets. While active, Korima’s Pack Tactics aura acts as though it originates from that space."
weapon,Fukura,Shocking Memory,,,"1 Damage, 6 Range. Fukura harnesses her mental signals and pushes it out, sending a shock into someone else that affects their mind and body. Deals very little damage, but incurs a roll debuff on the target. During that target’s turn, Fukura may choose one of their rolls and force it to be at -3 penalty. Range is calculated purely on horizontal distance, vertical distance is not taken into account. [30] Exploit Weakness - When using her basic attack on a target she’s already used “Observe” on, Fukura can specifically target that weakness, letting her apply her roll debuff as disadvantage instead so long as the target roll involves that weakness in some way. [34] Ghost Shocker - If Fukura rolls a 12+ on her basic attack, it leaves a small electrical imprint on the target, causing them to take 1 damage any time they take any type of action (this includes bonus, movement, free, etc.). This lasts for 1d3 rounds, and the damage cannot be increased by any means. [48] +1 basic attack damage (adds to Ghost Shocker)"
talent,Fukura,Telle-Com,,,"Making use of some finicky epithet powers, Fukura can telepathically communicate with anyone she’s met. She does this by messing with that person’s memory so that they “remember” her speaking with them in a weird back and forth memory transfer. Afterwards both Fukura and the other person feel like their conversation happened some time in the past, despite the fact that they just had it."
talent,Fukura,Area Scan,,,"Immediately when entering any area, Fukura can quickly scan around, getting a general idea of the layout of the map and the positions of any people around. This scan is also technically always happening, meaning it’s basically impossible to sneak up on her."
talent,Fukura,The Sound of Your Demise,,,"When Fukura uses any of her abilities, they function as using both sound from her drums and direct control from her epithet. As a result, the effects of anything she does cannot be fully resisted or blocked unless the target is immune/resistant to both mental and sound effects."
passive,Fukura,The Campus,,,"Fukura doesn’t really like to get up close and personal in fights, and would generally rather stay back and support allies from a distance. During combat, Fukura generally stays in a manifestation of her epithet called “The Campus”, a large flying device that she controls by linking it directly to her brain. The Campus shares Fukura’s stamina, and more or less can move in any direction, though it can’t be more than 5 spaces above the ground during combat. The one caveat with The Campus is that in order for it to function properly, it must also be tangentially connected to the minds of Fukura’s allies, meaning that if all of her allies are knocked out then The Campus can’t continue to function, being immediately de-summoned. [32] Autonomous Functionality - Fukura rarely ever steps out of The Campus during combat mostly for her own safety, and normally if she’s not in it then it’s not there. However, with some of her power restored, Fukura can leave The Campus, allowing it to function mostly autonomously while she worries about other things. All normal rules still apply to The Campus, and it can only use Fukura’s basic attack and “I’ll Help You Out!”, however it’s action economy is separate from Fukura’s. Fukura and The Campus may not both use “I’ll Help You Out!” on the same turn. Finally, so long as Fukura is within 3 spaces of The Campus horizontally, as an anytime she can attempt to have it pull her back in to avoid an attack. **[Syn!]Campus 2.0** - Syn.AI.Bon and Fukura very obviously have several things in common and using his mechanical and engineering genius he was able to overhaul the ‘idea’ of the Campus and put the drums she had gotten into them! Don’t think about it, it’s fine! Anyways, this means Fukura can now play them while she is inside it. As a Once per combat free action she can play a rocking drum solo that inspires her allies, granting them the effect of “I’ll Help You Out!” without rolling or spending stamina. She cannot get the bonus action extension effect on this."
ability,Fukura,Observe,3,,"Fukura connects to a target’s brain and begins probing for some kind of weakness or exploitable function within the target’s memories, such as an emotional vulnerability, a leg injury, low upper body strength, etc. After finding it, she then connects that information directly to her allies' minds. This gives some kind of bonus effect to any attacks that exploit that weakness. This bonus effect could be something like a trip when attacking an opponent with a leg injury, a bonus overpowering someone with low muscle mass, a roll bonus if taking advantage of an emotional weakness, etc."
ability,Fukura,Cognitive Whiplash,1!,,"As an enemy attempts to perform an action, Fukura can quickly scan their mind and change their cognition to see their target as a person they absolutely wouldn’t want to use that effect on (for example, if performing an attack they may see the person they love, or if trying to heal an ally they may see the person as one of Fukura’s allies instead). The target may choose to attempt to power through their cognition, but they must make a resist roll that beats Fukura’s roll for this ability, and even on a success they’re faced with significant distress, giving them disadvantage on their next action. Once per round."
ability,Fukura,I’ll Help You Out!,2,,"Fukura adjusts her own neural pathways and pulses epithet waves out of The Campus to her allies within 3 spaces (horizontally), causing their brains to temporarily shift in the same way. This gives Fukura and her relevant allies one of three bonuses for the next round, chosen at random. 1: +2 damage. 2: +4 to rolls. 3: 2 DR. The effect wears off on allies after a round, but Fukura can choose to spend 1 stamina to pulse out another bonus on her next turn, chosen randomly again, without spending an action. This bonus effect can only happen once per ability usage, however. Using this ability outside of The Campus only lets it affect 1 ally and herself. [28] Pulse Shift: When using the bonus effect of “I’ll Help You Out!”, Fukura may spend an additional 2 stamina on top of the normal cost when using the bonus effect to stack the buffs on top of each other rather than replacing the old one. [40] Controlled Pulse: When using the bonus effect of “I’ll Help You Out!”, Fukura now rolls for the buff twice, choosing the option of the two that she wants."
ability,Fukura,Drum Beats,1,,"She may be a mere husk of her former self, but Fukura still remembers the days of her past, playing songs and crushing foes. Using a set of drums re-created from her memories, Fukura plays the beats signaling her enemy’s demise. Enemies that are hit by this take no damage, but all enemies close enough to hear its beating are made to feel pain more than they ever have, causing them to take 1.5x damage for a round (rounded up). The caveat for this is, unlike most of Fukura’s other attacks, this calculates range like normal, considering all dimensions, since it’s a wave of sound sending her power to her target’s minds."
ability,Fukura,Memory Probing,X,,"Fukura scans the recent memories of a target within 6 spaces (horizontally) and attempts to reproduce an effect or item from it. This can’t currently create things such as summons or reconstructions of people, but can produce various objects the target has seen, or even attempt to reproduce the effects of an ability or passive that the target has or otherwise has a significant understanding of. Only one once per combat ability may be reproduced per combat. This ability works significantly better on recent memories, and can’t effectively probe further back than the beginning of the current session. Cost is dependent on the effect produced."
weapon,Nicole,Shamrock,,,"After Nicole's evolution, she upgraded her beam blade and gave it a new name because of the lucky situation she found herself in and the green blade. It can additionally morph into mostly any other basic weapon. It deals 7 damage at 1 range. [21] Luck Of The Draw - In Nicole’s own words, ‘Shamrock feeds off of the subversion of fate and the pervasiveness of luck.’ What this actually translates into is the fact that whenever Nicole rolls a natural 20 or an otherwise REALLY useful and lucky result, she stores a ‘luck charge.’ Whenever she wants, Nicole can spend a charge to apply a random negative status effect to the target, a random positive status effect to herself, or a random table effect to either. She can only have up to 3 charges at a time, and they are purged at the end of session."
weapon,Nicole,Acoustic Guitar,,,"Nicole swings with her signature guitar at an enemy. Despite seemingly being made out of simple wood, the thing is virtually indestructible. Deals 7 damage at 1 range, with significant knockback!"
talent,Nicole,Gotta Jet,,,Nicole is a super cool and radical gal. You know what cool people do? Ride skateboards. Wanna know what cooler people do? Ride rocket-powered skateboards. Nicole has a rocket board that increases her movement by 1 and lets her hover up to 3 spaces off the ground.
talent,Nicole,Playback,,,"Dolos isn’t here anymore, so Nicole needed to get...creative. Effectively, Nicole brings one of the afterimages of someone in the past of the area into the present in order to interact with the area how they would or how they have in the past. In combat, Nicole can use this as a swift action specifically to have them interact with things in the combat arena or as a bonus action if it would deal damage. Pre-Recorded - Nicole can split Playback off from themselves as part of a move action to have it move to a different position. Whenever Nicole moves, Playback can move the same amount. At any time, she may teleport directly to Playback and un-split OR pay 1-5 stamina and have Playback completely copy the things they did during a turn(this must be rolled for and every action taken is treated as half effective.) Nicole can also use a bonus action to have Playback emulate another person she’s met in order to have them act how they would and perform tasks like they could. Nicole can keep this up basically forever so long as the emulation doesn't participate in any arduous activity like combat or something else, in which case Nicole will need to pay 1 upkeep to continue having it active."
talent,Nicole,Hidden Ability: Prankster,,,"Nicole's always got a little bit of mischief in her heart and hey, she likes Pokemon too, so why not? Prankster is an ability that allows Nicole to use a status move right before an enemy, making any status move an anytime action. Once per round."
talent,Nicole,Temporal Impact,,,Nicole can spend 2 stamina when she attacks to have her attacking action occur in the past. The attack in question is considered to be irreducible and cannot be reacted to. Keep track of how much damage these attacks deal to individual targets. This can be used thrice per combat. [100CD] Temporally Unstable - Nicole can spend 1 stamina before taking a damaging action to have her damage increased by the amount of total chronal damage divided by 50 rounding down. This damage is treated as chronal damage and counts towards Total Chronal Damage. This effect can only be triggered once per round.
passive,Nicole,Rememberance,,,"Nicole’s epithet allows her to have an incredible memory. She has retained every single memory that she has ever experienced that leads to her having the potential to be the single smartest person on the planet. If she is told about how a mundane technique is done, she may replicate it perfectly. The first time she uses it, it is the current version with all of the upgrades, with it having an additional cost equal to 1d(cost or upgrades, whichever is higher). Every future use of the technique is base or slightly worse depending on what she rolled. The other part of Nicole’s epithet allows her to view the past actions of people around her and see the world as it was in the past. She can go as far back as dinosaurs but anything past that strains her too much. Living things show up when she uses this sight but they are featureless and blank. [31] Right Tools for the Job - Nicole’s epithet can now replicate supernatural/technological elements of character in order to copy those kinds of techniques. [42] An Experiment Done Right. - Nicole is now treated as an expert mundie if she crits which can be split between her kit features as she desires. Setting Foundations - Nicole is able to pick 3 mundane techniques that she has copied that were not gained from ‘right tool for the job’ and is able to have those techniques be ingrained into Nicole's being. This means that if Nicole would lose her epithet/her memory she would still have access to those techniques. At the start of a session Nicole can choose one of these mundane techniques to give Nicole a physically based buff that doesn't have a bunch of mechanics/numerical buffs."
passive,Nicole,Cool Techs,,,If Nicole’s PC writes down all the Dual Techs that she performs with other PCs she is able to recreate them with the help of Playback. Playback morphs and is treated as the other PC for this dual tech. Nicole pays stamina for the entire Dual tech. Unlike her other abilities this is reproduced at full efficiency. This can only be triggered once per combat. (Dual techs from companionship count towards this list)
passive,Nicole,Contemporary Rivals,,,"At the start of combat choose an ally. You cannot go below 1 stamina until said ally goes below 1 stamina at least once this combat, including by stamina costs. However, neither of you can benefit nor support the other."
passive,Nicole,The Power of a Hundred Lifetimes,,,"Once per session you may spend 10 stamina additionally on an action and it instead rolls with a d100, scaled off the effectiveness of the d20 system. Rolling a natural 100 on this action gives it outclass priority and grants 10 max stamina."
passive,Nicole,If I’m Remembering Right…,,,"Using her epithet for the way it was meant to be used, Nicole is able to change people and put them into a state of how she remembers them. This changes their appearance/bodily function/red stat to be how she remembers them in the moment she is choosing. This does not affect stamina or proficiency. This passive can only affect one person during combat, and up to 3 others outside of combat. This only lasts for a week before fading. The other 3 are technically still in use but aren’t active if they are also in combat. "
passive,Nicole,Memory Lane,,,"Through physical contact, Nicole can learn other peoples' memories, with the most prevalent being those which are regarded fondly. She can learn any information from their memories, including how some of their mundane techniques work if they allow it. If she does copy the techniques this way, one of them can get a natural +1 to its use depending on how much of the person's memories she's seen(mostly GM and character discretion.) After she's used this on someone, she may use ‘Back To The Future’ to manifest an item or event from their memories with a cost decided upon by the GM and the character in question. Objects and events are usually temporary, but objects specifically can be made permanent once per session if Nicole reduces or gives up her next set of combat rewards, depending on how strong the item is. If she rolls a 15+ attack roll with a physically contacting move, she can get a brief flash of an important item or relatively well-regarded event from their past, but getting the information this way is weaker without repeated contact and cannot be made permanent. Additionally, she can let other people experience some of her own memories, being able to deliver the memories to any willing target within 15 spaces of her through any medium she wants, from finger guns to actual guns to idk a bazooka or somethin’ my dude."
ability,Nicole,Afterimage,2,,"Nicole generates an afterimage that follows her movements as long as they move 1 space, the afterimage follows a round behind her movement actions. If the afterimage collides with Nicole they dissipate into nothing. Nicole can spend her movement on their turn to have the after image use one of their actions or abilities on a target within his range. [11] Distorted Image - Nicole’s after image no longer fades away when coming into the same space as Nicole. Instead it shares the same space as Nicole and enemies targeting Nicole now have a -5 to hit."
ability,Nicole,Back to the Future,X,,"Nicole uses her past vision to do a complete analysis of an object that can at most take up a 2x2 space back to the future where she can use it properly. This can be anything that would appear in the past of the area that Nicole currently resides in. She then can pull said object into this future using their epithet. This creates a separate timeline without that object but Nicole doesn’t seem to know or care about that. Due to 2 exact copies of the same item existing in the same existence at the same time, time seems to glitch and the item brought to this reality only lasts 1d3+1 rounds. This can be used to copy weapons or items on a person but only 1 at a time. X is determined by the GM. [28] Withdrawal Towards The Present - Back to the future can now be used as a bonus action on Nicole’s turn at the cost of the item being brought back being a bit less effective than normal and only lasting 1d2 rounds instead of 1d3+1. A Look Back - Nicole can create a recreation of events that happened up to a week ago as if it were a complete recording of that event. There is no size limitation to this usage. The events play out entirely perfectly as they did in that time up until the completion point. Nicole can speed up, slow down, or stop this scene recreation whenever she wants to control the rate of how it goes and gather as much information as possible. Anything in the event can also interact with things that touch it, but people in the present cannot affect the event."
ability,Nicole,Pastforward,1!,,"When an ally succeeds in an attack or ability roll that is super cool and radical, Nicole can use her epithet to create an echo of their target repeating their ability at half efficiency. It might not be as cool as the original but the action of showing it off again is also pretty cool in its own right. This ability cannot be used to replicate once per combats, outclasses, and overclasses. [33] Here and Now - Pastforward can be used on a once per combat once per session. Also Choose one: Be able to pick two different actions that have happened within the turn instead of just one. [47] Have Past Forward be able to target any target within range of the original ability. This can be originating from the person of the original attack or Nicole herself."
ability,Nicole,Flashback,2!,,"When an attack comes towards Nicole, she thinks back to a time when there wasn’t an attack coming at her. She then forces her epithet to teleport her in a position she was in a round ago. [39] Thief Through Time - If Nicole would travel next to an enemy’s position in the past using this, Nicole can take any items or belongings from the enemy in question, this does not rewrite what the items have done, just simply puts them in her possession. Flashback also can be used on allies within 4 spaces of the original Nicole or adjacent to an afterimage."
ability,Nicole,Run it Back,X,,"Nicole targets an ally or herself and rewinds them back to a time in their past that Nicole would be able to see. Any abilities that were used that could theoretically be copied by Nicole’s passive are copied with no stamina costs or having to understand how they work. These are not permanent, though she can choose one to keep permanently at the end of combat, automatically fulfilling any requirements to use that ability/basic attack and removing the extra cost from her passive. If Nicole would like more than one technique she can choose to sacrifice an amount of her end of combat rewards at a rate of 1:1 for techniques. If the cost exceeds the amount of rewards, Nicole just does not get combat rewards for the combat. X is equal to 3 times the number of rounds Nicole would like to rewind someone back. If she targets herself the costs are applied after she uses the ability. This can be used to refresh Once per Combats but not outclasses or overclasses. Once per combat."
ability,Nicole,Nicole Energy Flow,,,"Extending a palm forward, Nicole lets loose an energy ball! Whoa! It's stance isn't very good though, so it only travels 2 spaces and deals 3-4 damage. The energy formed using this also has the properties of rubber and gum and can be used as NOT a ki blast."
ability,Nicole,Chronal Pull,65 - X [Minimum 5],,"If Nicole is adjacent to a space that an enemy started in, she can break the reality of time and reach through the vision that her epithet grants to grab an item. This brings the designated Item to the present and negates whatever the item has done to anyone affected by the item. Any buffs or negatives that are gained from the removal of said item from the combat are retroactively applied.. Some examples of this are as follows: If said item has dealt damage, half the damage dealt is healed. If an effect that gave out negatives and made rolls fail, some of those rolls retroactively succeed. Nicole’s PC will have to write down what the Item has done, if Nicole’s PC forgets certain actions that the item has done then that’s on Nicole's PC. X/50 per session. (Once Per Combat) Once per Data Bounty."
ability,Nicole,Let's See That One More Time,X+4⛯,,"Would you look at that, what a dope ass Turn. Let’s see that again. Nicole brings grey mirages of all characters that have acted on a specific turn within the last round and is able to direct their actions at targets once again. X is equal to half of the stamina costs on said turn (rounded down). All the actions that take place will be resolved as they were resolved on the turn in question and have the same rolls that they had on said turn. Any Crits that happen on the turn do not grant prof again no matter the circumstances, their damage and ‘critical effects’ can be dampened to what the effect typically does if the GM so desires. If anyone were to try and anytime the actions created by this ability, they roll at disadvantage. Nicole is only able to repeat turns that have happened within the past round. Dual techs and tri techs and ‘whatever techs’ for this ability are technically a part of the same turn. Once Per Combat."
weapon,Cadence,Bite the Dust!,,,"Her hand cloaked in an almost golden fire, Cadence lets loose a strike at a nearby target, leaving a burning indent where she lands. She can punch through thin objects like doors and such easily with a simple strike dealing 6 damage and inflicting 3 Tinder stacks to the target. She may use it at 2 range instead for 3 damage and 5 Tinder stacks, as a lick of flame escapes her hand and lashes a target of her choice. [30] Flickering Blow - +1 Damage (to 7/4). [33] Burning Down The House - Tinder inflicted set to 3 and 5"
weapon,Cadence,Jiaolong,,,"A Guan dao with a bright red handle that hasn’t faded through the ages. It has a glass dragon design that goes all the way to the blade, and has an opening near the very end...Fire could very easily be channeled through this. deals 7 damage at 2 range, which can be extended to 5 damage at 3 range if she stabs it. The blade itself isn’t very interesting, however along its edge, it can generate Water. At default, Cadence covers it in fire. It adds 6 Tinder stacks to any target it hits for the first time, and 3 Tinder afterwards."
talent,Cadence,Cold Fury,,,"While Hatred primarily ends up manifesting in a fiery, combustible way, it would be wise to not forget that it can be ice cold as well. If she pays 2 Stamina on top of the cost of any other ability, Cadence can enter Valkyrie state, changing her abilities into an icier mode! Manifesting icy wings as a sudden blizzard sets in, the flames she previously manifested turn into a horrific chill. After the attack is done, she follows up with a wing swipe in a 90 degree cone 2 spaces long that sweeps, dealing 3 damage and adding 2 additional Tinder stacks. As an unrolled twice-per-round anytime, she may shatter the wings in front of an attack to reduce the damage of an attack that passes within 2 spaces of her. [43] Shocking Temper - Cadence knows very well that the flavors of hatred come in many forms.... It can be burning and ferocious; a hot and steaming expression of fury that lashes out at any and pieces of fuel it can latch onto. It can be cold and bitter; an internalized well of emotion that inspires nothing more than a want to close yourself off and hide away from others. However… it can also be shocking and indiscriminate; a spectacle to behold affecting anyone and anything in its way until it's lust for wrath is fully quenched. Similarly to Valkyrie, Cadence may pay additional stamina on top of an ability she’s performing to enter Amazon state, adorning herself with plates of armor crafted from electrical energy. While in Amazon Cadence is incredibly resistant to status effects and debuffs and may roll to completely shrug off such things as a bonus action on her turn, and whenever Charges are expended she may immediately move an equal number of spaces. Amazon has an upkeep of one. You may not enter Amazon if you are in Valkyrie and vice-versa. [66] Galvanic Indignation - All Tinder spent during Amazon is now transferred into an equal amount of Charges. Cadence may choose for the armor granted by Amazon to grant her a temporary Stamina pool equal to double their passive Charge gain by increasing the upkeep by two. All damage dealt to Cadence is first dealt to the armor’s Stamina and this Stamina pool cannot be used to fuel abilities. Cadence may choose to expend Charges to restore its Stamina pool at the start of her turn, and only up to an amount she can generate at a time. Whenever her armor takes damage it counts as losing an equal amount of Charges."
talent,Cadence,Heat Flash,,,Feel that heat? The temperature slowly rising? It’s about to get a lot more toasty here soon! Cadence may choose to reduce any instance of damage she deals by half(rounded down) in order to apply that much additional tinder to a target she is attacking.
talent,Cadence,Inextinguishable,,,"Yours is a flame that will not easily die out… in fact it will only get stronger with every attempt. Cadence no longer falls unconscious when they fall below zero Stamina and still possess Tinder on the field. Whenever Cadence would be knocked unconscious or killed she may absorb all Tinder on the field and heal herself by an equal amount while gaining a number of benefits based on the amount of Tinder she absorbs… as she is cloaked in a burning aura that silhouettes her form. These effects only last until the end of combat though they do stack if she would trigger them additional times. 5 Tinder - Every five Tinder increases her movement speed by one. 10 Tinder - Every ten Tinder increases her damage by one. 15 Tinder - Every fifteen Tinder increases her damage reduction by one. 20 Tinder - Every twenty Tinder reduces her Stamina costs by one."
passive,Cadence,Fueling the Fire of a Burning Desire,,,"Fueling the Fire of a Burning Desire - All of Cadence’s attacks place Tinder stacks on the target, which she can exchange whenever she attacks for various benefits, listed here: 1 Tinder - The target’s next roll has a -1. This can be used multiple times. 2 Tinder - Fire begets Fire. The target now gains 1 tinder at the start of each of their turns until they put themselves out with water or something that can remove flames. This can be stacked. 3 Tinder - Gives a Burn debuff to the target that deals damage each time one of their turns begins, or when they attack. The GM decides when the burn status goes away usually. She may refresh (and add 1 to the damage) this status if she uses this Tinder effect again. 4 Tinder - The area directly adjacent to the target gets incinerated as it turns into a blasted heath. This causes every adjacent square to become difficult terrain, and everyone adjacent to take the triggering attack's damage. 5 Tinder - The attack deals +4 additional damage. 10 Tinder - Her attack has a +10 to hitting. If Cadence chooses to use Tinder stacks, the attack in question applies none. Tinder benefits must be exchanged before the attack is rolled. Multiple benefits can be selected, though no more of one type unless it says so. If the attack misses or fails, the tinder stacks are consumed nonetheless."
passive,Cadence,From A Loving Place,,,"Cadence, if she holds a hand to someone, can feel the emotions that they’re feeling, and vice versa. Emotional High - Cadence perpetually gets small bonuses depending on the mood of the combat. This means things like, if it’s an exciting or energetic fight she gets extra movement, if it’s a “I know you’re still in there” sort of deal she gets bonuses to convince, an intense fight may grant more tinder. It is a bonus that specifically aligns with the current ‘vibe’ of the combat."
passive,Cadence,Venting Wrath,,,"Cadence gains +2 movement and may spend points of movement at the start of her turn in order to slowly attempt to vent her rage. Waves of heat come off of her and quickly flow around those around her, giving the amount of movement spent in tinder to everyone within a (movement spent)/2 minimum 1 radius around her. She may only spend up to the movement given to her gained through proficiency with her epithet or ring kit."
passive,Cadence,This River Runs Deep,,,"You have learned to love… learned to share… and learned to be kind; compassionate. Now it is time for you to learn to hate; to truly despise someone. It is time for you to nurture your rage. Doesn’t it feel good to lay blame on someone else? Cadence may now gain Enmity. Enmity represents Cadence’s negative relationship with a target, in a similar manner to Companionship. The key difference is that instead of learning to better cooperate with the subject of her attention… she learns how to better take them down and those like them. Whenever Cadence receives Companionship she may instead choose to focus her anger on a target of her choice and increase their Enmity by an equal amount."
passive,Cadence,Battle Song (Ascendant Crescendo),,,"Whenever you succeed a roll, your next roll gets a +1. Should that succeed, the next roll retains the +1 with an additional +1 on top. This continues for as long as your rolls succeed, to a maximum of +5. At +5, your abilities get a 1.5x effect multiplier! Be careful though, as all your progress is lost upon failing a single roll of any kind."
passive,Cadence,Epitomized Senses,,,"For passing Ridbi's lesson with flying colors, Cadence's sensory capabilities have increased dramatically. She can see clear details from extremely far distances, as well as being able to see infrared and ultraviolet light. Her smell is way stronger than a bloodhound's, and her hearing is more accurate than an owl's. While these heightened senses can be easier to overload, Cadence can turn down or turn off any aspect of her passive. The switch can also happen in the middle of combat at any time, but Cadence must roll to do so with a buff or debuff of the GM's discretion within reason if it's in response to being attacked."
ability,Cadence,Five Alarm,1!,,"Cadence gains 3 charges of this ability at the start of combat and whenever her turn comes around. She simply charges 3 spaces in any direction, dealing 3 damage and inflicting 3 Tinder stacks onto a target. [40] I'm Just Getting Started! - +2 Charge generated per turn. [66] Living Battery - Your passive Charge gain is increased by one. 1 Charge - Relocate (costs 2 stamina, doesn’t deal damage nor inflict Tinder. Cannot be done with any other modifiers. Cannot be used to dodge incoming damage). 2 Charges - Use this ability as described. 1 Charge - Be able to use it again freely. 3 Charges - Able to deflect attacks she charges into. 2 Charges - Add +3 additional Tinder stacks onto the target. 3 Charges - Deals 5 damage instead. 30 Charges - Deals 25 damage instead, but ends her turn."
ability,Cadence,Scald-Step,2,,"As a free action on her turn, Cadence dashes quickly 2 spaces in any direction, hitting a target she passes adjacent to with a deft punch to an undefended location, piercing through DR and dealing 3 damage as it makes a notable break in the location, and inflicting 2 Tinder stacks, 3 on high rolls."
ability,Cadence,Let's See The Sparks,3,,"Cadence raises a hand as a fiery spear is manifested, before it seems to solidify somewhat. Still burning hot, but it has a defined shape. Perfect for purging monsters from this world, in any context. She stabs it into a target of her choice for 5 damage to start, dealing +2 damage for each 2 Tinder stacks on the target and consuming all of them, giving her Charge equal to half of the Tinder stacks consumed. She may keep this weapon out for 2 Upkeep cost. It’s a 6 damage weapon at 3 range that gives +4 Tinder stacks to the attacked target. This becomes +5 if she attacks at 3 range. [21] Fuel for the Flames - Let’s See The Sparks can pierce in a line up to 3 spaces away (in the same direction attacked from) for its default damage and consuming no Tinder on any target past the first. This piercing strike applies ¼ of the tinder spent to the targets and she may leave the flaming spear manifested within the targets in order to leave them stuck together until they pull it out."
ability,Cadence,Wall of Spite,2,,"Cadence takes in a breath before making a cross motion and snapping her fingers, a wall of ki and flame with a large cross within the center appears within 4 spaces of her. If this is summoned under someone, they may take a single space of movement to move out of the way before it is summoned. The wall is considered physical for everything except for allied attacks/effects and is 5 spaces long and tall while being one space thick. This wall can move one space in a predetermined direction of her choice every 3 turns on initiative, pushing anything it moves into along with it. Enemies that touch the wall take 2 damage and 4 tinder the first time they do so in a round, with each time after only dealing 1 damage and 2 tinder. Walls of Spite fade within 3 rounds or upon taking 10 damage at once, at which point the damage will shatter it but the attack that produced it will not pass through. [33] Burning Down The House - Cadence's basic attacks, Five Alarm, Scald Step and Wall of Spite all inflict +1 Tinder stacks. (to 4/2)"
ability,Cadence,Declaration of Disdain,2,,"Cadence growls as she looks at someone on the battlefield, the heat from her wrath warbling the air around them. She raises a hand to them and violently closes it, dragging the heat from their body into herself as she mulls over the thing she loathes the most about that person. She may spend any amount of tinder on a target in order to gain an equivalent buff or buffs based on something she hates about them. Typically, the buffs will last about 2-3 rounds, but it can last for shorter or longer based on the buff, the roll and the amount of tinder spent. She may pay an additional two stamina to use this as a bonus action."
ability,Cadence,Cold Trailing,1,,"Cadence gains Charges of this ability as per Five Alarm. A fierce rumbling overtakes the area as mounds of lexical snow form around Cadence. With a swift motion, she dashes forward as the snow spreads out, forming an avalanche-like effect all around her! Cadence dashes up to 4 spaces in a straight line and leaves behind a powder-y blue snow in every space adjacent to her during this. If this snow touches someone, they gain 1d4+1 tinder upon first contact or upon starting their turn in it. This can dodge things and knock foes off balance. 1 Charge - Cadence simply places a 3x3 of snow around her without doing the movement. Cannot be used with other modifiers.1 Charge - Cadence does the dash but only leaves the snow on the spaces they pass over. Cannot be used with other modifiers. 2 Charges - Use this ability as described. 2 Charges - Cadence can move up to her full movement and doesn’t need to go straight. She can spend the stamina again up to twice more in order to perform an additional dash at the base movement. 3 Charges - The initial d4 for tinder is exploding. 3 Charges - Cadence can use this with advantage. Can be picked up to twice. 30 Charges - A veritable avalanche of snow covers a 10 space radius around Cadence, stopping any actions in their tracks and coating all of the spaces in that range with her snow."
ability,Cadence,Sorbet Shot,1,,"As a free action, Cadence fires out a spike of ice at a target, sidestepping 1 space in any direction. This has 4 range and deals 3 damage. If it succeeds, she may use it again up to two times. When the attack is used, Cadence can spend Tinder stacks for new effects: 1 Tinder: Cadence’s next roll has a +2 (can only be stacked once.) 2 Tinder: The next ally to use a basic attack on the target has advantage. 2 Tinder: One of Cadence’s wings is regenerated, and it reduces an attack by 3 damage instead. 3 Tinder: Cadence dashes up to the target instead. 5 Tinder: Cadence creates a massive spike of ice underneath the target instead, locking them in an icy prison for a bit and dealing 2 extra damage. It’s easy enough to break out, but if they don’t break out before her next turn, it acts as though they have 10 Extra Tinder Stacks and if she uses Five Alarm on the target, she may act as though she has 10 free charges on them specifically. 10 Tinder: Once per Session, Cadence’s wings both regenerate and roar to life as everywhere around her drops to freezing temperatures. She makes another spear, this one made of ice. Any ice prisons shatter into shrapnel dealing 5 damage to everyone adjacent and their prisoner. Cadence now has +2 movement and can fly freely, anyone adjacent to her takes 1 damage and gain 3 Tinder stacks on her turn as there’s a vortex of wind that surrounds her. At this point, rage is all that she can feel."
ability,Cadence,Comet Fall,3,,"Cadence forms a massive shield of ice in her right hand, her epithet’s energy coalescing into it fully. She then takes a mighty leap into the sky, shattering through any barriers in her way, going so high she almost can’t be seen! She then streaks down in any space she chooses, shield first, smashing anyone in that space for 8 damage and 6 tinder and dealing half that in a 5 space radius as ice spikes and snow grow from the crater and spike outwards, creating a tumultuous tundra! Every 2 spaces a target moves within this tundra gives them an additional stack of tinder. She may keep the shield out for 2 Upkeep cost. It’s a 6 damage weapon at 1 range that takes 2 tinder stacks away from a target and gives Cadence 3 charges in return. She may choose to throw this shield up to 4 spaces away, reducing it’s damage to 3. The shield will always bounce back to her or remanifest in her hands. [21] Frozen Over - The radius of the attack grows by two spaces, but only for determining how far the tundra reaches."
ability,Cadence,Glacial Drift,3,,"Cadence stomps the ground as a 3x3 glacial wall erupts from the ground up to 3 spaces away. This glacial wall doesn’t melt under any stimuli and is extremely hard to break. Anyone Cadence chooses who touches the glacier gains 1d2 tinder and is partially stuck to it, requiring a small part of a movement action to escape. However, at the start of Cadence’s turn, she may move the Glacier’s dimensions 2 spaces in any direction and can spend Tinder from people who are within 3 spaces of it in order to apply an effect. The Glacier does not go away on it’s own, but has an effective stamina of 30. The Glacier counts as an ‘ice prison’ for Sorbet Shot. 1 Tinder - Increase the die size of applied tinder by 1. 2 Tinder - Targets stuck to the glacier now need to use half of their movement to get free. 2 Tinder - The Glacier grows out two more spaces in any direction. 3 Tinder - The Glacier heals 1d10!+3 Stamina. 5 Tinder - The Glacier grows spikes, dealing 1d6+2 damage to anyone already stuck to the glacier and dealing 1d4+2 damage to anyone knocked into it in the future."
ability,Cadence,Heart of Cold,2,,"Cadence wordlessly stares at a target who has tinder on them, her ice-blue eyes seeming to pierce their very soul. She snaps her fingers as black ice spikes out from their body, stabbing into them and slowly filling them with a freezing spite. Cadence purges as much Tinder as she would like from that target in order to apply a 1dX(X being the amount of purged tinder) damage over time along with a corresponding debuff which is in line with what a target either hates most about themselves or what they hate the most about others. This is resistable, but a free action will only ever reduce the die size by 1-2, with the debuff fully going away once it would effectively be a d0."
ability,Cadence,Heat Flux,1!,,"Cadence gains Charges of this ability as per Five Alarm. Cadence shrugs off incoming hostility and lashes out. She greatly reduces the effect through sheer force of will and causes anime lightning to bounce toward the origin of the effect, dealing backlash damage equal to its Stamina cost or three, whichever is higher. Once per Round. 1 Charge - Use this ability without backlash damage. Cannot be used with other modifiers. 2 Charges - This effect now lasts for the remainder of the turn and may be used again. 2 Charges - This effect now generates an amount of Tinder equal to the backlash damage. 3 Charges - Use ability as described. 3 Charges - This effect now reflects what is reduced but changes its effect to be partially electrically aligned. 5 Charges - Cadence now gains some sort of strength or boon from the reduced effect which lasts for one round after it is absorbed or until the end of her next turn although she may spend 1 Charge to extend its life time by one round. 30 Charges - Cadence is hyper charged as a bolt of lightning strikes them. She completely absorbs the triggering effect into Charges and may spend Charges to increase any numerical values within her sheet at a one-to-one rate until the end of her next turn. She cannot extend this effect."
ability,Cadence,Flash Step,3,,"As a free action, Cadence reels back before disappearing with a flash of lightning, appearing next to a target within her movement range without any indication and performing a palm strike. This strike sends the target flying back 7 spaces and applying them with 4 stacks of shock along with 3 tinder. This is generically very hard to react to due to the speed of the technique. Cadence can spend charges on this in order to increase the knockback or get an ‘end-step’ effect at a 1:1 rate."
ability,Cadence,Crash of Thunder,3,,"Cadence enters a defensive stance and manifests a large axe made of lightning, with it crackling and buzzing menacingly. Once something catches her eye and it seems like the right time to strike, she may dash up to her current amount of charges in spaces away before releasing a whirling slash, dealing damage to all enemies in a 5 space long 180 degree cone equal to their tinder or 6, whichever is higher. This attack instantly paralyzes all targets it hits, meaning they cannot take out of turn actions such as anytimes for 3 turns. Cadence gains 1 charge for every target struck by this. This ability can only be used as a readied action. If she wants to hold it in response to an attack this ability will be heavily telegraphed, and she may only hold it for specifically one person’s attack, though their summons count as them should they attempt to loophole it that way. If this is triggered by an attack, this ability’s activation (regardless of success or failure) will cancel the attack, though this ability’s damage is reduced by half for that instance. Cadence may pay 2 upkeep in order to keep the Axe, with it being a 6 damage 2 range melee weapon which applies 3 tinder on hit. Cadence may spend 2 charges while using this in order to move while acting with it. She may also spend 3 charges to perform a spin-slash attack, dealing its damage to all targets within 2 spaces of her. [21] Sparking Abjuration - Cadence can choose to deal no damage in order to 'charge' all targets struck. Charged targets will gain a +3 to rolls, but Cadence may choose to roll whenever they would perform an offensive action against her allies to spend the charge, locking them in place and reducing the effectiveness of or fully cancelling that action."
ability,Cadence,Lightning Blockade,2,,"Cadence raises a hand to the sky before thrusting it downward, creating 5 separated lexical storm clouds within 6 spaces of her which call down a constant beam of lightning. These beams can be passed through, but moving through them will grant 3 stacks of shock and 1d2! Tinder. Cadence can, at the start of her turn, move the storm clouds 3 spaces through anywhere there isn’t an occupied space. Cadence may additionally travel up to the cloud and hop between them as only one space of movement so long as she is adjacent to or under the beam of lightning. 1 upkeep. Cadence may spend 5 charges at the start of her turn in order to increase a lightning cloud’s size category by one, to a max of 3x3. Cadence’s upkeep becomes equal to the highest size category among her clouds."
ability,Cadence,Electric Atmosphere,2,,"Cadence lets out a loud, boisterous shout as the atmosphere gets more and more intense, the entire field growing an electric air to it. Cadence may, as a bonus action purge up to half of her charges, giving everyone on the field but her a movement bonus equal to that and the ability to use their movement out of turn as an anytime to dodge things, though needing to use roughly 50% or more of the attack’s damage in movement to try, with more movement put in afterwards helping. However, anyone who moves while this is active gains tinder stacks equal to the movement used. On top of this, Cadence may use her own movement while this is active to try and interpose and block an attack for any allies within a radius of her equal to half of her base movement. This effect lasts until the end of Cadence’s next turn. Recharge 5-6 on a d6."
weapon,Daz,"The ""IRS""",,,"5 Damage 1 Range. Ha lmao, not really, but wouldn't it be funny though? A switchblade that Daz pulls from one of his coat pockets! It has blue rose patterns which slowly turn red with extended use! When he hits an attack using it, he gains 50 dollars."
talent,Daz,"“So Anyways, I Used The Money To Buy A Lamborghini.”",,,"So yeah while I was making the thing I may have spent a bit of the money I raised to buy something I really wanted and now like I have it but uhhhh... oops! The thing I’m making probably isn’t gonna be as good! Don’t worry though, I got a really useful item with all the money I was given! Or even like, multiple items! Whatever works, my guys. However, I can only do this once per combat. Don’t wanna make my investors pull out on anything I got goin’ on."
passive,Daz,Everyone! Lend Me Your Money!,,,"Daz’s epithet allows him to do quite a few things-- so long as he’s got the money for it! At the start of the combat, he brings up the idea for an ability, passive, talent, or even a neat invention and people around the combat can pay him to make it. He generally accepts money, but in the event someone can’t pay, his epithet can exchange 1 point of stamina into 10 dollars, and 1 point of *max* stamina into 100 dollars! As a free action on anyone’s turns, they can pay for him to make the feature and the money teleports into Daz’s hands for his use. Daz can spend a main action to make the feature and spend as much money as he wants to influence how strong it can be at maximum, with him needing to spend 300 dollars at minimum. At the start of his next turn, the feature becomes instated and anyone who paid for the feature he made has access to it. The first time a natural 20 is rolled to use the kit feature in a combat, Daz gains 1 proficiency! The kit feature disappears at the end of the session, but if Daz pays 500 dollars from the total he’s collected before making it, he can keep it for himself."
passive,Daz,Kick-starter? I Hardly Know Her!,,,"Gettin the funding for these incredible inventions is a real slog. Maybe if I spend a liiittle bit of money to kick-start myself or my ~wonderful~ investors it’ll go faster in the long term, don’t ya agree? At the start of combat Daz can take any money he’s accrued, or offer to take some money from his allies immediately (but only for this specific purpose), and spend it to raise or lower a turn on the initiative; at the cost of 50 dollars per spot. Of course, Daz takes a commission for this service, 10 dollars per move. Ka-ching! Daz may do this during combat as a move action."
ability,Daz,No Touching My Merchandise!,2!,,"In response to an action occurring within 6 spaces of him, Daz chastises the user and convinces them that the inconvenience it would cause him would DEFINITELY need to be paid for! They have the choice of either not performing the action and refunding the cost or being forced to give Daz money equal to 50 times the cost of the action they used or, if it has no cost, the highest numeric value that action would have(1 at minimum, 7 at maximum). This CAN make someone go into debt(either in monetary value or by choosing to go into negative stamina). Money given to Daz in this way does not count towards paying for what he’s making with his passive. Once per round."
ability,Daz,I’ll Subscribe To That.,2,,"Because of the pure spirit of his epithet, Daz can fund some of the other people around him! With a snap of his fingers, a surge of power(and wealth!) flows through an ally within 8 spaces, granting them a buff of his choice for 2 rounds! For every 50 dollars he funnels into the ally, he can either add another buff, increase the effectiveness of the original buff, or increase the duration of the buff by 1 round. If the person with this on them targets Daz with a harmful ability, they immediately take the opposite effects of each buff given to them for the rest of this ability’s duration. Additionally, every time the person makes use of the buff in any way, he gains 25 dollars back! "
ability,Daz,Giving Back To The Community,3⛯,,"Daz is so tired he literally cannot be fucking bothered to do anything. Hey, you. I’m gonna let you make up a new ability. You get to use it immediately when your turn rolls around and you can keep it until the end of combat. Like, once per combat or something. Oh also every time the ability is used, Daz gets 25 dollars for every stamina spent to use it."
weapon,Myka,Shroom Staff,,,"4 Damage, 3 Range. Myka’s staff, which seems to be a wooden crook with mushrooms growing all over it with a large cap growing on the top as well! There are tendrils coming from Myka’s arm which wrap around the staff, which they use to extend its reach further.[20] Weapon Upgrade, +1 Range(up to 4)"
talent,Myka,Mycelium Circuit,,,"Little known mushroom trade secret, all of the mushrooms in the world are connected by a special sort of layer of mushrooms called the mycelium circuit! This circuit usually flows to people with similar energies to Myka, and helps them learn about them! Myka starts a session rolling a d(however many characters Rosche has) and then a d(however much stuff is in their kit), getting 1d3 uses of that kit component which disappears by the end of a session. This list excludes any features that require more than itself to function."
passive,Myka,Parasitic Study Habits,,,"Myka can infect a target within basic attack range with a spore as a bonus action once every 2 rounds. These spores can be attacked as if they were Myka, dealing half of the attack’s damage to them, but cannot be removed unless Myka does so. The spores are immune to AOE damage. At the start of the target’s turn, the spores take over parts of their body further, dealing 1+(1 every other turn of theirs) damage. The bonus damage, when it would tick up, ticks up before the target takes the damage. This damage stops if Myka or the target get knocked out or killed. Myka can remove the spores from someone as a bonus action, rolling dice equal to the spore’s bonus damage to see what parts of their kit Myka gets. They get versions of the rolled things temporarily, with an amount of uses equal to the bonus damage. Cram Sesh - Myka instead gets double uses of basic weapons and ‘uses’ of passives or talents apply for the whole of a combat rather than just once per triggering it. They can only have 1 passive and 1 talent set to act this way per combat. [24] Wild Growth - Myka may spend uses of their copied things as free actions on their turn, without actually activating their effects. Doing so either increases Myka’s basic attack range for that round at a 1:1 ratio, or heals her for 1."
passive,Myka,Mushroom Immunity!,,,"Myka takes no negative effects from mushrooms or their spores! If another character has a mushroom gimmick, however, this doesn’t apply."
passive,Myka,Soul Protect,,,Myka has a shield around their soul at all times. This allows them to protect their soul from damage or negative effects. Additionally it stops other people from discovering their true nature as a Witch.
ability,Myka,Mycelium Clutch,1!,,"In response to an attack, The grey tendrils around Myka’s arm quickly branch out to catch and reduce the damage to at least half or below. If the attacker is within their basic attack range, they are infected by a spore from Myka’s passive. Once per round, however, the second effect is once per three rounds after it succeeds. If the attacker is already infected, it ticks up the bonus damage by 1."
ability,Myka,Singing Spores…~,2,,"Can’t you hear the beautiful songs? Myka smiles as spores spew from their hat in a 2 space area around them. These spores stay in that area for 2 rounds and within that area any enemy that was either caught in the original blast area or ends their turn in it takes 3 damage and starts hallucinating. When they hallucinate, they cannot accurately tell who anyone around them is and must roll 1d3 for every non-summon in the combat aside from themselves. On a 1, they see that person as an enemy, on a 2, they see that person as whatever they were to them, and on a 3, they consider that person an ally. The hallucinating unit is counted as willing for any effect that requires that to be used on them. If an enemy is infected by Myka’s passive, this affects them for the whole round, otherwise it runs out after they do an action. [30] Targets who are unwillingly forced into the Singing Spores cloud take its effects immediately. Can’t trigger this way on the same target more than once per round."
ability,Myka,"Have Some Fun, Fella!",3,,"Myka smiles at a target within 5 spaces of them before some of the tendrils that come out of her hat burst spores at them. That target and anyone adjacent to them immediately starts to have mycelium tendrils grow out of them. This deals 5 damage to them and allows Myka to use abilities from their space, however, the people affected can use a bonus action to try to remove these tendrils. (Unless they are infected by Myka’s passive, which means they must use a main action to remove it.)"
ability,Myka,"Don’t Mind Me, I’m Just Taking Over Your Brain!~",5⛯,,"Myka picks up to three targets they’ve infected with their passive before deciding to launch a vicious attack on their brain. This deals 6-9 damage to all targets, and causes them all to either basic attack any target of Myka’s choice within range or use a 2(or less) cost ability that does not have a usage limitation(like once per round or combat, etc) for free on a target of Myka’s choice, whichever Myka wants more. Once per combat."
ability,Myka,"That One’s Mine Now, Look!",1,,"Myka points to a target who has been affected by her passive before they move their arm, forcing that target to move up to 6 spaces in a way that Myka chooses. At any point before, during, or after the move, Myka can make the target perform a basic attack on someone of their choice. This basic attack deals halved damage if used to attack themselves."
weapon,Andy,Axe,,,5 Damage 1 Range. Applies 1d3 bleed on a 15+ hit.
weapon,Andy,Shotgun,,,3 Damage 3 Range (Cone). Reduces physical DR by 1 on hit.
weapon,Andy,Rip AND Tear Into Em!,,,"Sure, physical pain is hilarious, but EMOTIONAL pain is even more so! After Andy successfully damages someone, he may use this as a swift action to pull out a microphone and roast someone. This does 2d4 emotional damage based on how scathing the roast is in combination with the roll. A 15+ on this means everyone nearby is forced to laugh at them, giving them stacks of Humiliated for half of the damage they took. Humiliated reduces a target’s rolls by 1 per stack and are reduced by 1 every time the target rolls."
talent,Andy,AND Then Some!,,,"When Andy uses an action, Andy may do another action that would be considered complementary to that. I.E. using another weapon from a pair of weapons, digging a hole AND throwing someone in, grabbing someone AND throwing them to the ground and so on."
talent,Andy,AND Without Further Ado…!,,,"If something takes time to happen like an ability or a situational effect that happens after a set time limit, Andy can comment on how it’s taking a while to happen and roll a d20 to make it happen immediately depending on if his roll succeeds or not. If DMs think this would break something, it could alternatively just bring the subject of this a step closer to happening."
talent,Andy,Die AND Die Again!,,,"Despite what you may think, this isn’t that menacing of an upgrade! Whenever Andy crits, for his next 3 rolls he rolls two d20s and adds the total together to get the natural result. This doesn't force crits unless either of the dice naturally rolls within his crit range, but things are majorly boosted in effectiveness when going over 20. For each natural crit rolled with this, Andy gains a proficiency. If Andy rolls two 20s on a roll with this, it's a 4x crit."
talent,Andy,And A One And A Two,,,All of the dice Andy rolls that are positive to do so explode. This is due to rolling a die...and then another die...and then another. Dice can explode a maximum of 2 times. [C&B] AND A Three! - Andy’s rolls now explode on the maximum die size AND the one below it! They can also explode…infinitely.
talent,Andy,Props Ta Me!,,,"Andy can pull out any kind of item from a hypothetical hammerspace, with it half being made of epithet energy and half a real item. These items, if used as basic weapons, typically have the basic stats of his axe with either a +1 to damage or a +1 to range, with a minor side-effect. Andy may also use this to bring out a manifestation of any item he’s held or used before, though not necessarily as helpful."
passive,Andy,AND--!,,,"Once per round, Andy can invoke this passive to take another action! This specifically isn’t counted as an anytime but may act like one in terms of interrupting things.

Andy may additionally ferry AND-- actions to other people freely. If he does so, he will heal for any costs taken by the person using those actions.[C&B] Gaining Royalties - For anyone who uses an AND-- action like this, Andy will take credit for what they do! This means that the person AND Andy will gain any benefits from the action being taken if there are any!"
passive,Andy,AND DON’T YOU FORGET IT!,,,"Things that Andy says are utterly unforgettable. It’s always classic. That one joke you heard from him a looong time ago? Timeless! This can come in many forms, including but not limited to: Professor Oak Style words coming to mind, the voiceover helpfully reading a letter out to a cartoon character, or Andy being directly next to you repeating what he said just for you before disappearing out of the corner of your eyes."
passive,Andy,Checks AND Unbalances,,,"Y’see, bein’ that my word is AND and all, I figure why not get an upgrade…and then another upgrade? Andy can now spend an amount of proficiency equal to the proficiency they got an upgrade at divided by 10(rounded up) in order to get another upgrade in that slot. This can be an upgrade to that upgrade or an entirely new thing, whatever he feels. He can also do this multiple times to the same slot, but the price doubles each time."
ability,Andy,Give AND Take!,2,,"When Andy uses this, he reaches towards someone and steals something from them, this can be literal or conceptual. Andy then applies this to either himself or someone else within 3 spaces of him. This is most notably used for life-steal, which allows him to deal 6 damage and be able to divvy that much out as healing."
ability,Andy,"Yes, AND?! ",3!,,"Andy does finger guns to a person within sight range as a green glow overtakes them. They feel a supernatural alacrity and are compelled to do something! That person is allowed to take an action immediately. Once per round. [47] With Vim AND Vigor! - People roll their Yes, AND action with advantage! Additionally, they may ignore up to three cost when taking their Yes, AND action(including X costs you set yourself)"
ability,Andy,This AND That!,1,,"Andy grins and snaps their fingers as a pair of objects within 6 spaces of him take on a green glow. The objects then snap together, meeting at whatever point Andy desires and fusing together. This lasts for 10 rounds or until Andy dismisses the effect. [4] This AND...That Over There! - The range limit on This AND That is removed and otherwise considered to be sight or anything he’s seen within the current situation."
ability,Andy,AND Then This Happens!,X!,,"After an action resolves, he can take narrative control of the world for a moment and add on an effect or narrative consequence that occurs as a result of the action. This can be something like adding a bleed effect or causing big structural damage for a big sword swing attack or like, idk, a hole to the center of the Earth being made by a 1xinfinite beam laser attack. Mileage may vary. X is decided by GM but has a max of 5. Once per round."
ability,Andy,AND Again!,3!⛯,,"Andy raises his hand and coats himself almost entirely in a green glow to roll another initiative, taking a seperate turn on that initiative. Any once per round abilities refresh on that turn as well as on his original turn. Andy pays 2 upkeep on both of those turns. Once per Combat."
weapon,Dylaxaphi,I’m Sure You Won’t Mind if I Borrow it For a Bit!,,,"Dylaxaphi doesn’t really...Have a weapon. Instead of her usual weapon, she simply wields whatever the host's weapon is. [SK] I've used a lot of people using Weapons - When she first attaches to a host Dylaxaphi may spend 2 stamina and roll a random previous host of hers and apply properties of their basic attack to her host's basic attack. (she chooses one if there are multiple). Adding effects/damage types are easy but numerical stat buffs already on the attack cannot exceed +2 total. [60] The Term Basic Is So…. Unappealing - Dylaxaphi’s Host’s Weapons are now Referred to as Advanced Attacks, so long as they pay upwards of 3 stamina when using them. When doing so you may add additional effects based on your host’s powers/shadowrealm powers, but must spend another 2 stamina to apply those bonuses to other things that specify the usage/augmentation of basic attacks (e.x. Johnny’s ORA ORA ORA or Donovan’s Streaming Leaf Art, etc). Mechanics that specifically counter/augment basic attacks from an outside effect do not work on Advanced Attacks."
talent,Dylaxaphi,Shared Knowledge,,,"Dylaxaphi is all for having a beneficial relationship for both her and her host! Any critical success rolled by her or her host that would grant proficiency gives the other 1 proficiency. [41] (It Was MY Idea After All) - When you gain proficiency from a nat crit and if your host gains an upgrade from it you may add a somewhat weaker version of it to your kit, I mean, you gave it to them after all, and may use it across hosts. [72] Optimized Puppetry - You now naturally crit on 19s using your host's skills, if using their basic attack this does not reset any potentially accrued roll bonus. Critting in this manner gives proficiency."
talent,Dylaxaphi,Infinite Mental Void,,,"Dylaxaphi deep-diving into the brain of the imagination guy has given her a bit more power in the maneuvering through people's mindscapes, and warping the inside of them! Dylaxaphi and her host have slight resistance against mental effects. Should she wish to extend it."
passive,Dylaxaphi,It's Symbiotic!,,,"Dylaxaphi doesn’t have a form by themselves, instead forcing themselves to possess someone at the start of the match. If they don’t accept her possession, she gets an unignorable compulsion to switch hosts. She wants to give incentives for them going along with it though, so they get a bunch of benefits as well! A few important notes - Dylaxaphi gains the kit of whoever she is possessing, able to use their abilities. Dylaxaphi adds her max stamina to the host, however is knocked out along with them if she’s still there. Dylaxaphi, on her turn, can move her host. Whenever Dylaxaphi uses an ability, it’s taken away from the Hosts health. If Dylaxaphi switches hosts, the total damage taken is halved and split between her stamina and the previous host's stamina. This will not exceed half the max stamina of the one who has less max stamina though, unless it would knock the other party out, in which case Dylaxaphi persists with 1 minimum. [52] I’ll Rest When You’re Dead - You no longer are knocked unconscious when your host is unconscious, but if they were to die you still die as well, you cannot spend costs while the host is unconscious. If Dylaxaphi somehow manages to swap hosts during this time, they will take the amount of damage Dylaxaphi has under 1. [15] Work on your Fucking [Movement] Speed! - Your hosts move speed is increased by one amongst your other passive effects. [37] Your Host’s movement speed is increased by two instead of one. [28] I Miss YOUR Ex-Wife, But Our Aim Is Getting Better! - When you are wielding your host's weapon, it gains +1 to damage. And when the host uses it, they get a +2 to the roll as you help them a little bit with their aim. [45] BUT OUR AIM IS GETTING BETTER - Whenever you or your host miss a basic attack (due to actually missing or by getting dodged) you both gain a +2 to the roll of any further attacks, this only resets when you switch hosts or critically succeed a basic attack."
passive,Dylaxaphi,"Single Brain Cell, Single Skin Cell",,,"Dylaxaphi can now manifest outside of the shadowrealm/mindscapes physically! As both her movement and bonus actions combined, she can leave a host body by coalescing their shadow into a body, which then becomes self-sustaining. While in this state she gains the following basic attack and other relevant kit changes; Shadow Squidgel - Dylaxaphi goops one of her arms into a serrated edge and then cuts into a target, 2 range 5 damage 1 LC Bleed. She has 6 movement speed, and 2 DR against light based damage. For the sake of if it matters she is considered a single-cell organism. She can be put under the effects of Dark Evolution, but they cannot be made permanent. Dylaxaphi counts as ""her own host"" for any things which would reference it, aside from The Pandora Passive and ""work on your adaptive capacity""."
passive,Dylaxaphi,I Don't Know What I'm Calling This to Be Honest. Uhhhhhhh Yeah I Got Nothing ,,,"Dylaxaphi's host feels a great surge of pain as she concentrates her power over their body and mind before forming a small physical body of herself in connection to their body. The pain of this process does 5 damage to the host (which is specifically not tracked for the sake of when they might split later). While this is active Dylaxaphi may spend 3 stamina to use a host's main action as if it were a bonus action, or 6 stamina to make it a once per turn free action. This lasts for 2 rounds as she loses a lot of her stored mental energy afterwards and is just incredibly exhausted. her share of the stamina pool is set to 3, unless it would be lower. She can also only do this once per session."
ability,Dylaxaphi,Work on Your Fucking Reaction Speed!,2!,,"Dylaxaphi, upon either a failed roll of her Host or an attack at her Host, violently takes control of the body and forces them to either dodge or roll the thing herself. [21] Full Motor Control - Reaction Speed is now a 1 cost. [43] Nervous System Integration - Reaction Speed is now Twice per Round. [76] Work on Your Adaptive Capacity - The host may now use “Reaction Speed” as a once per round for 2 stamina to try and force a reroll of something Dylaxaphi would be doing, this cannot be used to dodge, only as a reroll."
ability,Dylaxaphi,Repossession Notice,1,,"Dylaxaphi’s methods of moving around is...Quite odd. Once per two rounds as a move action, she can possess a willing ally within 4 spaces of her current host. If she does this to an ally, it functions as though the host was switched. She always gets the above ability so she can switch hosts if required, however if she functionally takes the ability, she gets an upgrade... "
ability,Dylaxaphi,Host-ile Takeover,3,,"Dylaxaphi can also use this on opponents! Functionally, she may control them on her turn, however just the same she’s knocked out. When used against bosses, she can override the requirement to move again for a few rounds depending on the roll. Any ability the boss has used, she can use too. She can use their basic attack without needing to look, and inflict the boss pain without her being hurt as well (a win/win scenario really). This being said, of course, she still has to relocate when the time is up, and takes stamina cost (not the boss) when she uses abilities. This makes the next host get less health, depending on the costs used. This is a Once per Combat when used against a boss, however she can be passed around from mook to mook. [17] Listen, Pal, You’re On THIS TEAM Now - While you control a mook/summon as your passive host (likely through Hostile Takeover) they take their actions as an ally instead of an enemy on their turn. [31] Shadowrealm Merger - Hostile Takeover costs one stamina when used on a mook and is a free action. [67] Hivemind - If she should wish, Dylaxaphi may split herself into fragments and operate under multiple host bodies, however there are multiple restrictions in doing so, particularly that for each split of dylaxaphi the max stamina that is granted to her hosts is divided amongst the various instances of herself, rounding down. Also, any mechanics besides her basic attack and primary passive must be decided on which instance of herself has, and should her host die with her in it, that instance of her mechanics is lost to the ether. You cannot split up Reactions speed’s per round usages, it must be the full anytime and the same basic concept applies to the rest of her mechanics."
ability,Dylaxaphi,SuperMinds,3,,"Superpowered and New Minds combine into one ability and the ability she creates when making a new one has advantage on its first use due to the power she draws from them in the power exchange, and has a +1 afterwards. [SK] W-ords W-ords W-ords - When using this ability you may choose to spend an additional stamina and instead roll a random word instead of the host's word to develop your new ability, and if you do so you may use it immediately as a bonus action. If used while inside a mook, this version is used automatically. Superpowered! (3) - Dylaxaphi taps into her hosts epithet or, and...Switches some stuff around. It’s a win/win scenario really, they get a bunch of innate shadowrealm powers for a while and she gets the ability to add properties of her host’s epithet to her actions! Once per Combat per Host. [25] New Minds! (3) - The best way to think about something is arguably to talk about it with another person. You use that epithet real cool and all, however Dylaxaphi just thought of another way to use it. Using her hosts current epithet (or core word, if they’re “lame and unfun”), she brews up a new way to use that epithet and uses the ability as a show of coolness! This ability is replaced with that ability, until she vacates to another host or combat ends! Once per Combat per Host...What? No! You don’t get to use it! Only she does, she thought of it and is already forming the patent in her mind! You wanna pay, like, licensing feels or some shit! Oh, she can also make anytimes...So long as she’s okay with making them as an action, and maybe not being able to use it at first."
ability,Dylaxaphi,Shadow Ooze,2,,"Dylaxaphi makes the shadow of a unit she’s possessing ooze off of them and materialize into their own person. This shadow has Dylaxaphi’s appearance modifiers on it and sounds like how she hears herself but otherwise looks like the person it’s based on. It has 3 stamina along with their basic weapon and either their abilities, their passives, or their talents(with shadowy flavors if applicable). Dylaxaphi has control over this shadow until it is knocked out, in which case it goes back to the person it was based off of. Once per combat."
ability,Dylaxaphi,Dark Evolution,X,,"Bonus Action. Note for GMs, don't undersell the cost, even if the buff seems minor. Failing to use this ability instead costs 1 stamina. As a non-human from the shadow-realm Dylaxaphi finds the limits of her host’s flexibility and inherently stable form to be incredibly annoying and difficult to work with. By infusing their genetic code with just enough black magic and otherworldly energy she can cause rapid genetic augmentation to give their form just the extra feature she needed to work with. She can only keep one such change in effect per every ten natural max stamina the host would have, to a total cap of 10 for someone with 100 or more stamina, any more and their body would just break down with herself getting lost in the mix. If she jumps to a different host anyone with Dark Evolution features must start paying upkeep equal to half of the X cost rounding up to keep them attached. At the end of combat if they wish to keep one of the features the host may spend max stamina equal to the X cost used to gain it, with half of that cost being given to Dylaxaphi"
ability,Dylaxaphi,D. Buff,X,,"Start of turn free action, has priority over other start of turn effects. Can be used on either Dylaxaphi or her Host’s turn. While normally things like “fear”, “acid”, “open wounds letting out way too much blood”, “being on fire”, and other things are bad for people, Dylaxaphi can’t be having a body that isn’t working right! She may choose one debuff they are currently going through and invert the effect to somehow be useful for them, this uses up a slot for Dark Evolution but is generally cheaper and cannot be made permanent. This ability is unaffected by any roll debuffs she might otherwise be put under. (It’s short for Dark by the way)"
weapon,Hildegard,The Kingmaker,,,"5 Damage 1 Range. A beam rapier with a crossguard designed and colored like a bismuth and the ‘blade’ itself being a vibrant magenta hue. This weapon changes properties and potentially stats or forms depending on Hilda’s active title. The Kingmaker has specifically been augmented by Hilda herself in order to only work with her specific psionic signal, making it unusable by others. The Kingmaker usually always does force damage."
talent,Hildegard,"Sharp Weapons, Sharper Wit",,,"Hilda has a very strategic mind due to years and years of playing basically every variety of wargame, from chess to Monkey Wrench(it counts). Due to this, she understands that information is power and thus always seeks to gain more when important. Whenever a session is about to occur that she will be a part of either as a main character or backup she can choose to gain intelligence on any form of predicted twist or 'fucky wucky oopsy scenario.' As well as the relatively known capabilities of the people within the session. She can try this on sessions she isn't in should they interest her, but she must roll to get anything substantial because it's only a passing interest. With this, the mass amount of funds her family has means she also almost always has some way to escape a situation if she really doesn't want to be there. However, if Rosche can guess a mid session twist or any other non-obvious revelation without prior knowledge(forgoing the intel) she will receive 1 proficiency, 1 max stamina, 3 companionship(to be given to who she wants), or a stored natural 10 in her next/current session. This may happen up to twice per session. Hilda may only store a maximum of 3 natural 10s and none will go away in a bounty unless it is used. She can turn 2 natural 10s into a stored natural 20."
talent,Hildegard,Putting My Mind To It,,,"Hildegard, upon making an attack, can choose to invest psionic energy into that person. The amount of energy invested is equal to the damage dealt and if it is the first time this combat that they receive psionic energy they immediately have a random title from Hildegard’s list bound to them. When a target has psionic energy invested into them, Hilda must pay 3 upkeep on each of her turns as the psionic energy is multiplied by 1.5x. When psionic energy reaches half(rounding up) of a target’s proficiency(maximum of 150 for you fucking psychopaths out there), all of it bursts out of them, dealing an amount of immutable psionic damage equal to half of the energy invested and gouging ¼ of their proficiency for the rest of combat. If this would lock them out of upgrades, they lose them as soon as they go under the proficiency necessary, but do not class down as a result. If Hildegard stops paying upkeep, all Psionic energy fizzles away harmlessly."
ability,Hildegard,Armament Revolution,2,,"Hildegard raises her hand as she receives a psionic version of her blade for each title within 15 ft of her. These psionic Kingmakers float around her, with her able to fire off up to 3 of them as a bonus or main action. They are able to travel up to 6 spaces and deal 4 force damage each. She may choose to spend an additional one stamina per Kingmaker to put the vague effects of a title into them, letting her apply the effects of them to their targets. She may also use up to two psionic Kingmakers as part of an attack she makes with them, boosting the base damage of the attack by 50% per psionic Kingmaker used. [18] Armament Vanguard - When a combat starts, Kingmaker shimmers in a magenta light, creating 1d2 psionic copies of it."
ability,Hildegard,[Solo/Duo/Trio] Empress Overlay,4,,"Hildegard’s body glows as she begins to float up slightly. A large psionic imprint of a glittering opalescent palace is pushed onto the area, with the ‘realness’ of it being determined by how many titles Hildegard has on the field at the time. This ability is once per combat between all variants, but she can upgrade Empress Overlay to the next version if she already has it active. Activating a higher version of Empress Overlay activates the lower versions but puts them in the area of the highest version. Each version takes a different amount of action economy. Solo Empress Overlay - As a movement action when Hildegard has 3 or more titles active she creates a 5x5 area on the arena which counts as her domain. Within her domain, entitled allies gain a +1 bonus to all effects they produce. She must move her domain to a new location at the start of her turns, but she cannot put it in a location where units are. Duo Empress Overlay - As a main action when Hildegard has 6 or more titles active, she creates a 9x9 area. Hilda may move-act-move within this area and can use 2 spaces of movement to teleport anywhere within it. Entitled allies within the area can use the benefits of their titles without any cost if it’d usually have it or heal for 2 if it had no cost. She can choose to warp the domain to a location of her choice in the arena at the start of her turns, bringing anything inside with it. Trio Empress Overlay - As an unrolled full action when Hildegard has 9 or more titles active, she clicks her heel on the ground as the full palace forms around the entire combat arena, making it count as her domain. This cancels any terrain or other lair effects and puts the entire area under Hilda’s control. In this palace, Hilda may use 1 movement to teleport wherever she wishes and can even use an anytime up to 3 times per round to teleport out of the way of attacks using this. Any action she takes will automatically be treated as a high success if it were lower and cannot be meaningfully interrupted or reduced in any way. At the start of her turns, Hilda may change 3 1x1-4x4 parts of the terrain as she pleases. If this is used, Empress Overlay is on cooldown for the next session Hilda is in."
ability,Hildegard,Precision Onrush,2,,"Hilda raises her weapon to her face before suddenly warping to a space within 3 spaces of an entitled target, a magenta trail being left behind. After warping, she may make an attack with her weapon against a target. If this attack hits, she can then perform the first part again at no cost. This can happen until she runs out of unique entitled individuals to teleport to. At the end of the chain, she may choose to return to her original position. If her current weapon is a ranged weapon, she may stay where she is to attack, but the targets must be within 3 spaces of an entitled target and she can only shoot one target in that area per use of this."
ability,Hildegard,Psionic Gate,2!,,"A large magenta circle appears beneath Hilda’s feet and another appears within 6 spaces of her that she can see. She then teleports to that space. The space does not have to be unoccupied and if it is occupied, the previous occupier takes 2 damage base +1 for every psionic sword she has (this reduces her current total psionic swords by 1) and is pushed one space away of Hilda’s choice. Once per round."
weapon,Nanashi,Blade Of Stabbing,,,"A small yet incredibly sharp kitchen knife that Nanashi carries around with them. It deals 4 damage at 1 range, but rolls with advantage. [28] Muffled Sounds Of “Crocodile” Violence - When Nanashi attacks something with their knife they do so with swift deadliness. This not only forces the first anytime used against it to be rolled with disadvantage but also, if they succeed, they may pay 1 stamina to gain a random mutation, however it only lasts until the end of that combat or scene. In addition, if they do this multiple times per combat the cost to do so is increased by 1 each time for that combat."
weapon,Nanashi,Black Croc Shooter,,,"4 Damage, 4 Range. A revolver that Nanashi can hide really effectively in their raincoat, it fires gears full of chronal energy. It has slight chronal properties and deals 4 damage at 4 range. On a natural 20 the gear fired is filled with an incredible amount of chronal energy that you can expend to take an extra turn if you grab it. 1d6 additional sneak attack damage. Upgrade 1: Whenever a Chronal Gear is fired on a Nat20, it is shrouded by the enchantment on Nanashi's Gear Gun making it hidden from the eyes of others. People can only find the gear by making a DC15 Perception Check to try and see it or using ways of perceiving things that are usually hidden from view."
talent,Nanashi,Just A Little...Thing,,,"Nanashi’s just a lil’ creature, just a little friend. It is hard to see Nanashi in too bad of a light, though it isn’t like they go out of their way to make friends with people. More importantly whenever an ally gains proficiency without it being from combat rewards Nanashi gains double that amount in Anima. [18] This...Thing...What Is It? - No matter what, Nanashi is not allowed to be the first party member targeted by an enemy in combat. This includes via AoE damage and collateral damage. [38] I Am Not Getting Near That - No enemies may move within 2 spaces of Nanashi during the first round of combat unless there is no other option."
talent,Nanashi,Something Of The Elements,,,"Nanashi may now use any of the rolled for Damage Types and change the typing of any attack they make to one of these types, they can also pay 1-5 stamina to increase the potency of the damage type relative to how much they pay. This should be filed under something similar to talents but for now will be considered “Magic”. Nanashi can spend 100 Anima or 5 Proficiency to roll another dX And gain access to the rolled damage type permanently. Once all 10 are obtained something else is unlocked. 1 - Darkness. 2 - Shembl. 3 - Gruwy. 4 - Earth. 7 - Water. 9 - Lillok"
talent,Nanashi,I Want To Go To Crocodile Country,,,"To learn the language and experience the wonderful sights. When Nanashi performs an action they may pay 2 stamina to try and apply a random word to that action, they must roll for this. They may only have up to 3 of their “actions” be enchanted with a word like this at a time, with the earliest being replaced when a new one is rolled for. All of these effects last until the end of combat. Note: When using this talent they may use either the normal random words generator or this generator. [Dr. E] Historical Artifact - Behold one of the ancient cultural objects of Crocodile Country! Nanashi can pay 1 stamina as a bonus action to enchant an object with a word they’ve used before. This purveys effects based on what the word is and the roll."
passive,Nanashi,Little Light,,,"The only thing that Nanashi had in their possession when they woke up was a single lantern that glows a soft grey light, not enough to see very far at all in dark places but it calms them down. They hold it in their tail."
ability,Nanashi,Mana Beam,1,,A simple green energy beam composed of magic. It deals 4 damage to all enemies within a 5 range line. Nanashi generates 1 Anima per enemy hit by this ability.
ability,Nanashi,Cross-X-Slash,2,,"With a magical glow coming from their lanturn and a swing of their knife, a space 3 spaces away from Nanashi immediately erupts with an arcane slash in the shape of an X using the designated space as the centre. The X is a total of 5 spaces long on both lines and can only be used on the diagonals. This deals 3 damage to all units in those spaces, this will always deal at least 1 damage to anything it hits. [23] Critical-X-Anima - Not only does Cross-X-Slash increase in damage by 2(to 5) but also Nanashi gains Anima equal to ¼ of the damage dealt rounded up."
ability,Nanashi,Scringledile,1!,,"Nanashi makes a speedy dash away up to 4 spaces. In one of the spaces they scringled through they leave a mark down. If anyone moves through the mark a tiny crocodile mouth sprouts up and bites their ankles, dealing 3 damage and halving their movement until the end of their next turn. Once per round."
ability,Nanashi,Sleeping Devil,1,,"Once per combat, Nanashi may go into a hibernative state for 1 round. This stops them from taking any out of turn actions of any kind but also heals them for 10 stamina and allows them to reroll a single mutation of their choice. "
ability,Nanashi,Crocodile Tears,2!,,"Nanashi just starts crying, like a lot, way more than you would think. It’s enough of a distraction that it allows allies to attempt a failed action a second time or try another action instead. They must pay the stamina cost if they try a new action. Once per round."
weapon,Charon,Rift Dagger,,,"With how dangerous his life can be, Charon came up with a design for a weapon he can use if the situation requires it.  Of course, he also imbued it with dimensional magic, as a joke.  This dagger deals 5 damage in melee range or 4 damage at 3 range, or it can also be used as a bonus action to open up a single Rift in a space adjacent to him, though he must spend 2 Stamina to do this.  He can throw the dagger into any one of his Rifts and have it emerge from another one, dealing its damage to a target within 3 spaces of the exit point.  The dagger then blinks back into his hand.  He can’t lose Sanity with this weapon unless he’s using it to open up the Rift or throwing it through a Rift."
talent,Charon,Honey~ It’s Time For Your 4PM Smoochie Woochie! -3- -3- -3-,,,"Once per combat, as a free action on Charon's turn, he can summon his succubus girlfriend, Ziri, to do a small non-damaging favor for him.  This does not count towards the once-per-round limitation of her associated ability, but he cannot summon her twice during the same turn.  After she performs this favor, she gives Charon a smooch on the cheek, restoring 3 of his Sanity."
passive,Charon,Gateway of the Other,,,"Charon draws his power from the place between all places; the infinitely small yet incomprehensibly vast static void (no relation to that other Void) that stitches the planes of existence together.  This liminal static exists only within our perceptions, but that doesn't mean it has no power of its own.  As a bonus action on his turn, Charon can spend 2 Stamina and make a roll to swap the positions of two people or objects on the field that are 2x2 spaces in size or lower.  He can also attempt to shift the position of just one person or object for 1 Stamina.  When he does this successfully, dimensional Rifts are left behind at the point of origin and destination, which can be used with some of Charon's abilities.  Rifts can be freely passed through by allies and enemies but deal 1 psychic damage to enemies specifically.  If a target is specifically forcibly knocked into a space a Rift occupies by one of Charon's abilities, there's a sound like shattering glass as they are forced into it and emerge from another Rift of Charon’s choice.  By default, this deals 3 psychic damage to the target, though other effects will happen instead if the Rifts are attuned to a different plane of existence with Channel Flick.  The damage and effects prorates heavily if a target passes through multiple rifts during the same turn. However, this otherworldly power is not without cost.  The powers of perception use the mind as their fuel, and Charon is constantly at risk of losing himself in the maelstrom of void.  Charon's red stat is Sanity.  His maximum Sanity, at base, is equal to his maximum Stamina, and increases as Charon's Stamina does.  Every time he earns a Companionship upgrade with someone, his maximum Sanity increases by 2.  When Charon rolls a natural 1-5 when using any part of his kit, he loses the inverse amount of Sanity (1 = -5, 2 = -4, ect.).   He also loses 1 Sanity when rolling any higher number as well.  When Charon's Sanity reaches half of its maximum (rounded down), each part of his kit becomes Unstable, giving it additional effects, and they remain such for the rest of the combat. At the end of combat, half of Charon's maximum Sanity is restored. If Charon reaches 0 Sanity, each part of his kit becomes Corrupted in addition to Unstable.  At the end of his second turn after his Sanity reaches 0, Charon's Stamina is set to 1 above his death threshold and he is knocked unconscious. [32] Selective Naught - Any projectile attack used by Charon or his allies can now pass through his Rifts, costing only 1 space of their range to do so. However, each time a projectile passes through a Rift in this way (except his Rift Dagger), Charon must lose 1 Stamina or 1 Sanity, his choice. They can pass through multiple Rifts if necessary. When they pass through a Rift that is attuned to a specific plane, the projectile gains properties of that plane."
passive,Charon,He Comes and Goes,,,"Charon can just leave whenever he wants, vanishing to any plane of existence he chooses.  Twice per session, he can retrieve something from that plane and bring it with him back to the party.  Doing this reduces his Sanity by 1-3 depending on what he retrieves.  It takes time to gather enough energy to leap between planes, however, so doing this during combat typically takes a full round, during which if he takes damage the action is interrupted.  He also can't do this if he's physically restrained in some way - it requires his full range of motion.   "
ability,Charon,Channel Flick,1!,,"With a mere flick of his wrist, Charon not only manifests an additional Rift in a space within 5 spaces of himself, but that Rift and all others that are currently manifested have their attunement shifted to a plane of existence of Charon's choice.  This can be anything from one of the Hells, the kingdom of Heaven, the Shadow Realm, the Witch Realm, or anything else the architects of this dumbass universe have come up with over the millenia.  The Rifts all gain a 5 foot radius aura that emanates a single property, effect, or aspect of the plane that Charon chose.  He can choose to switch the Rifts back ‘off’ with this ability as well, returning them to their neutral, static-filled state.  If he uses this ability again but does not change what plane the Rifts are attuned to, the auras of all rifts are simply increased to a 10 foot radius (though it cannot go higher than this.)  The effects emanated by each Rift do not overlap.  Once per round. Unstable:  This ability now costs 2 Sanity in addition to 1 Stamina. When used, Charon can reposition each of the Rifts up to 3 spaces from its original position.  In addition, the effect each Rift emanates based on the plane they are attuned to is distorted in some way, making them much more unpredictable. Corrupted:  All of Charon’s Rifts seem to spread like thin cracks in a glass pane.  At the moment this ability is used, the Rifts shatter the space around them, dealing 5 psychic damage to everyone inside one of their auras. If there is no aura when it is used, they do damage to everything adjacent regardless."
ability,Charon,Door to the Leviathan,2,,"Focusing on the power of darkness, Charon manifests a pitch-black door on any flat surface that leads to a dimension of pure darkness, darker and more unknowable than even the Void Factory. When stepped on by an enemy, the power behind the door bursts forth, dealing 4 damage in a 3x3 space area and knocking everyone back up to 4 spaces in directions of Charon's choice. This is a bonus action. Unstable:  The door can now lead to any plane of existence Charon chooses, and is attuned as such at the moment he places the door. This can give it additional effects on top of the damage and knockback. Corrupted:  In addition to the 3x3 area the trap hits, the infinite briar within its confines now lusts for blood more actively, seeking out the nearest living target, whether friend, foe, or Charon himself, and dealing damage to them as well. The damage the trap deals is increased by 2 in this state as well."
ability,Charon,Riven Bolt,2,,"A thin, violet bolt of pure destruction flies from one of Charon's Rifts or his outstretched hand, traveling up to 5 spaces in a straight line.  This bolt can be blocked, but travels so quickly it is immensely difficult to dodge by anyone of the same class as Charon or lower.  The bolt deals 6 damage and knocks the enemy back 3 spaces.  Charon can also sacrifice damage for additional knockback if he wishes.  If this ability knocks someone into one of Charon's Rifts, an additional Rift is manifested at the location the target occupied before the knockback occurred. Unstable:  This ability now costs 2 Sanity in addition to 2 Stamina.  Charon can fire two bolts up to two additional spaces away when this ability is used. Corrupted:  The bolts now deal damage to all targets in a line, and pierce all forms of DR.  Its Stamina cost is increased by 1."
ability,Charon,From Hell's Heart ,X!,,"Charon's desire to travel different worlds and learn their secrets is rivalled only by his desire to be topped. Thankfully, Ziri, his succubus girlfriend, is always happy to oblige. Not only that, but Ziri is a powerful fighter in her own right, and Charon has the ability to ask her for favors during combat. Ziri has a whip that can either deal 2-4 damage at 5 range, or attempt to wrap around someone to restrain or reposition them.  She also has standard succubus magic. She can also just bring Charon things if he wants her to.  She can appear anywhere in the arena, and a Rift is left behind at the space she appears in and the space she exits at. The cost of this ability is equal to the desired magnitude of its effectiveness, usually around 2-3 at the GM’s discretion. Charon can only lose a maximum of 1 Sanity with this ability. Once per round. Unstable:  Two additional Rifts are created in spaces of Charon’s choice.  However, Ziri sees that her boyfriend is straining himself again and gets pissed at him, dealing 3 damage to him with her whip before she leaves. Corrupted:  This ability can no longer be used when Charon is in this state, because he doesn’t want Ziri to see him like this."
ability,Charon,Storm Of Starspark,3,,"Charon poses dramatically, his cloak billowing behind him, as the sky above the combat arena is suddenly eclipsed by darkness. In five 2x2 areas of Charon’s choice in the arena, glowing meteors emerge from the portal and blast into the ground, dealing 6 damage to everyone in the area and knocking them back 2 spaces in the direction corresponding to their position in the square (north-west for for the upper-left space, ect.). Each area must be at least one space apart from each other.  The craters left behind by the meteors are difficult terrain, and if Charon spends 1 Stamina and 1 Sanity as a free action on a subsequent turn, he can manifest a Rift in the area of one of the craters. Using this ability also costs just as much Sanity as it does Stamina. Unstable:  If Charon's Rifts are attuned to a particular plane, meteors that Charon chooses carry the same additional effects that those Rifts have. If that effect is beneficial in some way, the damage the meteor would deal can be nullified if he chooses. If this effect would apply, Charon must spend 3 Sanity in addition to the Stamina cost. Corrupted:  Rifts are automatically created in every crater the meteors land in.  The cost of this ability is increased by 2.  "
weapon,Union,Bazooka Beatdown,,,"6 Damage, 1 Range. Manifesting his signature bazooka in his normal hand in a similar way one would wield a tonfa, Union spins it around and bashes into a target, dealing 2 knockback on 13+ rolls."
weapon,Union,Death Missile,,,"4 Damage, 5 Range. Manifesting his signature bazooka and quickly pointing it at a target, Union fires a large missile while turning away, not looking at the explosion like a cool guy."
talent,Union,The Silver Hand,,,"Union’s hand used to be the main source of his power, being able to augment bazooka-like growths out of it in many, many different ways. However, after becoming a part of the Bloodstone Island Training Regiment, this power has been made dormant. Union’s hand is still noticeably under the effect of an Epithet augmentation, just not as significantly as before. This, it is impossible to amputate, and it cannot come under negative health effects whatsoever, including bleeding, poisoning, burns, and the like. Its pain tolerance is also very high, and it is able to perform feats of supernatural strength. Whenever Union rolls a 15 or above on damaging something with a bazooka, a small turret pops out of this arm and he fires it at the same target, dealing extra damage equal to 2-4 of the initial attack’s damage."
passive,Union,"The Big, Bad, Ballistic Missile",,,"Union has many, many types of missiles at his disposal. But his best kind only come out when he’s really getting into the heat of a fight. Each time Union deals damage to a new target (Which resets when all targets have been hit), he gains 1 Ballistic Charges. Ballistic Charges are hard to remove, and at any time during combat, Union can spend his Ballistic Charges to manifest his ultimate weapon, The Ballistic Redback, a deadly radioactive missile with a distinctive 3x3 impact point with 4 various lengthened spokes. He will have to pay XY Ballistic Charges, X being the amount of damage he wants to deal, and Y being the length of the spokes. Anyone in the impact area will take the full damage (which is equal to the amount of charges spent on X times 2) while anyone in range of the spokes will take ¾ of the damage. After the initial explosion, a radiation zone will linger behind, applying radiation stacks to anyone who is in the initial blast/anyone who starts their turn in it. Those who have radiation stacks will take Xd2 radiation damage, X being the amount of stacks they have. There are limits and drawbacks to firing a Ballistic Redback, however. First off, a Ballistic Redback cannot be fired if any of the values are a 0. Second off, while he is immune to all other sources of bazooka damage, Union is not immune to gaining radiation stacks, although they are easier to remove for him if he has the right tools. Finally, while Ballistic Charges do carry between combats, firing a Ballistic Redback is a Once per Combat."
passive,Union,Ammunition Immunity,,,"Due to how much he makes and fires the stuff, Union’s learned how to completely become immune to the damage of bazookas and anything coming from them. However, in trade of this, the damage of the bazooka turns into pure knockback, potentially allowing enemy bazooka wielders to bypass Union’s immunity by knocking him where they want. People who purely use bazookas can especially manipulate the flightpath of Union when he takes a hit from one of their attacks. On the flip side, Union can use his attacks on himself to send himself flying right where he wants, and he doesn’t take fall damage when doing precisely this. While not as effective as the bazooka immunity, Union also takes reduced damage from all forms of explosions."
ability,Union,Homing Shot,3,,"Union manifests a longer than normal missile and fires it in a straight line, dealing 6 damage to the first person it hits, and 1 knockback in a direction of Union’s choice. While this is one of Union’s more standard attacks, he’s found ways to make it more flashy. By clapping his hands together as a free 2 stamina cost action, Union manifests a small chip and sticks it to an adjacent target. If Union uses this ability at a chipped target, the missile will follow them no matter where they go if they dodge. If the target somehow gets far enough away that the missile is unable to reach them, the missile has 10 movement and will pursue them each turn. However, it still can be blocked. When firing at a target with a chip, the missile deals 8 damage to the target, 4 damage to all surrounding units and will deal 3 knockback to the target. [35] Precision Sticking - Union’s been practicing flicking the chips he creates for Homing Shot from a distance to attach them to farther away targets. This increases the range of attaching the chip to a maximum of 3 spaces. The speed that he flicks the chip also makes it somewhat harder than normal to react to, increasing the DC necessary to block it with anytimes by 2."
ability,Union,Torpedo Terror,3⛯,,"Union jumps high in the air, spins his bazooka around, and attempts to fire at as many individuals as he can. He will roll a 1d3+1 to determine how many targets he’s striking down, with the option to add a +1 for every interval of 10 stamina he is away from his base. These missiles will deal 8-10 damage and up to 5 knockback upon impact. However, if an ally is targeted, Union can lower the damage and knockback, the amount depending on the GM and how high the roll is. Once the 1d3+X is rolled, Union must hit that amount of targets, unless there are less targets than the number rolled. Once per Combat."
ability,Union,Sniper Sattelite,3,,"Suddenly, from behind Union, 2 narrow bazookas zip out into the battlefield and begin to float within any area of Union’s choice, provided they’re within 4 spaces of his initial location. If anyone gets within 3 spaces of these launchers, they’ll be hit with a narrow missile for 4 damage. If Union wishes, he can force these launchers to fire on him if he ever steps in their range. These sniper bazookas have 5 stamina each and Union can use any unspent movement he has to move any of the snipers an equal amount of spaces. This ability can only be used if there are no other sniper bazookas on the field. [32] Sniper Siphoning - If an attack moves within the range of the Sniper Satellite, it may replicate the essence of that attack to use later. These essences can augment the missiles that come out afterwards. However, each satellite can only contain one attack essence."
ability,Union,Bazooka You!,1!,,"Union’s usually the one with the most explosive weapon most of the time, so he’s willing to lend his power to anyone and anything else so they can have some fun with it, too. With a simple wave of his hand, Union turns an attack into a bazooka, or a missile originating from a bazooka, right before impact, whichever makes more sense in the moment. This can either be used to exploit his passive immunity to bazookas, or potentially make an attack stronger if he desires. Once per round."
ability,Union,Missile Gap,1,,"As a Bonus Action, Union can suddenly create a fissure in the ground, and a bazooka pops out of it. This bazooka fires, and launches him way further than any of his other bazookas can, although low rolls will make it so he may land somewhere he doesn't want to go. This will also leave an explosion behind, dealing 4 explosion damage in the 3x3 area around the place where Union launched himself from. This fissure lasts for the rest of combat unless dealt with and will be treated as difficult terrain."
weapon,Griffith ,Last Resort Pistol,,,"In case he is ever placed in grave danger, Griffith carries a small pistol with him whenever he can. However, it is very old, and more of an antique than anything else. It deals 1 damage with 3 range. If this is ever used to try and calm Griffith’s Epithet down, it rolls with advantage."
weapon,Griffith ,Demon Barrage,,,"Griffith’s Epithet gives a wicked grin, cracking its “bones” before delivering a monstrous blow to an adjacent unit for 6 damage. Being hit by this move makes the target feel all of the heat leave their body for a moment as they see a wavering image of a skull flare up from behind the Epithet."
weapon,Griffith ,Controlled Rage,,,"Griffith, powered by the presence of his Epithet inside of him, causes his Epithetical aura to flare up before releasing an energy blast towards a target of his choice. This can be fired up to 4 spaces away, and explodes in the shape of multiple skulls in a 2x2 area, dealing 6 damage to all inside of it. This is only usable when under the effects of Devil’s Candy."
talent,Griffith ,Exquisite Taste,,,"Due to his Epithet, any stamina Griffith heals from eating food or anything else gets a 1.5x multiplier."
passive,Griffith ,Feast of the Soul,,,"Griffith’s Epithet acts a manifestation of his negative emotions and violent thoughts, giving it a natural proclivity towards destruction. Griffith himself prefers not to fight if possible, but when he’s forced to, he finally lets his Epithet out of its cage. The two act as separate units in combat, but have a shared singular movement and standard action between the two of them. All of Griffith’s abilities can be used by either one of them, but Griffith’s own actions are often far weaker in capability than his Epithet’s version. The Epithet itself cannot normally be knocked out, instead taking ¼ (rounded up) damage from all sources, which is then transferred to Griffith. Inversely, if Griffith is knocked out, his Epithet dissipates until he is back up. All abilities the Epithet uses are taken from Griffith’s stamina. [15] Force It Down - When Griffith and Wallow are being targeted by the same attack/effect, Wallow can choose to scream and open its mouth wide, taking the attack/effect in full force. This causes Griffith to experience the attack/effect at 1.5x effectiveness, but makes it so Wallow does not take damage from the attack, instead gaining a damage buff equal to half of the damage of the attack’s base for the next round. If something absorbed does not deal damage, Wallow instead gains a new effect that essentially acts as the inverse and/or a positive version of the absorbed thing."
ability,Griffith ,Survival of the Fittest - Griffith,3,,"With a small pulse of energy on his pointer finger, Griffith draws a circle on an object, the ground, or even in midair. This circle turns into a hole that is connected to Griffith and his Epithet. If anything enters the hole, it takes 5 damage which is then given to Griffith as healing, before Griffith’s Epithet then spits it up. The Epithet can spit the target any direction it likes, so long as they end up within two spaces of it. Only one hole can be present on the field at a time. [19] Digestive Path - If Griffith has a circle created from Survival of The Fittest on the field, as either a rolled bonus action or an unrolled movement action, he can quickly phase into the ground. In a moment, he is teleported adjacent to either the circle or within 2 spaces of Wallow. He can do the latter even without a circle on the field! If done as a movement action, Griffith can heal for 1 Stamina."
ability,Griffith ,Survival of the Fittest - Epithet,3⛯,,"An energy wave pulses out from Griffith’s Epithet as it raises its arms into the air. The energy continues to swell as the Epithet roars, drawing every unit on the field 3 spaces closer to it. Once this is done, everyone adjacent to the Epithet is overtaken by the energy as reality itself seems to bite down on and digest them. This deals 8-15 damage to all hit units, and they seem to vanish after being hit. A moment later, the Epithet spits up all the units anywhere within 2 spaces of it. Once per combat, and once this is used, Griffith’s variation of this ability cannot be used either. [19] Digestive Path - If Griffith has a circle created from Survival of The Fittest on the field, as either a rolled bonus action or an unrolled movement action, he can quickly phase into the ground. In a moment, he is teleported adjacent to either the circle or within 2 spaces of Wallow. He can do the latter even without a circle on the field! If done as a movement action, Griffith can heal for 1 Stamina."
ability,Griffith ,Survival of the Fittest - Devil's Candy,3⛯,,"Raising a single arm into the air, Griffith releases a volley of demonic energy that lands in three 2x2 areas of his choice. These areas begin constantly erupting in skull shaped flames, dealing 6-9 damage to anyone inside. Any summons hit by this are immediately destroyed, and all buffs a hit unit had are removed and transferred to Griffith. Once per combat, and the areas do not go away unless deliberately removed by something. [19] Digestive Path - If Griffith has a circle created from Survival of The Fittest on the field, as either a rolled bonus action or an unrolled movement action, he can quickly phase into the ground. In a moment, he is teleported adjacent to either the circle or within 2 spaces of Wallow. He can do the latter even without a circle on the field! If done as a movement action, Griffith can heal for 1 Stamina."
ability,Griffith ,Devouring Vortex - Griffith,1!,,"With a quick snap, Griffith produces a small ball that begins vacuuming a chosen object towards it. The ball can either be held by Griffith or placed on an adjacent space/object. Once per round. This uses up the once per round limit on the Epithet’s variation of the ability."
ability,Griffith ,Devouring Vortex - Epithet,1!,,"Griffith’s Epithet screams as a tear in reality appears in front of it. This sucks in any nearby attacks and small objects, adding them all to the Epithet’s makeup. From here, it is able to apply effects based off of the sucked in things to its or Griffith’s actions, but only once for each sucked in thing. Once per round. This uses up the once per round limit on Griffith’s variation of the ability."
ability,Griffith ,Devouring Vortex - Devil's Candy,1!,,"Griffith takes his pistol and fires an Epithet infused bullet that can land anywhere within 7 spaces of him. If it hits a unit, it deals 2 damage. Regardless of if a unit is hit, a vacuum ball is produced on the space that the bullet hit. Once it is produced, it creates an infinite line vacuum in a cardinal direction, dragging everything it touches as close to the ball as possible. Once per round."
ability,Griffith ,Stockpile Up - Griffith,2,,"Griffith pulls out a small bottle, in which he produces a liquified version of his Epithet. Initially, all this does is build up a stack of stockpile on Griffith. As a free action on his turn, Griffith can expend his stacks in order to start healing himself at the start of his turns. The amount of rounds this lasts is equivalent to the amount of stacks he had when he expended them, and he heals stamina equivalent to the number of rounds this effect has to last."
ability,Griffith ,Stockpile Up - Epithet,2,,"With a hardy step, Griffith’s Epithet begins inhaling with great force. Initially, all this does is build a stack of stockpile on Griffith’s Epithet. As an action, it can expend its stacks in order to produce a mouth-fired, massive energy beam. This beam is 3xY (Y is equal to the amount of stacks expended) and deals 4 times Y damage to all units hit by it. Every turn spent stockpiling after the first successful use of this ability is a free action."
ability,Griffith ,Stockpile Up - Devil's Candy,2,,"Griffith grits his teeth, revealing a small piece of pure red candy in his mouth. Using this ability to gain a stack of stockpile is a free action, as energy begins surging towards the candy. As an action (on a turn that has not used the free action version of this ability), Griffith can then spit the candy out, causing it to zoom to any space on the field. It then explodes in a puff of skull shaped smoke, initially covering a 3x3 area, but growing one size category every 2 stockpile stacks expended. Everyone in the explosion radius takes 6 times Y (Y is equal to the amount of stacks expended) damage, and then is sent flying out of the area."
weapon,Nyx,The BOLT BARRIER,,,"A big ol’ shield that Nyx really cannot hold very well. It’s designed to look like a lock with a lightning bolt over the front of it. There’s a hole in the center that can maybe catch weapons...if they’re like, huge or something. This does 3 damage at 2 range, but they can choose to take an unrolled move action after the attack to plant their barrier into the ground. After being planted, ranged attacks coming from that direction that hit the shield are deflected to the side! Melee attacks need to be rolled against to be blocked, reducing at least some of the damage either way. Plushie 1."
talent,Nyx,Waslow The Bear,,,"One day Nyx tripped and fell into a weird hole, ending up in a cool colorful place with a bunch of friendly and fun people! They had a really fun time but eventually Nyx had to go home...but not before being gifted a really cool plush by a nice lady with magenta hair. It has some cool magic on it...so Nyx says. It’s especially powerful when used with Nyx’s ability to bring their plush toys to life! He specifically has double the stats of the regular stuffed bear, but he can only be animated once per session. It’s also unbreakable and returns to them when not in their possession so no one can steal it! Also, sidenote, but Nyx is pretty prone to accidentally tripping and falling into random dimensions and demi-planes and then similarly accidentally popping out later. We’re All Mad Here - When Waslow is afflicted with a random effect of any kind (except this list), they may pick an additional result, one that is up to 2 above or 2 below what they rolled. (They can do this for Nyx or themselves, but not both) Waslow gains this effect and an additional one from this list for free, must be rolled randomly. All In The Cards - Roll a d4, this unit’s essence is bound to this result. 1=Hearts. 2=Clubs. 3=Diamonds. 4=Spades. The die result on this effect may not be chosen or rerolled and this result can not be gained multiple times. Diamonds - Unit gains a tertiary stat known as Diamond. Diamond has a maximum of 13. At the start of the unit’s turn they roll a d4, this is how much Diamond they have for the round and it resets when new Diamond is added through this method. Diamond can be spent to add numerical values to anything, this must be rolled for and can not be added to a stated maximum, can not be used to increase DoT damage, only a maximum of 2 Diamond may be added to any one thing and will cost 2 stamina as a main action to do. Lasts for a maximum of 2 rounds."
talent,Nyx,Pickuppable,,,"Nyx is very small and light and can fit through many spaces. They are also the correct size to be picked up by all of their friends without question. They can be picked up as a free action and thrown up to 10 spaces away as part of the same action, with them curling up into their hoodie and thus taking no damage on impact. If people throw Nyx between each other as part of a team tech, Nyx's end of it has advantage!"
passive,Nyx,Patchwork Surgery,,,"Nyx loves playing doctor. See, their plushies can’t just die when they’re turned into nothing but stuffing! They can be made better. Whenever a plushie is set to 0 or below, they are reduced to piles of fluff which kinda just sit around. Nyx can collect the fluff on the ground to have as a resource for later. By the end of combat, all surviving plushes are converted into fluff for Nyx. Nyx can use an unrolled main action and spend fluff to make a custom plushie, with each fluff being able to be spent for 1 damage, 1 range, 2 stamina or 1 movement and 2 fluff being able to be spent to add an extra effect on the Plush. These custom plushies always have a special action they can take. If this custom plushie survives until the end of combat, Nyx can keep it and reanimate it with Abraca-Animate! All fluff left unused at the end of a combat is set aside, letting Nyx make more of any custom plushies they’ve made before so they can bring more into future combats or even spend them to make one of their base plushies with a new special effect! Custom plushies and base plushies can only have one extra effect. [6] Fluffy Guard - Nyx can use a bonus action and spend fluff to put a fluffy shield onto others, giving them DR[fluff] to all blunt damage and half of that to all physical damage. Fire burns this away, but it otherwise will usually last an amount of hits equal to the fluff spent."
ability,Nyx,Abraca-Animate!,2,,"Nyx brings out one of their many stuffed toys and brings them to life, taking control of their bodies to move them about! These stuffed toys have different stats and effects based on the type of animal they are. Nyx can have a maximum of 2 plushies out at a time before needing to make a save at the start of their turn to keep them up. The DC starts at 7 but increases by 1 for every plushie over 2 they have and if they fail all of their plushies fall apart. Stuffed toys take 1.5x fire damage. Nyx can also use this on other items but they are...nowhere near as effective at all and forces them to start rolling saves on their next turn. Bear - The stuffed bear has 6 stamina, a 3 damage attack and 4 movement. They can use an action to swipe all adjacent spaces, doing their damage to all enemies in that area with their slightly sharp claws. Bunny - The stuffed bunny has 3 stamina, a 1 damage attack and 7 movement. They can move-act-move and use an unrolled action to reposition people freely. They can also hop over terrain hazards and other floor-based things. Dog - The stuffed dog has 8 stamina, a 2 damage attack and 5 movement. They can use an unrolled action to puppy-guard allies within 3 spaces of them, automatically taking damage for them."
ability,Nyx,Dark Spell!,1,,"Nyx brandishes their shield, using it to focus one of their powerful magic spells! They plant it in the ground like with their basic attack and then start casting! If this fails, they roll a 1d2 for curse or wild magic and their book casts it on themselves. They only have three spells and they need to cast them in order, you see. For fairness. Plushie 1. Balloon - Nyx takes out a big-ol balloon and tosses it over their shield. This balloon has a cool looking design...but that's a trap! If something touches this balloon, it bursts into thumbtacks and other sharp things! Everything adjacent to the balloon takes 2 damage and a stack of LC bleed, with a target taking more damage the more squares in the area they take up. The balloon moves in a random space every turn as the wind pushes it around. Thunder - Nyx takes out a taser and opens up the center keyhole of their shield before stuffing their arm through and tasing a fucker. This does 4 damage and 2 stacks of Shock. Blizzard - Nyx throws a bunch of ice cubes over their shield, pelting a 2x2 area up to 3 spaces ahead of them for 3 damage, and causing the ground there to become slippery terrain for a round. Slippery terrain has people roll a DC6 check while moving through it to not slip and fall prone."
ability,Nyx,Grabby Grabby,1,,"Nyx swooshes up to their movement in a straight line, being able to pass through enemy spaces if they need and nabbing an item from the pockets of enemies they pass. They additionally pull out a mundane item from their storage of stuff. They can make use of that item as a bonus action, but it usually only has 1d2 uses before they need to put it back. Plushie 1d3."

If you point it in someone’s eyes they take one damage and may have a penalty until the end of their next turn. (AQ) Space Orbital Laser - Space Gun becomes a sight ranged laser bombardment which obliterates anything in a five by five foot pillar, which can be angled from any direction to potentially hit targets within the air, for 6 damage.

Whilst in this form, Faye’s psychic abilities experience changes, they gain a new basic attack, the “Space” Rock orbits around them as it glows with power, allowing Faye to roll an additional d20 on any action once per round and add it to the result of her action, which may either increase it in power or functionally allow her to perform two separate feats with the same action. Faye cannot handle the strain and stress of this form for long. They may only access their form number of rounds per day equal to their Proficiency score divided by five. Any more would require them to roll saving throws against death every round. If Faye would ever naturally age up to the point in time where she would normally be during this transformation, through any means other than this passive, then this passive will experience a great change."
passive,Faye,Curious Little Cat,,,The transformation Faye underwent left a deep impression on her mental state. She’s more open to exploring even minor curiosities and must roll a saving throw to resist acting in impulsive ways when confronted with a more major curiosity.
ability,Faye,"I Could Crush You With My Mind, If I Wanted…",2,,"She really could, you know! She just doesn’t want to bully you puny humans. Hmph! As a full-round action Faye may focus her almighty psionic majesty onto a single space within three spaces to bear down upon them with unfounded strength! This causes the target to take 1d3 force damage and… feel sorta heavy? They suffer a movement penalty equal to half of the damage taken, rounded down, to a minimum of zero. Faye may also attempt to use this ability at half cost as a bonus action to perform extremely minor acts of telekinesis but due to her lack of control she almost always loses control and damages the object. She can only move objects with a weight under five pounds and only one space at a time before it takes one damage and falls at the end of her turn. (AQ) I WILL Crush You With My Mind, Because I Can… - I Could Crush You With My Mind, If I Wanted… has its range increased to nine and its damage increases to 3d3!. If this would reduce a targets movement to or below zero then they lose their movement action until their movement would return. When used as a bonus action it can move a target up to three spaces every turn and Faye may choose to deal one damage to the target every turn."
ability,Faye,"If You Need My Help, I Guess…",1,,"Faye may now attempt to psychically charge up an object or item to… increase its battery life by up to ten percent! Wow! If an object benefits from or operates off of an energy of any kind… it may also experience minor boons to operation, but usually nothing drastic."
weapon,Rubedo,Diabolical Damage,,,"You may attempt to use whatever form the Instability engine currently is in to deal damage, if there are no direct stats for it the GM will say how much they feel is fair for the current form. [8] Diabolic-er Damage - You may always deal a minimum of 1 damage at 1 range when using the Engine as a weapon, and you always roll with at least a +1 when using it."
weapon,Rubedo,Also a Knife,,,"Listen, you try committing assault against someone with a stick of butter sometime then you can complain. 4 damage one range."
passive,Rubedo,Instability Engine,,,"Your epithet takes the form of a constantly shifting item with a multitude of potential uses! Whilst you require its capabilities it is summoned into your hand as an unrolled free action with a form dependent on a d50 roll. You may desummon it on your turn at will. At the start of your turn if you keep it out it will shift forms again, while outside of combat it will shift if you attempt to use it each time you attempt to take a new action with the engine. You may pay one stamina to attempt to stop a shift but you must roll above a 9 to do so. CHAOS; CONTROLLED! - If you get a result you have previously rolled on the instability engine you may have it have that form’s properties and instead roll for a second item which it actually is. In addition, you roll advantage on any non Instability Engine rollable table you would interact with and may selectively take an item and incorporate it into the multitude of forms your epithet can take as a rolled bonus action on your turn."
ability,Rubedo,Destabilizing Devastation,2!,,"Quite the excellent show of power you have there, ‘twould be a shame if its molecular and energy composition destabilised before it could achieve its intended purpose now would it not? Requires you to physically intercept the chosen action with the Engine, you can throw it in the way if you wish/are physically able to. Otherwise you must be in the direct line of the action you are interrupting. Deals roughly 3 damage if done on a person. Once per round."
ability,Rubedo,Regular Magic,2,,"I actually went to wizard college instead of mad scientist college for something like a solid month. Listen, the campuses were like, right next to each other, and a lot of the wizards seemed evil enough. Cus you know. Liches and doomsday spells and so on. Anyway, I can try and do basically simple magic shit but my epithet is also like “haha no you can’t”. On Anything other than a 18+ this turns into a casting of wild magic. Even what would normally be considered a “failing” roll counts and still activates this. This cannot be affected by reroll abilities."
ability,Rubedo,Touch of Insanity,2,,"The world at large does its best at staying consistent and logical however if someone were to physically make contact with a major Inconsistency and have it transfer an inherent illogical madness onto a person or item, well, its consistency would be thrown out of wack now wouldn’t it? You may cause a seemingly random debuff or alteration to something of your choice so long as you have the Instability Engine make physical contact with it. You may treat this as a basic attack if you want to cause harm as well."

talent,Luis,JACKPOT!!!,,,"With any given rollable table/luck based game, any time Luis would roll off of it they may choose to replace their result after seeing it with one of the results on the table that they have seen before. This may require rolls if Luis attempts to slot in the same result over and over, with the DC getting much higher each additional time he tries it in the same session."
talent,Luis,The Odds Are Stacked Against Me…,,,But the House ALWAYS wins! Rosche gets advantage on all 'convince GM' and non-start of session luck rolls and may gain proficiency upon any natural 20 with either the character themselves OR Luis so long as Luis has been interacted with somewhere in the session.
talent,Luis,Triple or Nothin',,,"Upon getting the choice for a stat reward of some kind, Luis may choose to try his luck! They may roll 1d10 and modify the rewards! This can only be used once per session and can only trigger the 7-9 and 10 effect once in a data bounty per month. The d10 is unmodifiable. 1 - Luis does not get rewards this combat. 2-6 - Rewards are halved for Luis. 7-9 - Rewards are multiplied by 1.5x for Luis. 10 - Rewards are tripled for Luis."
passive,Luis,Fortune Favored,,,"Luis' fortune is a constant for their existence and it only increases. Luis has a stat called ‘Luck,’ which is spent to increase their abilities potency through the use of extremely lucky blows. They gain Luck equal to 5x the result of their pre-session luck roll and gain half of the result of any other roll they make as Luck. At any point on their turns, Luis may spend Luck in order to add a die onto any value or effect on their kit! These all have set prices. Additionally, they cannot just purchase a higher die size immediately, needing to spend Luck in order of size to get up to that die. If Luis adds another luck die to a single feature, the Luck cost for that die is multiplied by 1.25(rounded up), and further dice costs are multiplied by a further .25 for each increment. The dice are lost at the end of a session, but half of his unspent points are kept. In data bounties, the amount of points gained within are quartered and then added to the total. Every value of Luis’ is capped at half of his current proficiency before outside modifiers. 1d2 - 3 Luck. 1d4 - 6 Luck. 1d6 - 9 Luck. 1d8 - 12 Luck. 1d10 - 15 Luck. 1d12 - 30 Luck. 1d20 - 50 Luck. 1d100 - 75 Luck."
ability,Luis,Heads or Tails?,2,,"Either way, Luis ALWAYS wins! Luis takes out an antique gold coin and flicks it at a target within 6 spaces! This target takes 2 damage and the coin then bounces to up to 1 target(s), carrying any effects from what it hit with it as it travels and dealing half as much damage as it did to the last person it struck. The coin’s range for bouncing is equal to the range for throwing it and if Luis attempts to hit the same target more than once he has to roll again and beat an increasing DC that the GM decides. After the attack, the coin somehow finds its way back to Luis without fail."
ability,Luis,Gold Rush,3⛯,,"Luis dashes forward and unleashes a flurry of 1d4!+1 baby punches that deal 1 damage each. With each punch, roll 1d10 and on a 10+ the punch strikes a critical spot and deals 2 more damage along with 1 random debuff! After the punches, the target suffers 2 knockback. If more than 3 punches occur, this is Once Per Combat. [46] Golden Opportunity - Luck isn’t just a once in a lifetime thing! It’s not even a once ‘every few minutes’ thing either! Luis knows this better than anybody. Gold Rush is now Recharge 20 on a d20 rather than being once per combat. When Luis’ recharge triggers, he may replace any amount of ‘random debuffs’ from the next use with a wild magic he may target on himself, the target of the punches, or people within 3 spaces. He may target them as he rolls them but may only change one."
ability,Luis,Lucky Me,2,,"Luis chuckles like a smarmy bastard and moves up to half his movement. He pokes someone he moves past, knocking them prone and causing misfortune to be upon them. Luis can channel Luck Points to make luck dice subtract from something’s effects. The target is considered to have a negative luck value equal to the points spent and can gain Luck like Luis would, with them being able to end this debuff if they start their turn above 0 luck points. Luis gets 3x the roll in Luck for using this ability. Bonus action."
ability,Luis,Effect Roulette,1!,,"Whenever Luis would be affected by something, he can use this to store the effect in a special golden roulette wheel. Everyone in the arena then rolls 1d20 as a luck roll and whoever gets the lowest is affected instead! Luis may spend Luck to modify the dice of people he chooses before they roll. [51] Yeah, I’m Not Taking That. - Luis may freely give out 1d2 +/-d6 after every luck roll has been made to potentially shake up who actually takes the effect. It additionally can be used twice per round and Luis may do it on ongoing effects against him or on people within 3 spaces of him."
ability,Luis,Demon's Blood Panic,2,,Luis smirks and takes out a red coin covered in black flame. He flips it while looking menacingly towards someone. Luis can choose to either gain an impurity or force the target of his next action to gain one. These can be saved against at the end of an encounter. Bonus Action.
ability,Luis,How Unfortunate...,2,,"Luis briefly mentions a very unrelated horrific accident or event that happened earlier and mentions how *unfortunate* it would be if it somehow affected what’s happening here! Oh nooooo, it DOES affect here! Whatever unfortunate thing Luis was talking about is supernaturally drawn to this area by his epithet, affecting a 1x1 area, dealing 1-2 damage and applying either 1 stack of a debuff based on what Luis was talking about or just 1 random effect because who KNOWS what that stuff encountered on it’s way here. Dice on either damage number affects the other. Dice can be switched between any number on this ability. Luis may spend luck on this ability in order to reduce it’s necessary action economy. 5 Luck - Bonus action. 10 Luck - Swift Action. 15 Luck - Anytime (Once Per Round). 30, 45, etc - Adding another usage per round to the anytime."
weapon,Balthasar,Stopgap,,,"5 Damage 2 Range. A stop sign that is chained to Balthasar’s arm during combat, it’s coated in his smoky orange-black aura. When he strikes a target with this, they get a stack of ‘upheaval.’ Upheaval can be exchanged by allies as they are attacking that unit to force them to be prone as a result of the attack. [18] Reaching Rebellion - You've trained your body or honed your skill. You gain one additional space of reach(to 3) while wielding the Stopgap and may choose to pull yourself toward a target or a target toward yourself by one space on an average success or higher and you may spend one Stamina to increase the pullback dealt by 1d4. On a roll of 4, you may choose for Upheaval to be immediately applied and refunded."
weapon,Balthasar,Tiger Claw!,,,"2 Damage 1 Range. Balthasar’s weapon of choice when not using his sign is his skillful hands! He may attack twice with this basic weapon and on rolls of 17+, can apply ‘upheaval.’ Upheaval can be exchanged by allies as they are attacking that unit to force them to be prone as a result of the attack."
talent,Balthasar,Anarchic Grace,,,"Our paths are our own to make. There's no way I'd let you push me towards anything else. Balthasar may attempt to use forced movement, such as knockback, to their advantage by describing how they achieve it."
talent,Balthasar,You Don't Control Me.,,,"Who do you think you are? I'm not some kind of puppet! If you try to rein me in then I'll just cut the strings! Balthasar's free will cannot be easily suppressed. Whenever Balthasar would be forced to act under the orders of another through mind control, manipulation effects such as telekinesis, blood bending, or shadow puppetry, or similar methods intended to control the body or mind… Balthasar may immediately attempt to roll a saving throw to break free of its effects. If such an action would possess an extended duration, then Balthasar may attempt a new saving throw at the start of each of his turns. Balthasar may or may not take damage or stamina cost as a result of breaking out of certain effects. [32] You Can't Tell Me What To Do! - This is no time to worry about rules and laws with the odds stacked against us. Times are tough! We're changing history, for the better, and you can stuff it! There's no need to complain or debate! I'm gonna do it anyway! Whenever Balthasar is told that an action is against his better judgment, incredibly difficult to perform, incredibly unlikely, is forced to obey any kind of law, or otherwise put in a scenario where someone is trying to deter Balthasar through intense or powerful means… it only makes Balthasar more determined to see it through until the end! This grants Balthasar scaling bonuses towards attempting to resolve said scenario, action, or whatever until it no longer becomes a problem or Balthasar is rendered incapable of solving it, either through loss of determination, defeat, or the problem going away. These bonuses may be as broad as the GM allows but Balthasar is always allowed to temporarily spend points of Free Spirit until the end of an encounter to increase an action's effectiveness by 10% per point spent, increase the natural result of one of their rolls by one per point which can negate critical failures and cause Proficiency granting critical successes, replace Stamina costs by spending an equal amount of Free Spirit, or temporarily add bonuses to base statistics for the duration of a round. Balthasar may also gain Free Spirit for fighting through especially difficult scenarios or managing to succeed despite 'impossible' odds."
talent,Balthasar,Rebel Against Time,,,"Well, Balthasar figured that there was one MAJOR problem with all famous rebels and rebellions in the past-- they died. Now, not all of them died due to age, but like...let’s just cut out that factor! Balthasar now no longer ages unless he wants to, meaning he is specifically immune to aging effects and the like."
talent,Balthasar,House of Cards!,,,"Whenever an enemy is knocked down by Balthasar or one of Balthasar's allies, they may take another action OR 'Baton Pass' the action to another ally. The same individual may not be affected by this talent more than once in a chain. Every time an action is Baton Passed it gains a stacking +.25 boost to effectiveness, starting with 1.25x effectiveness and capping out at x2 effectiveness."
passive,Balthasar,Know Your Enemy,,,"Balthasar’s power is bright and loud, it is the voice for the oppressed and the shield for the small! Balthasar subtly learns to work against things he’s fighting as he experiences them more and more. Whenever he is afflicted by a negative effect, he gets a charge of ‘Know Your Enemy’ against the source of it(or the effect itself if the source isn’t a creature or an organization, or anything else of the like.) He has a max of 9 charges against 1 source, which grant bonuses against it. Every 3 charges will always give a secret action to be used against the source with the stipulations that they cannot be doing the same action and they cannot have the same trigger between any of them. (1) Gain a bonus to countering this enemy equal to ⅓ the charges they have, rounded up. (2) May make an ‘attack of opportunity’ against this enemy if they leave your attack range once per round. This only deals half of your weapon’s damage(rounded down). (3) You receive a secret action that can only be used against this enemy. It cannot have the same trigger or action as another one of your secret actions. (4) Gain a bonus to attacking this enemy equal to ⅓ the charges they have, rounded up. (5) When your attack of opportunity hits this enemy, you may either end their movement OR force them to move half of their remaining movement in a direction of your choice. (6) You gain another secret action like the 3 charge effect. (7) Gain a bonus to all rolls against this enemy equal to 1/3 the charges they have, rounded up. (8) Attacks of opportunity now crit on 19-20 and can give proficiency on a critical hit, with the base damage being half your weapon damage(rounded up). (9) You gain another secret action like the 3 charge effect, though your secret actions now have a natural +1 which prevent them from critically failing and can push you to critically succeed."
ability,Balthasar,Rebel Guard,1!,,"Lexical smoke swells up around Balthasar from his epithet, reducing the damage from an attack to 1 or 2 and reducing any other negative effects, though his epithet still didn’t take a liking to it. He gains double the amount of charges he would usually get against this enemy from this effect! Once per round."
ability,Balthasar,Insurrection Install,3,,"2 Upkeep. Balthasar's smokey aura flares around them so much that their form is silhouetted and all you can see is the literally burning passion in their eyes! While active, the Stopgap has an aura equal to its basic attack range. This aura makes any attempts to deter Balthasar or his allies only embolden them! Debuffs are turned into buffs, status effects all help him in a way and every anytime used against him increases his basic attack damage by one until the end of his next turn. Alternatively, as part of activating this or as an action, he may slam the Stopgap into the ground, dealing basic attack damage +1 to anyone standing in that space and pinning them to the ground, changing the aura as well to give all enemies who start their turn in the area a stack of ‘Upheaval’ and give Bal a charge of ‘Know Your Enemy’ against them. He may pull the Stopgap out of the ground as part of a basic attack action. Additionally, while Balthasar is in his aura, he can twice per round roll a d8 against a roll to negatively affect him. If his d8’s result is half or higher than the enemy’s roll, the effect is halved. If he rolls over their roll, the effect is reduced to basically nothing and he may take an action at halved effectiveness to counter. Once per Combat. [28] Insolent Resurgence! - There's more to the Stopgap than just the sign! The attached chain is a very real part of it, and its utility is only further accentuated while Balthasar is in his Insurrect state. While Insurrection Install is active Balthasar may spend their movement action to drag the Stopgap into any space adjacent to themselves, or into their hand. It deals half of its basic attack damage, a single stack of Upheaval, and two spaces of knockback in any direction of Balthasar's choosing to all targets of Balthasar's choosing along its path. Let It Rip! (1) - Balthasar holds the Stopgap aloft and proceeds to throw it into a deadly spin up to double its range away to deal half of its basic attack damage to all targets within a radius equal to its range and two spaces of knockback. This also covers the affected area in his Epithet's signature smoke which acts as an extension to his aura until the effect is dismissed."
ability,Balthasar,Active Defiance,2,,"As a bonus action, rebel against something to ignore how it usually works for a round."
weapon,Adelaide,Toil and Trouble,,,"Fire burn and cauldron bubble.  Adelaide stirs her bubbling Cauldron and brews a wonderful potion. If she does this as a main action she chooses which potion she brews, but she can also do this as a bonus action, but doing so is a little bit more dangerous and unstable as she brews a completely random potion from her list, in addition, if she does this 3 times in a combat, on the third time there is a 50/50 chance it will explode in her face immediately activating the potion’s effect on herself and dealing 2 damage. Adelaide can also use “ingredients” she finds around the place and add them to her Cauldron to modify the potions she brews.  She can do this as a free action that always succeeds unless the object is particularly large or otherwise difficult in some way. Potions are a free action to be used or drank by herself or allies. Potions: Healing/Acid: A simple healing potion that heals the one that drinks it for 4 stamina. Or an acid splash that deals 5 damage if drunk and 3 damage to enemies in a 2x2 area at 4 range if thrown. Love/Hate: The classic witch-y brew, when used on a target they fall in love with the one who used it on them meaning they cannot target them for 1 round and if they are given a suggestion by them they must roll to resist it, but it cannot be something that would directly hurt themselves. Or a Hate Potion that when drunk the one who drinks it gets a +5 to hit one target with offensive actions for 2 rounds. Bone Hurting/Milk: Delicious bone hurting juice when used on someone or drunk, it causes the bones to weaken and hurt, the one who is affected now takes an extra 2 damage from all physical sources and 1 damage at the start of their next turn. Or, Milk, that’s it. Just milk. Makes the bones strong and grants 2DR to all physical damage for 2 rounds when drunk. Curse/Hex: A classic Hexas Hex rolled using a d10. Or a strange curse from some other C U R S E D source. Smoke/Wind: A potion that acts like a smoke bomb, when thrown on the ground it creates a 3x3 smoke cloud that obscures the surrounding area, this one can be used as an anytime action, it has “DO NOT DRINK” written on the side. Or a potion of instant wind that can be used to clear any area of pollution, gasses, dusts or any other kind hazard such as this, while it won’t do damage it will also do 2 knockback to everyone in 3x3 area centred on the user, but not affecting the user itself. It has “Please Breathe In Case Of Emergency” written on the side. Flying/Gravity: A potion that, when drunk, grants the target flight and +1 movement for 2 rounds. Or a gravity potion that, when drunk, makes the target slower and heavier, reducing their movement by 2 and removing any flight abilities or even jumping. Speed/Slow: A potion that increases the thought process of the one that drinks it, granting one of their anytimes an extra usage per round for 2 rounds (or if they don,t have an anytime, turning a normal ability into an anytime for 1 round). Or it can be used to slow down the thought processes of another and removing their anytime usages for 1 round (or if they don’t have any, stopping them from using bonus actions on their next turn). Intellect/Stupidity: The brain expands of the one who drinks it, filling their minds with ideas, grants a roll bonus for the more complex and inventive ideas they use for their next action. Or the brain shrinks of the one who drinks it, filling their minds with stupid ideas, grants a roll bonus for the stupider and dumber an idea they use for their next action. 40 - Brewmeister - 10 New Potions.  Adelaide can now create an additional potion on her turn by paying 1 Stamina, this is considered separate from any imposed action limits but can only be done once on her turn. This does count towards her bonus action potion brewing but the random explosion chance is now after 6 instead of 3."
weapon,Adelaide,Magic Stirring Spoon,,,"A long wooden spoon perfect for stirring potions.  It also doubles as Adelaide’s witch staff.  While unable to brew potions for some reason, she can whack someone in the head for 3 damage at 2 range. 27 - Adelaide still has some of her bubbling brew left in the spoon. As a bonus action on her turn she is able to splash the brew on to a target up to 3 spaces away applying the effect of the last potion that was made but with slightly reduced effectiveness. She cannot do this again until she brews another potion. Also she gets either +1 damage or +1 range. (Range increased to 3)"
talent,Adelaide,Family Feud,,,"Adelaide’s power allows her to pick up on things extremely quickly, so fast that it could even make family members jealous.  Very jealous.  Whenever Adelaide rolls a natural 20, even if it’s on something incredibly mundane or innocuous, she earns 2 Proficiency from it.  The GM must explicitly allow her to roll for mundane things like searching for something or recalling a fact, she can’t just spam rolls for things and earn Proficiency from it.  In addition, all Stamina rewards she receives from any source are cut in half (rounded down, minimum of 1).  Also, Adelaide has a photographic memory for random trivia, making her really good at certain game shows."
talent,Adelaide,"And If You Say No, You’re Toast!",,,"Adelaide doesn’t take kindly to being interrupted nor her potion making interfered with. Once on her own turn and once per round otherwise if someone tries to interfere with an action she is taking with intent to interrupt her she can use either “Blast Of Darkest Magic”, “Hexas Born And Raised” or a random negative potion effect from “Toil And Trouble” to counter and interrupt them regardless of range."
passive,Adelaide,The Black Cauldron,,,"Adelaide has her witches’ Cauldron with her at all times, cleaned and ready for brewing.  The Cauldron is very large and impressive.  You are jealous of it.  When combat begins, she conjures the Cauldron in a 2x2 area within 5 spaces of her starting position.  She can spend 1 Stamina to teleport the Cauldron to a new location within 5 spaces of her as a bonus action on her turn.  The Cauldron can be attacked and destroyed, having 8 Stamina total, though it is heavily resistant to magic damage.  Not only this, but when the Cauldron is attacked, touched, messed with, or Adelaide even believes you might interfere with her potion brewing, she can immediately use an ability on the pompous fool who stepped out of line.  If her Cauldron is destroyed, she must spend 3 Stamina and use a bonus action to attempt to create a new one, or she can use a main action and not have to roll.19 - A Lid - As a bonus action on her turn Adelaide can take a lid and either put it on or take it off of the top of the cauldron. While the lid is on the cauldron nothing can be put into the cauldron and a roll has to be made for things to get out of the cauldron. If the lid stays on the cauldron for the entire round the next 2 potions she brews have doubled potency. She is not allowed to have brewed a potion on the turn the lid is put in place unless she puts an new ingredient in there first. 38 - Trusted Partner - The Black Cauldron now has 12 stamina. Instead of using an ability to stop something from interfering with her Cauldron, she may now have the Cauldron take the hit which reduces the total damage it takes to a max of 4 and adds properties of the attack or action into her witch’s brew. If Adelaide is adjacent to her cauldron she can even have the action be redirected towards it instead of hitting herself. This can be done without a roll to instead send half of the damage and/or effect to the cauldron, otherwise it must be rolled for."
passive,Adelaide,You Are Now Mastering X,,,"Adelaide is very intelligent for her age and learns exceedingly quickly. Adelaide gains a +1 to her rolls every time she fails to do something. This stacks until she succeeds. If it gets to +4 in this way she also gets advantage on her next two rolls. She also gets advantage the first time she tries anything new or tries to get some new information about something specific for the first time in a session. 30 - A New Spell? Intriguing… - If Adelaide encounters magic of any kind, once per spell per session she can attempt to start learning to do it herself. For now it’s a weakened version but she may spend proficiency to bring it up to its full power again. This is determined by the strength of the spell itself. Adelaide may pick 3 spells she has seen prior to this upgrade to gain immediately, these cannot be spells of ridiculous power. "
passive,Adelaide,Transformation Sorcery,,,"A spell that takes many components and has a long cast time.  Purely for out-of-combat roleplay purposes.  Can transform someone's physical form and features on a more permanent basis than a simple polymorph.  They must consent to the transformation, though."
ability,Adelaide,Alchemical Assasult,3⛯,,"Adelaide throws out an actual ton of potions that she had just hidden on her person in 3 separate 4x4 areas, they are explosives...mostly. She can detonate any amount of these areas as an anytime action and deal 6 damage to every enemy inside or adjacent to the areas, and they do overlap if they need to. In addition to this if she pays 1 Stamina when she detonates an area she can add up to 2 potion effects of her choice from her list to everyone that gets hit by it (including herself and allies) and they can be modified once each. Once per combat. 32 - She can lay down a single 3x3 area and it detonates immediately with the same rules as normal, but it does not take up the once per combat usage."
ability,Adelaide,Quickened Polymorph,2!,,"Waving her spoon and muttering a spell, Adelaide turns someone within 5 spaces into a form more befitting of their foolishness.  The target transforms into a tiny, harmless animal for the next two turns on initiative, and whatever actions they’re performing are interrupted.   If the animal is added to her Cauldron, it can be used as an ingredient, and the target takes damage from the sizzling brew.  Once per round, unless the one she uses it on has just messed with her Cauldron in some way. 24 - Adelaide is now able to cast this up to 7 spaces away, unless the target is someone who messed with her cauldron in which case there is no upper range limit. In addition, the polymorph lasts for 3 turns."
ability,Adelaide,Blackest of Dark Magic!,1,,"Adelaide fires a bolt of pure darkness filled with broken skulls out of her spoon or outstretched hand at a target up to 5 spaces away.  Deals 4 damage if it hits, and on rolls of 15+ it also curses or hexes the target, Adelaide’s choice.  If she uses this on her cauldron, it causes it to spin on its axis, scooping up an adjacent target and adding them as an ingredient, as well as doing heavy damage."
ability,Adelaide,Hexas Born and Raised,2,,"As much as she may not enjoy her...lineage, Adelaide has learned to make her own hexes. She swings her big spoon at someone and sloshes some hex potion onto an enemy with 3 spaces of her inflicting them with a hex, determined by a d10 and dealing 3 damage. If she is adjacent to her cauldron she rolls this with advantage and either doubled range or can hit two targets at one.

ability,Adelaide,Lesser Healing Suds,2,,"A spell Adelaide has picked up from a certain axolotl girl.  This version only heals an ally within 5 spaces for 2 Stamina, and cannot be used as an anytime.  It is a bonus action instead."
ability,Adelaide,Splish Splash Sploosh,4,,"Adelaide’s cauldron tips from side to side and a large amount of potion is let loose onto a 3x6 area adjacent to cauldron, this deals 10 damage to all enemies in that area and properties of the ingredients Adelaide has used this session are added to the effects. Allies in this area are hit with a random positive effect of one of Adelaide’s potions. This can only be done three times per combat and once the third time's used Adelaide cannot brew any more potions for the rest of combat as the cauldron is out of brew. Every two times this is used in a session all previous ingredient effects that have been used can no longer be used for this ability."
ability,Adelaide,Axolotl Storm Of Darkness,5⛯,,"Adelaide may not have a familiar like her silly pink friend, but she's learned from her enough to conjure a temporary one.  Storm Of Darkness is a 1x1 axolotl familiar with 10 Stamina and 6 movement.  As an action on its turn, it can use some of Adelaide's abilities:  Blast Of Darkest Magic, Quickened Polymorph, Hexas Born And Raised, and Lesser Healing Suds.  She can also basic attack with her knife for 3 damage.  Adelaide can hop on top of her and use her as a mount if she wishes.  Once per combat."
ability,Adelaide,Broom Dash,1,,"Countless other witches can do it, and thanks to aunt Abigail, now Adelaide can too.  As a movement action, she conjures a magic broom that she can use to fly around on.  The broom can only fly up to 10 feet in the air unless Adelaide spends additional Stamina, 1 per 5 feet, to make it go higher for that round.  The turn she uses this, she can move with it up to 4 spaces.  On subsequent turns, she can move up to 10 spaces while on the broom.  She's knocked off the broom if she's hit particularly hard or gets knocked prone.  She must spend 1 upkeep at the start of each turn to keep the broom conjured. "
ability,Adelaide,Cauldron Coffin Shark,3,,"Adelaide points her staff, glowing with green magic energy, at a unit she can see and a few seconds pass and Adelaide looks pleased with herself but nothing seems to happen at first. At the start of the target’s next turn, giant green magic energy sprouts up beneath them and Adelaide’s Cauldron, temporarily equipped with magic shark teeth, chews them up and deals 9 damage initially. Regardless of their size, they are now trapped inside Adelaide’s Cauldron that has moved to that location, they may use half of their move action (rounded up) to leave the Cauldron without rolling but taking 4 magic damage and a negative potion effect. They may also use their bonus action to try and escape as well but this requires a roll with the same effects, but a failure results in them taking another 3 damage. Adelaide gains a property or two of their target to add to their brews. Recharge Odds."
weapon,Artemis,Draco Verus: Dual Pistol Mode,,,"Two ornate black pistols with a golden dragon design, Draco Verus’ base form. They only deal 1 damage at 3 range but Artemis can fire them as many times as they want on a turn allowing them to move in any direction one space (including up). However, it will be their main action to fire it even once and they must pay stamina to fire it multiple times, 1 stamina per shot after the first 2 shots, 2 stamina per shot after the 4th and 3 stamina per shot after the 6th and up. They must roll for each shot. 37 - Dual Pistols - The base range is increased by 1. Vampire - On rolls of 15+ the curse within Artemis’ guns actually heal her for half the damage dealt (rounded up).

It can be fired twice per turn so long as she pays 1 stamina for the second shot and it is a main action to fire it once. 37 - Shotgun Mode - The damage of the shotgun is increased by 1 on both versions and she may choose how far she is knocked back, up to 5 spaces.

Artemis can purposely fire a blank shot with a lot of force behind it in any direction they wish dealing 0 damage and 3 knockback at 1 range and allowing Artemis to move up to 6 spaces in the opposite direction that they fired, this can be done as a bonus action. 37 - Rifle Mode - So long as it is the last attack at the end of an attack chain, the bayonet on the end of Draco Verus deals 1.5x damage and has a crit range of 17+.

talent,Artemis,**You! You’re Dead!**,,,"At the start of combat, Artemis can pick a single enemy in combat, they are her focus. For the first round in combat she has advantage on all of her actions against that target but disadvantage targeting any other enemy. After the first round it becomes a +2 to actions taken against that target, but there is no longer a negative to targeting others."
passive,Artemis,Dragon's Curse,,,"Draco Verus may be her trusted partner, but it is also super cursed. Once per session. At the start of a combat Artemis has a percentage chance of the curse taking effect, she becomes more violent and her draconic features become a bit more prominent. This increases her movement by 1, gives them 1 lifesteal on rolls of 14+, a +2 to all their rolls and adds a fire effect to all of their attacks. But they must attack an ally at full force at least once in combat, if they do not, for the rest of the session they lose 2 movement, they lose 1 stamina every time they roll 3 or below, minus 1 to all their rolls and all of their damage is reduced by 1 to minimum of 1 (unless it was already less than 1 in which case it is 0). When the combat starts the GM decides the percentage chance of this happening based on her mental state, who she’s fighting etc. An earlier combat would likely be very low but a later combat would likely be very high. If she has not transformed at all in the session she *will* in the last combat. This does not apply in sessions that only have one combat. In the case of a single combat session (PvP etc, the GM might increase the chance of it happening mid combat, once per round after the first)."
ability,Artemis,Bullet Hell,3,,"Artemis moves up to their movement in any way they wish, so long as it is physically possible, and fires Draco Verus in it’s Dual Pistol mode.

She can now use Slick And Slide while airborne."
ability,Artemis,The Sting,1!,,"Artemis has a tail, it was a bunny tail but now it is a long and fluffy tail. She can use her tail and extend it up to 2 spaces away and grab things to either pull them towards her or pull her towards them. She has also learned how to harden the fluff on her tail allowing her to stab it into things (and people) allowing her to stay stuck in walls, deal damage or even attempt to block small amounts of damage. Once per round. 39 - Twice As Hard Or Twice As Often - When using “The Sting” Artemis may pay an additional stamina to increase the range by 1, roll it with advantage and make it generally even more effective than it otherwise would be. If she chooses not to do this when using it she may just use it an additional time per round without the rest of this upgrade."

ability,Artemis,Draco Verus - Dragonblast Minigun,3,,"This stupid gun has to have something more to it right? As Artemis thinks this for the first time Draco Verus begins to glow and transforms into a new form, a black and gold minigun. This new form is heavier and clunkier than she is used to right now but it sure is useful as she may immediately start to fire it at a target dealing 1 damage, then 2, then 3 and pushes the target back one space. This does not stop after Artemis’ turn ends and in fact continues for 5 more turns repeating the 1, 2 and 3 damage cycles with the 1 knockback. The minigun does not have a range limit and she does not need to roll to continue firing. Artemis does not need to continue firing at the same target but she cannot use any anytimes except “The Sting” unless she stops firing. If Artemis wishes she may progress her curse ever so slightly further and also reduce the amount of switches she can make on her next turn by 2 to have this be considered a normal ability, otherwise it is a once per combat.

weapon,Blackberry,Gravity Fists,,,"Not only is Blackberry inordinately heavy for her small size, but reality itself slightly unravels whenever she exerts physical force.  Her punches deal 6 damage, and apply additional effects depending on her Hunger. Hungry:  The target is also hit by a Reality Warp effect. Ravenous: If she wishes, Blackberry can immediately use Hungering Void at no cost as an anytime action on the target (it will not have additional Ravenous effects if she is Ravenous.)"
weapon,Blackberry,Technicolor Prisma,,,"A sword created by the powerful demon and weaponsmith: Azazel of Hell, and commissioned by Blackberry’s girlfriend, XoXo Lotle. This pristine blade is incredibly potent, dealing 8 damage as a melee weapon and having the capability of firing a rainbow cutter projectile that can travel up to 8 spaces away. For every space the projectile travels past melee range, the damage the sword deals is decreased by 1. If Blackberry desires, she can funnel up to 5 Hunger into the blade, increasing the damage and/or range by that amount (which she can allocate however she desires). Using this weapon costs 1 stamina at base, but for every point of Hunger used past the first, the cost is increased by 1. The stamina cost for using Technicolor Prisma does not increase Blackberry’s Hunger."
talent,Blackberry,Supermassive,,,"Despite her small size, Blackberry is much heavier than she looks.  It’s extremely difficult to push her, knock her back, or otherwise forcibly move her with physical effort alone."
talent,Blackberry,Chaos Control,,,"Whenever Blackberry or her allies roll on the Reality Warp table, they roll 2d10 and pick the effect they want."
passive,Blackberry,Living Window To The Ravenous Dark Naught,,,"Blackberry is essentially a living black hole, hungering endlessly for physical matter and breaking down the laws of reality.  Blackberry’s red stat is ‘Hunger’, which has a maximum of 10 and minimum of 0.  As her Hunger increases, so too do the strange eldritch anomalies that constantly accompany her every movement.  With 0-3 Hunger, no additional effects occur.  With 4-7 Hunger, she is considered ‘Hungry’, affecting some of her abilities.  With 7-9 Hunger, she is ‘Ravenous’, affecting some of her abilities even further and stacking with the ‘Hungry’ effects. If she reaches 10 Hunger, she transforms into an all-consuming black hole of gnashing teeth 3x3 squares in size, losing access to all of her abilities.  She can still move normally.  Everything and everyone she passes through while moving must roll to try and escape, taking 7 damage on a failure.  Each target she deals damage to reduces her Hunger by 3.  If she ends her turn with less than 4 Hunger, she transforms back to normal.  While in black hole form, she takes double damage from all sources. For every Stamina point Blackberry spends on abilities, her Hunger increases by 1.  If an increase in her Hunger pushes her to 10, her action is cancelled and she immediately turns into a black hole.  She can also try to reduce her Hunger by eating random things during combat, but it takes a movement action to do so. 49. Back in Black - Blackberry can now use abilities while in Black Hole Form, but they cost 2 extra stamina than usual.  The Stamina spent in Black Hole form does not add to her total Hunger. 82. Schwarzschild Radius - While in Black Hole Form, Blackberry only takes 1.5x damage as opposed to double damage. Along with this, she gains a 1 cost, once per combat anytime that allows her to nullify a projectile within 2 spaces of her, immediately consuming it in the process."
passive,Blackberry,Variety Is The Spice Of Life,,,"Blackberry loves it when things are diverse and cover a wide range of different types of things. As such, whenever she performs an action that is different than the action she last took, it gets a +2 to its roll. Similarly, she can maintain an aura that grants this effect to allies adjacent to her so long as she pays a Stamina point at the start of her turn."
passive,Blackberry,Event Horizon,,,"Blackberry, upon achieving a new spiritual resolution within herself, has sprouted majestic, rainbow colored wings. These wings, typically feathered, can be hardened to a glasslike structure, containing energy within. Not only do they allow her to fly naturally, but also, whenever Blackberry is affected by any sort of status effect/buff/debuff, she can attempt to instead transfer it into the structure of her wings. If it is a positive effect, it can be stored without a roll, but if it is negative, she must roll to do so. She has a pool of up to 4 status effects at any given time, and these statuses carry over between combats and sessions. As a bonus action on her turns, she can fire a stored status as a beam at a unit within 4 spaces of her current position, afflicting them with said status. However, every time a particular status is used, it is distorted, slightly changing its effects."
passive,Blackberry,Experience Love Like Never Before,,,"Blackberry’s Epithet won’t stand for staying too same-y with its capabilities! Fortunately, its strengthening, along with long term exposure to a certain witch’s magic, has allowed Blackberry to be in a sort of perpetual flux. At the start of combat, Blackberry can choose any of her abilities. If this ability is a main action, it is now an anytime for the combat. If this ability is a bonus action, it now has a separate anytime usage that costs an additional 2 stamina for the combat. If this ability is an anytime, it becomes a twice per round for the combat. If The Chaos Continues is chosen, it becomes a Twice per Combat for the combat. Blackberry cannot choose the same ability two combats in a row, which carries over between sessions."
ability,Blackberry,Diversity University,2,,"Gives two of Blackberry’s allies within 6 spaces a one-use token that can temporarily alter the laws of reality.  The token is a free anytime action to use, but it must be applied to either give a new effect to one of your own abilities, or an ability of the opponent’s that is targeting you.  The effects can enchant the ability itself, or the person hit by it, user’s choice.  When using it on an enemy ability, you have to roll against it.  Roll on the Reality Warp table for the effect. All of the effects only last a maximum of one round. 45. Giving Out Scholarships - Diversity University is no longer a Once per Combat."
ability,Blackberry,Rainbow Rain,3,,"Blackberry targets a 3x3 area within 7 spaces of her with a storm of rainbow-colored light.  Enemies in the area take 3 damage, and allies in the area heal for 3 Stamina.  Everyone is hit by a single Reality Warp effect.  She cannot use this ability twice in a row. Hungry: The rain becomes sugary sweet and highly acidic.  It deals 5 damage to enemies instead of 3, and instead of summoning the rain, Blackberry literally becomes it.  She teleports to the space she centers the rain on, and she heals for 5 Stamina and gets hit by the Reality Warp effect. 64:  Walking On Sunshine - Rainbow Rain has its range increased from 7 spaces to 12 spaces."
ability,Blackberry,Part of a Complete Breakfast,1!,,"With a flick of her wrist, Blackberry can cause two objects that are within 5 feet of each other to suddenly meld together, and the new object now has the properties and uses of both separate objects.  Depending on how powerful/unique the new object is, it might split apart again fairly quickly.  Once per round. Hungry:  While Hungry, Blackberry can fuse PEOPLE together in addition to objects!  The fused characters must be allies and must consent to being combined together.  While combined, each of their turns happen simultaneously, with each player taking an action as normal, but the actions are combined in some way and have a +3 bonus to the rolls.  The more powerful or unstable the fusion, the less time it lasts for.  Fused targets both take damage when they're hit, but it's somewhat reduced for each of them. Ravenous:  When fusing two allies together, they also get a ‘Reality Warp’ token that they can use while fused. 35. A Moment That Lasts Forever - So long as Blackberry is touching an object fused by Part of a Complete Breakfast, it can stay fused indefinitely. This is also true for fused characters, unless she is part of the fusion. 93. Heartfelt Connection - Blackberry can now fuse people so long as they are within 5 spaces of each other. Along with this, Blackberry can now choose to pay one extra stamina when using Part of a Complete Breakfast in order to access the memories and residual energy someone Blackberry has fused with in the past. In essence, this allows Blackberry to “fuse” with someone not in combat so long as she has fused with them before, although it is more like she is utilizing their power to achieve their form temporarily. Utilizing this type of fusion is weaker than doing it with a person that is actually there, and she cannot fuse into the same form two times in a row."
ability,Blackberry,Hungering Void,1,,"Blackberry lashes out with the dark manifestations that constantly accompany her, dealing 4 damage to one target within 5 spaces.  If the target has been affected by a Reality Warp effect during this combat, they take 6 damage instead. Hungry:  The darkness grows in strength, and in addition to the first target, any other targets within 5 spaces of the first who have been hit by a Reality Warp during this combat also take 6 damage.  Any Reality Warp effects remaining on hit targets are consumed. Ravenous:  Everyone hit by this ability is now also hit by a single Reality Warp.  In addition, the initial target of the attack must roll to resist or be pulled 5 spaces closer to Blackberry, and if they end up in the space next to her, she can make a free ‘Gravity Fists’ attack against them (the attack will not have any additional Hungry or Ravenous effects). 71. Twin Darkness - When Blackberry uses Hungering Void, if there is a tear from Tear in Space present on the field, she can pay an additional stamina to have a second instance of the ability occur but with the tear as its origin point."
ability,Blackberry,Tear in Space,3,,"With a toothy grin, Blackberry scratches the air and produces a correlating rip in the fabric of reality. This can be placed anywhere on the field, and the tear leads to a widely different plane of existence than the one Blackberry is inhabiting. Upon creation, and at the start of each subsequent turn, Blackberry can choose for the tear to either suck every unit on the field 3 spaces closer to it or to spit out an object of her choice from that plane. To maintain the tear for multiple turns, Blackberry must maintain a 1 stamina upkeep cost. Once per combat. Hungry: The vacuum of the tear becomes more intense, dragging units 4 spaces closer to it and dealing 1 damage to enemies specifically. Ravenous: Blackberry no longer needs to pay upkeep cost to maintain the tear. 52. Fluctuating Wormhole - If Blackberry wants, she can pay 2 stamina to move the tear created from Tear in Space somewhere else on the field as a free action on her turn."
ability,Blackberry,Black Within the Rainbow,0,,"As a bonus action, Blackberry becomes covered in rainbow light, casting a shadow that takes the form of Sister. Sister, appearing adjacent to Blackberry and having a 4 space movement action she can take before anything else, can perform any one action from her sheet (The Fragments’ character sheet from Colour Out of Space, excluding Broken Window To An All Consuming Void) but with Blackberry Prime paying Stamina cost. Along with this, Sister has her own version of Technicolor Prisma. However, hers is pure black and named “Black Within The Rainbow”. While the standard Technicolor Prisma represents Blackberry and XoXo’s bond, Black Within The Rainbow represents Blackberry coming to terms with herself. Black Within The Rainbow (the sword) costs 2 stamina at base to use (which does not add to hunger), and inversely to Technicolor Prisma, Blackberry can elect to gain hunger to add extra damage onto the slice. However, when doing so, there is a small chance (1-5 on a d20) that Blackberry gains some extra hunger that does not add to damage. If one sword modifies Blackberry’s hunger in one turn, the other cannot. Once Sister has performed her action, she returns to Blackberry. If Sister uses Instant Implosion, this ability cannot be used for the rest of combat."

weapon,Cadey,Electrical Wires,,,"A forest of blue and orange wires emerge from Cadey’s hair and from under her sleeves, lashing out at enemy targets anywhere on the arena.  This electrifies an enemy and deals 5 damage, as well as restraining them in place unless they can escape.  If she wishes, she can use this on two targets instead, though each of them will only take 2 damage.  Once per round, if she pays 2 Stamina, she can use this attack as an anytime."
weapon,Cadey,Game Over!,,,"Boy oh boy, are you FUCKED now, gamers!  Cadey stretches out a hand and summons an enormous, blood-red axe make of segmented metal and covered in red, purple, and orange neon lights.  Cadey can whirl this axe in a circle around herself, dealing 8 damage to all targets within 2 spaces of her, or she can smash it downwards on a single target for 12 damage.  The roll has advantage if she’s targeting someone who refused to pay her Stamina for ‘Continue?’.  She can only use this axe if her allies give her a cumulative 800 tickets to unlock it, or if someone refuses to pay Stamina for ‘Continue?’.  This axe can be used three times before it has to be unlocked again."

She and Cadey have met, they play Mario Kart sometimes. **”Nepenthes” (999 tickets):**  It’s off-brand.  Greatly dampens the effects of the drinker’s epithet for five rounds, and deals 5 damage to them at the start of each turn. "
ability,Cadey,New High Score!,3,,"Cadey’s an expert at almost any kind of game!  With this ability, she replicates an attack that has already happened during this combat and uses it on a target of her choice, but it is slightly more effective than it was the last time.  Twice per combat. 42 - Arcade Bash! - Cadey can use “New High Score!” to perform an action based on an arcade game or machine. This cannot be anything of fighting game super level or higher unless she pays an extra 2 stamina. When gaining this upgrade she may pick up to two genres from this list, these are the genres she can pull arcade game moves from. This does not use up it’s usage limits. Fighting Games, Racing Games, Gambling Machines, Shooting Games, Activity Based Games (Skeeball, Whack-A-Mole, Air Hockey etc), Claw Machines."
ability,Cadey,Continue?,3,,"Cadey channels her gaming power to impose a Continue screen over a target’s existence.  The target must choose whether or not to pay Cadey 5 current and maximum Stamina.  If they pay her, then the next time she uses this ability on them, the cost will be 1 less.  If they choose not to pay her, then Cadey’s ‘Game Over’ weapon is unlocked."
ability,Cadey,Hazard Havoc,2!,,"With a snap of her fingers, Cadey summons a harmful obstacle from any arcade game that has ever existed.  If this obstacle is avoided or dealt with in some way, the person who dealt with it is rewarded 200 tickets!"
ability,Cadey,"Hold on, Pass Me the Controller",2,,"Cadey sees that someone isn’t doing that well and wants to show them how it’s done!  She conjures a game controller with aesthetics that are somewhat based on whatever target she uses this on, and with this controller she can forcibly control them to take a single movement and main action of her choice!  This ability has a -5 penalty when used on enemy targets, but that penalty decreases by 1 each time an enemy has rolled a 5 or lower within the past round."
ability,Cadey,Tech the Throw,1!,,"At the last moment, Cadey leaps off of an enemies’ attack, propelling her 4 spaces away and sharply reducing the damage she would’ve taken!  This works much better on physical attacks than on other kinds of attacks."
weapon,Cecelia,Light Piercer,,,"The Erebus Family Heirloom, a devastating sword that molds itself to fit it’s chosen user. Cecilia has been trained to use this sword since she was young and as such it has bonded with her to the point where it will just return to her if separated for too long. It has taken the form of a giant needle which can create thread in it’s eye. 1 range 6 damage and can be thrown or swung around like a whip or flail but will only deal 3 damage at 6 range in this case."
talent,Cecelia,Blind Sight,,,With her blind eye Cecilia can get glimpses of people’s possible deaths. As a bonus action on her turn she can glimpse into a target within 3 spaces’ future and see how they could die giving them a -2 to their next 2 rolls and allies a +2 to hit them for one round. This cannot be used one the same target multiple times in a row. She does have to roll for this but it does not cost stamina.
passive,Cecelia,A Tear in Space,,,"Cecilia is able to use her epithet to slip between the small holes in space/time and exit elsewhere. On her turn she may use this power to move up to 10 spaces away as a teleport, she cannot be targeted during the movement, if she does this her regular movement for that round is reduced to 2, however this also leaves a rip in space/time that others (including enemies) may access both for their own movement or to throw abilities/attacks through it. If 3 or more things pass through the tear (aside from Cecilia) it will destabilise and explode that tunnel dealing 5 damage to enemies standing adjacent to either it’s entrance or exit point. The tear’s entrance and exit lasts for two rounds. On her turn, instead of moving through the tears in space she may try to put a pair in locations within 10 spaces of her, including on enemy spaces, moving whatever’s there to another tear of her choice, if there are no other tears the tears are able to be placed within 10 spaces of either her or Persephone."
ability,Cecelia,Detainment Protocol,2!,,"Cecilia creates a pair of giant buttons and slots them into both ends of the space/time tear from her passive, blocking the passage from being entered or exited by anyone/anything except herself, Persephone, or their own abilities. If an enemy or action is within 2 spaces of either of those entrances she can forcefully pull them inside the stream. So long as they are 2x2 or smaller. If an action is trapped inside the tear she can cancel this ability as an anytime action and fire it at a target of her choice, the range is determined by which exit point she uses. If a person, creature or thing is trapped inside they are not able to interact with things outside the tear nor move outside it, though they can still see things going on, if they are not able to escape the tear before the end of their next turn they take 5 damage as the dimensional energy builds up and forces them out of an exit of Cecilia’s choice. If this portal stream is destabilised or explodes while a unit inside they will take double the damage and will be placed in a space of Cecilia’s choice 3 spaces away from a portal exit. If Cecilia enters the tear while an enemy is trapped inside it (or an enemy enters the tear while she’s inside it via her passive or ‘Land of the Erebus Twins’), she can make one attack against them with Light Piercer with advantage, though doing so immediately ends this ability and ejects both of them from an exit point of her choice. Using this ability extends the length of time a tear stays in existence for, depending on the roll. Only one pair of buttons can exist at a time. Once per round."
ability,Cecelia,Portal Stacking,2,,"Cecilia creates a portal and then a second portal overlapping with it, destabilising them and firing a laser beam out in front of her dealing 5 damage to everyone in a 7 space line. If the portals are created over the tear from her passive it can be fired from the other portal, and it deals 8-12 damage instead, but doing so forces a destabilisation causing it to explode and dealing damage as per her passive."
ability,Cecelia,Spinning A Good Thread,2,,"Cecilia creates some thread with the Light Piercer and then throws the Light Piercer at a target within 7 spaces while holding the thread. It attaches itself to the target by spinning around it dealing 6 damage, if it’s an enemy. Cecilia can then pull herself towards the target or bring it to herself as an anytime action, by paying an extra stamina while doing this she can slam the target into the ground or through a portal for 3-5 damage. If she does not do this the target is unable to move their arms."
weapon,Celestine,The Sword of Damocles,,,"Yeah, that’s right, it’s the real-ass goddamn Sword Of Damocles! It’s taller than she is, Celestine can swing it for 6 damage at 2 range if she rolls a 16+. If she doesn’t it deals 3 damage instead. The base damage is considered 6 for the sake of crits. If she does hit an enemy she rolls a d100 calling odds or evens, if she calls it right they feel the crushing weight that those in power should feel making them lose half their movement. This costs 3 stamina to use.12 - Ruling With An Iron Blade - Celestine can spend an additional 3 stamina to deal 1.5x it’s damage (rounding up) and guarantee the extra effect. But if she rolls an 8 or below she takes an additional 3 damage, she does get to keep the damage multiplier or the guaranteed effect but not both. She may only do this before seeing the roll itself and may only do this on basic attacks made with the weapon."
talent,Celestine,Really Big Trucks,,,"At the end of combats, after they have been fully healed, a d100 is rolled with Celestine calling high or low. If she calls it wrong she gets hit by a bigtruck which deals half of her maximum stamina in damage (this cannot be stopped nor negated, it is just toobig, huuge) if she calls it right however one of her Pathetic Little Minions takes the hit instead. The truck then continues to drive away."
talent,Celestine,Pillard,,,"A pillow that has been brought to life by….someone. While they aren’t alive anymore they still have vague truck defensive properties remaining, Celestine can reduce the damage from trucks by 2. (6) - Celestine wonders if this pillow can be useful in other ways. As a bonus action on her turn she can hug the pillow, if she succeeds she gets 1DR vs Physical for the round. Nothing happens if she fails."
talent,Celestine,Queen of the Castle,,,"Celestine is actual royalty, regardless of her situation. But she is also a child and very bossy. She has a +2 to ordering people around. This does not apply to her minions, they know their place."
passive,Celestine,"Serve Me Well, Slave",,,"At the start of combat a “Pathetic Little Minion Spawner” is placed in the middle of the combat area (or as close to the middle as possible). It cannot be moved or interfered with by anyone except Celestine. On her turn, a single “Pathetic Little Minion” is spawned in the circle.  It has 10 movement, 1 Stamina, and deals 1 damage. There is no limit to how many minions she can have and their actions can be combined to attempt to be better. In addition Celestine may pay 1 Stamina as a bonus action on her turn to attempt to reduce their worthlessness and give them a very small buff of her choice. 10 - You Are Doing Adequately - For every round a minion survives in combat Celestine can give them a small buff. 19 - You Really Shouldn’t Disappoint Your Queen - Minions summoned have summoning protection for 1 round as long as they stay in the summoning circle. Meaning they cannot be damaged by anything that is inside the summoning circle when they are summoned. (From Queen Worthless):  Let’s Get Down To Business - Pathetic Little Minions have been going to karate class or something. They now deal 2 damage, have 2 stamina and explode for an extra 1 damage. Minion Multiplier - Celestine is really trying to get better with being considerate to her minions. Up to X times per combat she can roll a d2 when summoning minions. X is equal to the amount of buffs she has given to her minions this session. Her movement has also increased by 1. The Geraldic Continuum - Whenever Celestine has minions, once per round, she can choose a minion she likes the most and name them. Named minions gain a +1 to all of their rolls and this can help when they are in groups but currently does not stack with other named minion rolls. If a named minion survives until the end of a combat it may pick combat rewards, though it may only gain Stamina or Proficiency and only a maximum of 1, though others can put companionship towards minions if they want, though only from combat rewards. Named minions that survive a combat now have 3 lives with which to live and die after their third life has ended. Once per combat per named minion when summoning minions with her passive specifically she can choose to instead summon a named minion, she may not summon minions who have a stat total higher than her proficiency, minions start at 1 prof. Minions do not gain proficiency when they crit."
ability,Celestine,Wrath of the Worthless,2,,"Normally I’d just have my minions do the fighting for me, but, since I was given this cool sword… I suppose I might as well use it!  Celestine channels her power, causing her blade to glow a bright gold, and charges forward up to 3 spaces and swings the Sword of Damocles in a wide arc, dealing 4 damage to targets in a 3 space wide line in front of her.  The sword is really heavy though, so this ability has a -2 to its roll… unless of course, she has her minions to help her.  Minions that are within 2 spaces of her when she makes the attack can automatically assist her, giving her a +2 to the roll for each one nearby, and if she rolls a 16 or higher (buffs included), the minions can make free attacks against one of the hit targets as well."
ability,Celestine,Regal (?) Presence,3,,"I am a real queen...princess? No, Queen, definitely queen. Now bow before my regal presence, peasant! Celestine picks a target and orders them to bow before her, the target feels no actual power acting upon them to do so other than the feeling of not wanting to disappoint a child. The target can choose to bow or not bow. If they bow they may not move from that spot until the end of their next turn and actions they make until the end of their next turn are all made with disadvantage. If they do not bow however, Celestine throws a tantrum and immediately goes to chop their head off with The Sword Of Damocles, it has all limitations removed, can be done from any distance and rolls with advantage. Regardless, if they target Celestine in any way until the end of their next turn she gets a free minion. Cannot target the same target multiple times in a row, she also cannot use this 2 rounds in a row. 24 - Bow Before Power - The secondary effect of The Sword Of Damocles always activates when using this ability and instead of halving movement when it procs it instead knocks the enemy prone. If the 16+ effect is activated, the minions can do their follow-up attacks with advantage on a prone target."
ability,Celestine,"Don’t Care How, I Want It Now",1,,"Minion! I’m thirsty! Get me my sippy! Celestine wants things, of course she does, she’s a spoiled child, what were you expecting? Celestine can order a singular minion to go grab a small item for her or perform a simple task at her behest. The minions are quite pathetic though, so it can’t be anything too big or complicated but it doesn’t need to be something *in* the combat area. When they complete their task Celestine may grace them by removing some of their worthlessness, granting them a small buff. This does take up the action of the minion targeted with this ability, but is used as a free action for Celestine. She can also use this ability to instead call forth another minion from her portal. (8) If Celestine calls a new minion from the portal using this ability she can have it come with something of her choice so that it doesn’t take up a minion main action to do so. However, they are pathetic and there’s a 50% they forgot or broke it somehow. Roll a d100 and call high or low to see if they did."
ability,Celestine,Protect Your Queen… Please,2!,,"I am a benevolent ruler and your *worthless* service shall not be unrewarded. Whenever anyone assists or protects Celestine in some way be it by granting her extra chances, getting in the way of an attack for her or even just dual-teching with her she will grant them a boon. The boon is actually a small Token Of The Worthless that grants the owner of one the exact type of assistance that they themselves granted Celestine. These last even after combat but Celestine must be there to activate them herself and once it is used it turns to worthless ash. Celestine can grant these thrice per round passively and can activate them twice per round actively so long as someone has one, she only rolls for and pays stamina cost on activating them."
weapon,Eva,Rusted Metal Nightmare,,,"Eva’s forearms and hands have been replaced with an experimental device that was originally a prototype designed to allow people to multitask more easily.  But for Eva, it’s just perfect for making more fun toys to play with.  When used, her arms transform into countless incredibly dense metal wires that lash out towards up to three targets within 8 spaces.  Screwed to the end of the wires are sharp, rust-covered needles, scissors, and drill bits.  They deal 2 damage to each target, though Eva can choose to forgo the damage on any target she wishes and instead heavily restrain them with the wires, preventing them from moving and lessening the effectiveness of their actions.  The roll for this attack has a +1 for each Patience token that Eva has on her, up to a maximum of +5.  When a target with a Patience token is damaged by this attack, they take 1 additional damage for each token they’re marked with, up to a maximum of 7 extra damage. If any targets hit by this attack have taken damage from this attack before, OR if she uses this on an ally, she can then spend any number of Patience tokens that are in the arena to apply one of the following options to that target, with the roll bonus and extra damage applying regardless: Inevitable (3 Tokens):  This attack cannot be countered. Remodeling (2 Tokens):  Eva warps a part of the target’s body to debilitate them, or attaches something new to it instead.  The something new can be almost anything if Eva would have access to it in her Playrooms.  She can attach these to allies, as well, and the normal requirement for needing to have damaged them previously does not apply in this case. Liquid Candy (5 Tokens):  Eva uses the rusted needles to pump drugs into the target.  The drugs give them disadvantage on their next roll, a -2 on the roll after, and a -1 on the roll after that.  In addition, until these rolls are made, the target cannot attack or harm Eva in any way, as they are filled with adoration for her. Removal (7 Tokens):  Eva removes a part of the target’s body.  It can usually be healed if necessary, but in the meantime, owch."
talent,Eva,Strange Resiliance,,,"Eva doesn’t feel pain the way most people do.  Instead of intense flashes, it’s a long and drawn-out sting.  This doesn’t affect the amount of damage dealt to her, but it does affect the way she reacts to it.  Eva can have her bones broken, get impaled by a spear, or even get shot in the skull and still keep going like nothing happened.  Debilitating physical effects like this only affect her in minor ways, and she is also immune to fear or mind-control effects of any kind, as her brain is incapable of being controlled or afraid.  "
passive,Eva,The Playrooms,,,"The space between all spaces, where all the lost things go to never be found again.  An unused storage room, an abandoned office, even underneath your bed, any place in existence that is unobserved or easy to miss can be a potential gateway to The Playrooms, a dimension of infinite twisting hallways, nonsensical architecture, and strange beings that most would rather not meet.  This dimension came into existence the moment Eva’s epithet took hold, and it follows Eva wherever she goes.  At any time, she can enter The Playrooms through either a door she created or an abandoned, unobserved space that she finds.  Eva can squeeze into any unobserved space no matter how small it is, even a millimeter-wide crack in the wall if she must, and enter The Playrooms through there.  Inside the Playrooms, any beings that reside there normally will obey her without question, and ‘Was This… Here?  Before?’ becomes a zero cost ability that can be used three times per round that rolls with double advantage.  There are many spaces within the Playrooms that do not conform to the laws of time, space, or the laws of physics, and Eva can choose to become immune to any of those effects if she wishes.  "
passive,Eva,Collapsation of Certainty,,,"Eva’s epithet is immensely unstable and constantly twists reality in the space around it in the same way it has twisted Eva’s mind.  Any ‘space’ Eva occupies that can be defined using certain, unambiguous terms, such as a room, a house, a city, or even the world, becomes the ‘threshold’ at which her epithet will hold dominion.  While contained to a specific space, such as a room on the inside of a building, reality will only be warped within that area.  But if she were to exit this space and go into an outdoor area, reality will slowly continue twisting infinitely outwards until there is no longer a difference between inside and out, upside or down, past or future, alive or dead.  "
passive,Eva,Purgatory,,,"For each turn that Eva does not take a main action, she can choose to either mark one target of her choice with two ‘Patience’ tokens, mark two targets with one Patience token each,, or mark herself with two.  She is also marked with one Patience token whenever she takes damage."
ability,Eva,Was This...Here? Before?,1,,"Reality is only our perceptions of it.  Eva can manifest a door to the Playrooms on any surface she wishes while no one is looking and transport herself to a different unobserved location anywhere within the current room Eva occupies.  She can also make small environmental changes, such as shifting the shape of a room, making the lights flicker off, or creating a small obstacle of some kind.  This is a bonus action."
ability,Eva,Suspended Animation,2!,,"Eva slows the perceptions of everyone in the area as they pertain to a single object or target, causing them to appear to be moving much slower than they actually are.  This can interrupt attacks or make it easier to avoid certain obstacles.  A living target she uses this on will also have their perceptions slowed, but to a much more magnified extent.  They will perceive themselves and everyone else as moving much slower than normal, but whereas this only lasts a second or two for everyone else, the target will spend 1d3 weeks in this helpless state, which will mentally exhaust and drain most individuals."
ability,Eva,Fun For the Whole Family,5⛯,,"Above all, Eva simply wants to have fun.  Her arms split apart into countless wires, even more than usual, and she then moves up to her movement through the area, basic attacking every target she chooses who comes into her range as she does so while Eva smiles and twirls happily.  These attacks each deal +2 damage, pierce through most kinds of barriers or physical DR, and Eva can apply Patience effects with these attacks as normal.  Once per combat.  "
weapon,Ingrid,Will o’ the Wisps,,,"Ingrid commands the wandering souls around her to attack a nearby enemy. Has 4 range and 3 damage at base, but every basic attack landed on someone increases the damage they take from it by 1. 53. The Wisps Will It, You Can’t Stop Them, Don’t Look at Me - Will of the Wisps not only has its cooldown removed, but Ingrid can also expend stacks of them to give an equivalent minus to an afflicted unit’s roll as an anytime action."
talent,Ingrid,Ghost Eat Ghost World,,,"As what is essentially a ghost, Ingrid is immune to all fear based effects, and can talk with teammates even when knocked out."
passive,Ingrid,Negative Guard,,,"Ingrid’s Epithet makes it so her life is essentially always in the negatives. Using abilities does not take stamina, and whenever she takes damage, it is reduced to one unless the base damage would be enough to kill her. To her, being killed is like being “knocked out”, meaning that she must be reduced to -15 at base. Similarly, killing her for good would be achieved by reducing her stamina to -30. Stamina rewards she receives are always reduced to 1, making the thresholds for “killing her” decrease by one each. Less Of This, Please, I’m Begging You - If an ongoing buff/debuff or other effect is taking place, so long as Ingrid is either affected by it or adjacent to someone affected by it, she can attempt to use her action to remove as much of the effect as she so chooses, leaving the rest intact. The Absence Of Heat Does Wonders - If an enemy has been hit by either Will O’ The Wisps or Sub-Zero Chills, and the next damage they take comes from the opposite, the attack staggers the hit opponent, dealing 1 extra damage and giving them a -3 on their next action."
ability,Ingrid,Sub-Zero Chills,0!,,"Ingrid lets out an icy exhale, as she and the space she is standing on are covered in ice. The ice around her quickly dissipates, but the ice on the space remains. At the start of each of her turns, the ice extends once space in each of the four cardinal directions. Anyone besides Ingrid that physically touches the ice takes 2 damage upon first contact, another 2 at the start of their turns while still standing on the ice, and have their movements, on turns they start on the ice, halved. Once per round. 29. Ice Breaker - As a 1 stamina bonus action on her turn, Ingrid can cause all ice created from Sub-Zero Chills to shatter, dealing 4 damage to anyone standing on the ice, 2 to everyone adjacent to an ice tile (that isn’t already standing on it). If the ice has extended past its base, everyone hit by it has disadvantage on their next roll."
ability,Ingrid,Reverse Polarity,0,,"Ingrid takes a number of something, either in the world around her or something from a sheet that she has seen, and slaps a “-” in front of that number. This number is changed to its inverse for 1d2 rounds. She can not use this ability on itself."
ability,Ingrid,"Eh, Could’ve Been Worse",0!,,"Using this ability, Ingrid can either cause something that just occurred to either slightly worsen in quality, or perform an action that previously occurred in the combat but worse. Once per round. 46. Embarrassing Memories - If Ingrid can bring up a specific example of how something has been done “worse” in past combats/sessions she has been in with Eh, Could’ve Been Worse, she rolls with advantage and can cause said version of the action to occur to a tee."
ability,Ingrid,At a Disadvantage,0,,"Ingrid creates some sort of roadblock or effect that would inflict a penalty or “minus” onto the roll for a particular type of action. The effect is up to her, but it cannot be the same thing more than once in a combat. More specifically, the exact effect cannot be done twice, although different effects can be done to produce the same minus. 35. She Giveth, She Taketh Away - When creating an effect with At a Disadvantage, Ingrid can now make it so an effect gives a buff to a different type of roll that it is related to the roll type it is primarily debuffing. The buff is typically weaker than the debuff, but multitasking sure can be useful."
ability,Ingrid,Positives And Negatives,,,"By focusing the negative energy within herself, Ingrid can simultaneously increase the positive energy in someone else. In other words, she can debuff one of her own stats by a given amount to increase someone else’s equivalent stat by the same amount. If she reduces herself to 0 in any stat, she takes one damage at the start of her turns, and she can cancel this effect at any time as a free action."
weapon,Itsy,Teeny Tiny Little Nibble,,,"Smiling cutely, Itsy sinks her fangs into someone in melee range, dealing 5 damage to them and healing herself for 2 Stamina.  Once per combat per target, she can keep the taste of their blood in mind, which counts for one of the three categories in her passive of her choosing."
ability,Itsy,String Orchestra,2,,"Itsy weaves a web in a 5x5 area of her choosing.  This web halves the movement of enemies who walk on it and is very difficult to remove.  Allies who stand on her web, however, are not slowed and instead have a +2 to their rolls and -1 to ability costs.  These bonuses do not stack with other bonuses they’re receiving.  If Itsy spends 5 Stamina on this ability, it rolls with advantage and can be used as a bonus action.  When someone steps on it, the strings vibrate slightly and produce music and colors that reflect the person’s soul.  Whenever someone posts a part of their kit while standing on these webs, the energy of their soul reverberates through the web, and Itsy ‘observes’ it with her passive.  This can only happen once per round, per target, per web.  The webs can be overlapped. Marking Territory - When combat begins, Itsy can immediately put down one of her ‘String Orchestra’ webs in an area of her choosing. Nice And Tidy~ - The webs Itsy creates with ‘String Orchestra’ ignore the effects of most other ground hazards and can even eliminate them entirely on good rolls."
ability,Itsy,All The Colors Of You,3,,"Itsy dashes forward up to 4 spaces and swiftly kicks or punches an enemy target, dealing 7 damage to them and knocking them back two spaces.  In addition, epithetical energy seethes through their body, and a colorful liquid made of their soul splashes out of their body up to 2 spaces away in the same direction they were knocked back.  If it lands on one of Itsy’s webs, then once per combat per target, she can count that as ‘observing’ something of theirs with her passive, and she also heals for 2 Stamina.  If the liquid lands on one of her allies, they heal for 4 Stamina."
ability,Itsy,Weirdwebs,1!,,"Itsy concentrates for a moment, closing her eyes, and attempts to hear a target’s thoughts.  This rolls with advantage if she has already ‘observed’ the target with her passive once during this combat.  If she uses this during her own turn, Itsy can get a vague idea of the target’s future plans, debuffing those actions somewhat unless something happens that changes those plans before their turn.  She can also use it in response to attacks made against her to attempt to dodge them.  In addition, she can use this ability on an ally to communicate with them telepathically for the rest of combat, meaning if she uses it on them again she can potentially warn them of incoming attacks.  They are able to answer her as well. Once per Round."
weapon,Jasper,Knockout Blow!,,,"5 Damage, 1 Range. Nothing fancy, just a quick attack however Jasper feels like delivering it. She may choose to sacrifice damage for knockback at a 1:1 ratio on this attack."
weapon,Jasper,Furious Kicks,,,"4 Damage, 1 Range. Jasper unleashes a flurry of multiple kicks at her opponent, her legs moving almost too fast to see."
weapon,Jasper,Rushing Wyvern,,,"5 Damage, 1 Range. A quick but strong strike, often made with fingers or toes, intended to jab at a target’s vitals and incapacitate them."
weapon,Jasper,Breaking Blow,,,"4 Damage, 1 Range. A punch designed to shatter bones, plain and simple. Though, it requires a significant amount of power to wield effectively."
talent,Jasper,Master Gambler,,,"Well, Jasper had to find some way to make money while she was out traveling the world, and through a lot of experience and some natural talent she found that she was quite simply amazing at gambling. Whenever it comes to making some kind of wager or gamble (not including effects from Dealer Stance), Jasper may roll with advantage, triple advantage if it’s a traditional game you would find at a casino."
talent,Jasper,Iron Will,,,"Though she may not be the most skilled, Jasper has studied many different martial disciplines, and has developed a strong mind and body as a result. She has resistance to any charm, fear, or other mind altering effects, and has an easier time dispelling most status ailments or other negative effects."
passive,Jasper,Lifeline Slots,,,"Everything in life is a gamble, and this stance exemplifies that more than any other. Whenever Jasper uses her basic attack or an ability, she rolls an additional d20 that can apply a number of effects depending on the roll. Unless otherwise specified, these effects always happen, regardless of the success of her action. Bad Luck (1-3): Sorry, it seems the dice just weren’t in your favor this time. No additional effect is added. Locked Out (4-6): Jasper’s ki wrapping around and restricting the target, one ability or basic attack on their sheet becomes unavailable for the next round, chosen at random. Slot Respin (7): Roll again for a new effect! Something good might happen if you roll three 7’s in a row… Booster Pack (8-11): Gain +1 to ability and basic attack rolls for the remainder of combat. This can stack on itself. The Ol’ One-Two (12): Speed and action is your friend on the battlefield. You gain an additional main action for this turn only. Hit ‘em with a Bang (13-14): Upon being hit, energy explodes out of the target, applying the attack to everyone of Jasper’s choosing within 1 space of the target! Double Cherry (15-16): Delicious and nutritious! You recoup the cost of your ability (maximum of 5 stamina) and heal another target of your choice for the same amount. This can even overheal! (If this triggers on basic attack, it heals 1 stamina). Hey, what about that Guy? (17-19): Jasper’s ki manifests away from her body, as another target chosen at random also gets hit! If there is only one valid target on the field, they’ll be affected twice (enemies for attacks, allies for support abilities). Lucky Lucky! (20): Wow, lucky you! Immediately gain 1 proficiency, and increase your action’s success level (crit fail/fail to success, success to crit success, crit success to double crit success, etc.)."
passive,Jasper,Battlefield Blur,,,"Jasper takes a stance allowing for quick movement and decisive action in a fight. She has +3 movement, can move-act-move, and may continue to take actions so long as they keep succeeding, though damage will proliferate as she does more actions in a turn."
passive,Jasper,Dance of the Dragons,,,"Jasper adopts a slightly more peculiar stance as her ki wraps around her arms, seeming to take an appearance similar to chinese dragons. Whenever she makes an attack, Jasper may spend one extra stamina to have the dragon ki bite down, dealing 2 damage and pulling the target into a grapple. From here she may either keep the target held or immediately throw them away as a bonus action."
passive,Jasper,Path of the Elemental,,,"Dragons are elemental beings at their core, and with your ki you can bring out some of that potential. Choose an element, it can be just about anything you can think of from fire to acid to metal to sound, or whatever else strikes your fancy. You now have resistance to damage and general effects regarding that element, and can tune any of your ki attacks in Wyvern stance to deal damage of that element instead of physical. Element - Fire"
passive,Jasper,HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!,,,"Pure, raw, unhindered strength. That is what this stance embodies. While in this stance Jasper’s movement is decreased to 4, however her ki makes her stronger, and she can continue to increase that strength. On her turn, she may sacrifice her movement action in order to increase her damage by +1, or she may roll to attempt to do so as a bonus action. Furthermore, compared to other stances it is much harder to forcibly move Jasper."
ability,Jasper,Hidden Ace,2,,"Sometimes the best way to win a gamble is simply to cheat, but is it really cheating if you don’t get caught? Jasper may choose one target on the field; their next action is guaranteed to be at least an average success. If Jasper uses this on herself, instead of it’s normal effect Lifeline Slots does not trigger, but the next time it does it is rolled three times, applying all relevant effects at once. Bonus action."
ability,Jasper,Secret Dealing,3,,"Jasper secretly rolls a d13 for each of her enemies on the field, and sends the results to an ally as confirmation. The next time the relevant enemy rolls that number, Jasper may immediately run up to them and use an ability or basic attack targeting them."
ability,Jasper,Final Gambit,X⛯,,"The cost of this ability is equal to Jasper’s remaining stamina. For every stamina point spent on this, she may move towards an enemy and make a single 3 damage attack against them. This ability itself does not trigger Lifeline Slots, but each attack from it does. She may only receive healing through Double Cherry once and Lucky Lucky! may only grant proficiency once while this ability is active. If the ability fails, the cost is 5 stamina. Once per Session."
ability,Jasper,Bicycle Kicks,1,,"Jasper does a quick cartwheel backwards, dealing two instances of 3 damage and knocking the target into the air. While airborne, the next attack that hits them will have increased knockback, and they will take some extra damage if knocked into a wall or object that would stop their movement."
ability,Jasper,Nimble Movements,1!,,"Reacting to her opponents, Jasper quickly ducks and dodges out of the way of a series of attacks, moving up to 4 spaces away in the process. Once per round."
ability,Jasper,Slam Down,1,,"Jasper lifts her leg high into the air, before slamming it down on a target. This deals 4 damage and forces the target prone, making them spend half their movement to get back up. This ability is an automatic success against targets that are already prone or otherwise on the ground."
ability,Jasper,Dragon's Fang,1,,"Reaching out, Jasper sends her dragons forward to bite down on a target and grab them, dealing 6 damage and either pulling them to her or pulling herself to them. When she was learning this form she was told that this technique was strangely cursed, but that’s not gonna stop her from using it!"
ability,Jasper,Counter Blow,2!,,"With expert movements and quick thinking, Jasper can quickly push an attack to the side and respond with her own while her opponent is left open. If this ability successfully blocks or reduces damage from an attack, Jasper may immediately use her basic attack in response."
ability,Jasper,Wyvern's Breath,3,,"Bringing her hands together and focusing, Jasper sends her raw ki out like a dragon’s breath, dealing 6 damage to enemies in a roughly 45 degree cone 4 spaces out. If this attack is successful, Dragon’s Fang may be used immediately after."
ability,Jasper,-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!,1,,"Jasper continues to charge her ki up as much as she can. Success on this ability gives her another stack for her passive, as well as pushes anyone adjacent to her back 2 spaces from her sheer force."
ability,Jasper,Overpower,3!,,"Jasper sees an attack coming for her, and attempts to quite literally overpower it with an attack of her own. On a success this not only deals her basic attack damage to the target, but also deals extra damage equal to the damage they would have dealt. (damage scales with level of success)"
ability,Jasper,Power Wave,3⛯,,"Focusing all of the power she’s gained into her palms, Jasper sends forth a massive beam of energy. This is a 3xInfinite line attack, dealing 4 damage at base and pushing all targets within back 5 spaces, however power increases from her passive apply double to this attack, and she loses all stacks afterwards. Once per combat."
passive,Leah,Alchemy But With Computers,,,"Hacking and programming is an especially mysterious and eldritch form of high witchcraft, and Leah puts this to good use to create useful items from nothing but lines of code and computer data.  It's sort of like cryptocurrency, but it actually creates something real and useful, and isn't an active detriment to human society.  Leah's red stat is ‘Bits’, which are small fragments of data that she and her allies can collect from enemies by doing damage to them or finding out information about them.  She starts each combat with 0 Bits and has a maximum of 64.  Her Bits reset to 0 at the end of combat.  When she or her allies deal damage to an enemy, small red Bits equal to the damage dealt that only Leah can see with her special glasses are expunged from their being and land in random adjacent spaces to them.  If they were damaged with a melee attack, the bits are automatically collected, but if they were damaged from range then someone will need to walk over the Bits to collect them for Leah.  When information is learned about an enemy that isn’t something obvious through its appearance or abilities, the GM can give Leah 3-15 Bits depending on how valuable they think the information was.  Whenever Leah collects Bits from any source, she must keep track of what that source was and assign it a relevant property - for example, if the bits came from damaging an enemy, they would likely either have properties of the enemy itself or the attack used to do so. Once Leah attains certain thresholds of Bits, she can use them to craft items for her or her allies to use.  The item she creates must use at least one property of the Bits used to create it.  Using more properties will weaken all the other properties being used, as the final product becomes diluted.  The strength of the item she creates depends on the number of Bits used, as listed below: Minor Item (8 Bits):  A simple, relatively mundane item that can only deal minor damage or provide small amounts of utility or defense. Moderate Item (16 Bits):  A decently strong item with powerful or unique properties. Major Item (32 Bits):  An item this powerful can be something directly from a video game or other piece of media that Leah would know about, something that can heavily swing the tides of a battle in her allies’ favor.  Elite Gaming God Item (64 Bits):  An item of this caliber would be truly astonishing, forever cementing the legacy of the one who uses it as a true Gamer. Dude I Love Kingdom Hearts - Whenever something happens that Leah can reference to a video game, or a piece of media that directly involves video games (such as her favorite webcomic, Nickel Gamehouse), she can reference it as such and gain 1 Bit.  If a combat starts while she has Bits earned in this way, she keeps them until the end of that combat.  Also, once per round/out of combat scene, if someone donates bits to the twitch stream, she gains 1/10th of the donated bits as Bits, rounded down."
ability,Leah,Craftilize,2,,"Using the Bits she's accumulated with her passive, Leah types rapidly on her keyboard and creates a powerful item for herself or one of her allies.  If the item can be actively used, it can be used once immediately, but doing so cannot combo into other actions.  If she rolls a natural 20 with this ability, its effectiveness is not doubled - instead, she can take another main action."
ability,Leah,Reprogram Your Face,2,,"Pushing up her glasses, Leah's fingers fly across her keyboard keys and… somehow, hack into an enemy target and begin messing with their physiology.  This deals 5 damage to them and also gives them a minor debuff to a specific kind of action for the next round."
ability,Leah,Rapid Analysis,1!,,"Leah's mind is like a steel trap, if people usually filled steel traps with anime, mobile games, and porn.  Using her expert knowledge, she shouts out advice to an ally within 5 spaces of her, potentially allowing them to dodge or counter an incoming attack."
weapon,Leo,Kitty Girl Clawz >:3,,,"Leo’s got cat scratch fever! For some reason Leo is pretty good at martial arts and with her claws on top of this she’s able to combo her targets into a bloody mess. Her ‘Kitty Martial Arts’ deals 4 damage at 1 range but leaves the hit unit with an irremovable mark that increases Leo’s (and other cat based) damage by 2 for each mark on them. After the third successful strike the marks are removed and Leo (and other cats) gain +1 crit range against them specifically forever but only for damaging actions. (Marks are removed at the end of combat).  On a roll of 12+, she can make an additional attack against the target, and this can continue chaining with itself, though the DC increases by 2 each time, and only one mark can be applied per turn. 14 - Kitty Cat Dash! - When making a basic attack with her “Kitty Clawz >:3” Leo can move exactly one space if she wishes as she makes the attack but not after."
weapon,Leo,Yin Yarn Blast~!,,,"This basic attack takes the form of a ball with a little kitty face made of special energy, known as ‘Ki’, that deals 5 damage at 5 range and on rolls of 11+ makes the target just… want to attack this dumbass fucking cat.  Any actions they take during their next turn that are not targeting Leo have a +2 to their cost, even if they did not have a cost in the first place (this does not apply to moving). Also they are now distracted by string and fast- moving objects for the next 2 rounds."
talent,Leo,Burning Heart,,,"Leo’s got the inner strength of a lion and the power of her heart is unyielding! The third time Leo gets hit by the same unit in combat her burning heart literally catches them on fire dealing an immediate 2 damage and then 1d2 at the start of their turns, this is hard to remove. Leo has no idea where this fire is coming from and is absolutely not terrified of this at all."
passive,Leo,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,,,"Combat is scary!  The enemies are scary!  EVERYTHING IS SCARY!  Leo is almost constantly running around the combat arena at high speeds, screaming and mewling like a scared little kitty girl.  At the start of every turn on initiative that is not her own, Leo must move a number of spaces equal to her movement speed - and since everyone knows it’s impossible for catgirls to run with their eyes open, she moves only in random directions.  These directions are chosen by rolling Xd8, where X is equal to her movement, and then moving in those directions in sequence. However, a combination of unusual luck with her overbearing… catgirl-isms allows Leo to interact with potential attacks and hazards in strangely beneficial ways.  If her random movement would cause her to run into a terrain hazard such as fire or a pit of spikes, for example, she can make a roll to try and have something cartoonishly stupid happen instead that benefits her team, such as rolling around and putting out the fire with her dumb torso or somehow landing over the spike pit in a manner that makes a bridge.  If she moves in such a way that would cause her to collide with an enemy or ally, they each might take minor damage or knockback as a result, or some other stupid effect such as Leo landing on top of them in the style of a high school romance anime. The GM determines the exact outcome of these effects. In addition to this, whenever Leo is attacked while it isn’t her turn, she automatically gets to make a dodge roll to contest the enemy’s roll.  She can still take moderate damage even if her roll is higher, but some other kind of stupid effect might happen to debilitate the enemy in some way, such as their dagger getting stuck in her body, causing them to lose it for a time. 11 - Battle Cry! - At the exact start of the next initiative turn after Leo’s turn specifically, before anything else can happen, Leo lets loose a terrible “battle” scream that deals 2 sonic damage to everyone adjacent to her."
ability,Leo,"O-Oh Nyooo, Don’t *Kill* Me!  UmU",1!,,"Leo does something so irresistibly annoying and disruptive that the enemy switches the current target of their attack to her instead.  Even if other anytimes or Leo’s passive are used to mitigate the attack, Leo will still take minor damage from this, but even if it’s completely successful, the attack made against her will only be half as effective as usual.  "
ability,Leo,Just You W-Wait.  I-I’ll Get You Good! *points aggressively*,2,,"Leo musters up as much courage as she can for this upcoming attack - this is it, her chance to prove she isn’t a coward!  She yells a fierce battle cry and leaps across the arena towards the enemy - and completely chickens out at the last second, ending her movement 3 spaces away from the enemy target.  However, she manages to be convincing (and obnoxious) enough to cause the enemy to react as though she was actually going to attack them, forcing them to use one of their anytimes in response, and its cost is increased by 1.  This anytime will only be minorly effective if it does anything at all.  This anytime’s use limitations do not refresh until the end of Leo’s next turn.  If the target doesn’t have any anytime abilities, then some other kind of disruptive effect of the GMs choice will occur, such as the target tripping and falling prone.  "
ability,Leo,Lion Giga Slash,3,,"Time for my ultimate attack!  Leo rushes towards an enemy target up to her movement speed, brandishing her claws - but she gets scared along the way and closes her eyes before she makes the attack.  If successful, this attack deals 7 damage to that target and knocks them prone.  However, this ability also places ‘marks’ on the target in the same way Leo’s ‘Kitty Girl Clawz’ attack does.  If this ability would put the target up to three marks, the marks explode in a bloody cacophony, dealing 13 additional damage to them and restoring 25% of Leo’s maximum Stamina (rounded down).  This healing is halved each time it occurs during the same combat.   "
weapon,Liriala,Lampwand,,,"Liriala harnesses the lamp-y moth-y powers present in her wand and fires out several small wisps of fire. They deal 2+1d4 of damage to a target within 3 range. 32:  Liriala can can increase its range by +2. 50 - Choose One: Liriala can now target an extra unit with her weapon range with Lampwand, splitting the damage as she wishes."
talent,Liriala,Fluffy is Heroic!,,,"Liriala’s a super duper fluffy moth gorl uwu~ And of course, with all of this fluffy wuffy going on she gains 1DR vs all Physical Damage. 56 - Liriala does not take fall damage, in addition, her 1DR vs physical becomes 2DR vs Physical and 1DR vs everything else except fire. Once per round if Liriala were to take damage from a fire based attack, she can roll to nullify that damage completely but she gains up to 5 flame stacks immediately depending on the strength of the attack. Finally, any ally can hug her to transfer buffs or debuffs to her as a free action on their turn and she heals for 3 stamina."
talent,Liriala,What Goes Up!,,,"Liriala may fly freely...But only up to 10ft above the ground. 42 - Learning from Naomi and all those movies they watch sometimes, when Liriala is flying she can spend 1 flame to remove the limitations on flight as jet-like flames are released from the bottom of her feet and she gains 2 movement while flying. Though she must keep spending a flame every round she is airborne above the limit."
passive,Liriala,Lomp,,,"The Lampwand that Liriala keeps with her burns ever brighter as she keeps fighting! Every stamina she spends on an ability, she gains 1 Flame stat, up to a maximum of 10. She blanks out mysteriously whenever she gets to 10...Ever since her original companion (a big ol forest moth) passed, the flames have been way more purple/black. She may use these flames to add 1 to her basic attack damage (up to a maximum of 6) and light a fire to her abilities...For whatever reason she can come up with. 39 - When Liriala spends flames on a turn she can choose to condense those flames into a more effective blaze. When doing so she can add +2 to her basic attack damage per flame (up to a maximum of 6) and can add extra effects to each of her abilities based on this. However, for her next 2 turns after this she cannot spend flames and she gains double the flames from stamina costs."
ability,Liriala,*munch munch munch*,1,,"Liriala munches a whole bunch of cotton and spits it out at a target for...No damage. But it does restrict and slow them a decent bit! Only deals minor damage on high rolls. 30 - Liriala is a bit tooo hungy and munches just a little tiny bit of her hero outfit, oops~ When she does this she can add any buffs, debuffs or status effects affecting her, removing them, and applying them to the cotton she spits out. If she spits it at allies it’ll buff them in some way and if spat at an enemy it’ll debuff them in some way, depending on what she ate. If she has any natural form of buff from her kit it comes back at the end of her next turn. 39 - Liriala can spend 2 of her flame stat to turn the spat cotton into a ball of flame, that not only has the same effects as it normally would but also hits the target with a cursed burn effect that deals 1d4 at the start of the targets turn and they have disadvantage to all resistance checks while it is afflicted. If Liriala spends an extra flame she can make this a bonus action to use."
ability,Liriala,Like Moths!,2,,"Liriala summons forth her moth-y friends to surround a target. They’re technically magical moths so they don’t die. This is important because they float around the target, functioning as a 5 stamina barrier against ranged attacks, and being able to carry the target...A little bit. Only 5ft above the ground normally, or simple levitation is all that is possible. 39 - Liriala can spend up to 3 flames to increase the stamina of the barrier by 2 for each flame and it works against melee attacks. If they are attacked by melee the attacker gets burned for 1d4 damage."
ability,Liriala,Lunar Legends,3,,"The arena is lit up in purifying moonlight, dealing 3 damage to any “Evil” targets on the field and revealing any stealthed units temporarily. The damage decreases as it gets used a lot. 23:  I’m gonna do my very BEST. When Liriala uses her purifying moonlight, on slightly higher rolls this also heals all of Liriala’s allies for 1 stamina, but not herself. This effect becomes slightly harder the more it is used. 37 - Moon powers activate!~ Liriala can condense all of the purifying moonlight energy into a single 3x3 area, this deals the amount of damage and healing it would have dealt without being condensed into this area, enemies are damaged for that much and allies are healed by that much. If she pays an extra 3 stamina at the beginning of her turns she can have it strike down again in a 3x3 area of her choosing without needing to roll. This ability can now be used to heal herself. 39 - Liriala can spend up to 9 of her flames to create as many beacons for lunar light beams to appear. She places these around the arena as she wishes. As an anytime action she can activate these beacons by spending 1 stamina and cause a 1x1 Lunar Legends to strike down within a 3x3 area centred on a flame and deal 5 damage to enemies or heal 5 stamina for an ally. She can only activate 1 of these beacons per turn, she is also able to move one of the beacons up to 3 spaces once per turn. These stay around even if Xhira is brought out but she can only use them to deal damage, unless she is feeling particularly nice."
ability,Liriala,Chrysalis,3!,,"Liriala has various chrysalis...i on her person at all times. These can only be given to enemies as a sign of friendship. It restores their health by 1 on the start of their turn and makes all of their rolls have +1 to them. If they get rid of them, Liriala gets very sad and has advantage against them for the rest of the combat. 45 - Why Don’t They Want To Be Friends!? ;n; - Someone rejecting one of Liriala’s chrysali of friendship makes her really sad and a liiiitle bit angy. Every third time she is rejected using this ability a little bit of dark purple flame manifests around her and by adding 1 to her red stat she may force the target to take the Chrysalis but it is corrupted so they no longer gain the Fast Healing or buff to rolls they now take 1 damage at the start of their turns and have a -1 to their rolls. The chrysalis may not be removed through normal methods and if a unit dies to the damage of the chrysalis or they are a mook that gets knocked out, they get wrapped up as though affected by Xhira’s “Hatch” but only hatch once Xhira takes control. If Xhira does not take control in the same combat they will appear the next time she does. Once per combat if she is feeling particularly….spiteful, Liriala may force this ability to succeed by adding 3 to her red stat and paying an extra stamina."
weapon,Xhira,THAT’S NO WAY TO TREAT A FRIEND!,,,"Xhira takes her bladed wings and stabs them into a target adjacent to her before throwing them up to 3 spaces away for 5 total damage. 32:  Xhira can either choose to have the option to decrease her passive by 1 to double the throwing distance of her THAT’S NO WAY TO TREAT A FRIEND! and increase it’s damage by 1.5x rounding up. 50 - Xhira’s basic attack is now a 3 range melee attack where she dashes up to a target before attacking them. Xhira can leave one of her bladed wings in the target, this deals 1 damage every turn it is in there and, as a dark energy connects the two of them, Xhira either heals for 1 every turn they take damage from that wing or she adds 1 to her red stat every turn they take damage from that wing. The wing is very easy to remove however. "
talent,Xhira,MUST COME DOWN!,,,Targets flying in some way or otherwise directly above Xhira in any way function like they are in range of all abilities and attacks of Xhira. 42 - Xhira can spend 2 flames to increase her movement by 1.5x for the round and if an enemy is adjacent to her during one of these rounds they take 1 damage per turn they are adjacent to her as their being starts to turn to ash.
talent,Xhira,"If You Touch Me, I Will Eat You!",,,"Xhira is…..not...so fluffy. Her fluffy wuffys become edgy and sharp. She loses her DR but whenever she is dealt Physical Damage, the attacker is dealt 1 damage back automatically. 56 - Once per round, if Xhira is hit by a melee attack she may immediately retaliate with her basic attack with 1:1 lifesteal. Don’t say she didn’t warn you."
passive,Xhira,Dark Side of the Moon,,,"Liriala’s “other half” of sorts is what remains of Xhira. She too has a red stat, Flames. One gets consumed at the start of her turns. They go away at the end of combat, she starts with 10, and can use it to light herself aflame in terrifying purple fire. This primarily works as a fear-inducing mechanism and something for dealing extra damage to targets close to her. She may use any amount of flames in any ability, but when she runs out she returns to Liriala’s form."
passive,Xhira,Broken Moon,,,"Xhira has managed to dictate her own fate and has finally fully taken over Liriala’s body. She is now able to start to regain her old demonic strength back once again although the aesthetic of this may be slightly more….mothy...than she might want. In addition she now gains an additional 2 movement, flight up to 15ft, all of her non-DoT damage is increased by 1 and when she makes a successful basic attack she may take a single follow up action that is weakened in some way (it can not be “Eclipse”), once per turn. Finally, whenever she critically succeeds she gains an Abyssal Mark that appears somewhere on her body in the shape of a black crescent moon. These automatically activate if she is on the receiving end of a critical success covering her body in a void-like blackness temporarily, not only allowing her to reduce the effectiveness of the crit by 25% (making a 2x effect a 1.5x effect) but also allowing her to transfer a mirror image of the mark to that target increasing her critical hit range by 1 for each mark on a unit like this but also increasing her critical hit range by a further 1 against those units specifically. Marks on herself last until they are transferred or the end of the session and marks on other units last until Xhira crits against them, they get KO’d, death or until the end of the session (this even persists if the mark is not dealt with and the unit is no longer a part of the session)."
ability,Xhira,Dine on Flesh,3,,"Xhira pounces on a target within 4 range with a flap of her wings and pushes them to the floor, clawing out a part of their soul and feasting upon it mercilessly for a few moments, dealing 6 total damage. She gains a large property of them, or an ability on notably a high roll. She may keep 1 property of her choosing from anyone for the duration of the session (not going away when combat ends), replaceable with any other property at any time. 30: When Xhira bites upon the flesh of a target she heals for 1-3 stamina back depending on the roll."
ability,Xhira,TO A FLAME!,3,,"As a Free Action, Xhira creates a flame-like sigil above her, enchanting all enemies within a 5x5 area around her. As they are distracted with this hypnotic sight, Xhira has advantage if attacking anyone enchanted. It goes away at the end of her turn. She can alternatively use an action to create a massive fiery explosion in the same aura for 4 damage to everyone within, pardoning herself. Any enemies can’t interfere with anytimes due to the enchanting light."
ability,Xhira,Eclipse,2,,"The entire arena goes dark, with only the moon illuminating the place (even if it’s day or inside). After a while, Xhira erupts in a far larger, more moth-strous form before diving down on a target and bringing them into a painful, black abyss. This deals 8 damage to them and removes them from combat completely until their next turn. A fear effect is given to those adjacent to her. 23:  You shall all fall to my power! When the target of this ability returns from the black abyss every other enemy in combat takes 1 damage that ignores DR."
ability,Xhira,Hatch,0,,"Passive Effect. The Chrysalis’ wrap around the targets. Bosses take around 5 damage and suffer a slight movement penalty and hints of damage until the Chrysalis is removed, while mooks are completely wrapped up in the thing and violently shift and transform into a moth like creature with properties of the consumed person. They follow Xhira’s commands, and leave before Liriala can properly get back control. If the boss would die to the Chrysalis, the same effect happens. 45 - If You Don’t Wish To Be Under My Thumb, Then You Can Suffer At My Hands - When a chrysalis hatches it now deals 10 damage to players or bosses and their movement is reduced by 1 for the rest of combat. In addition Xhira can choose to either make that damage irreducible and force them to listen to a single command of hers once per combat OR she can have them take 2 damage at the start of their turns for the rest of combat and Xhira heals for that much."
ability,Xhira,"Oh Good, Pretty *And* Delicious",2,,"A delicious meal conveniently appears in the combat arena. It’s one of the other units in combat. Xhira picks one of the units in combat who is 5-9 spaces away from her; only one person may be marked like this. As a once per turn anytime action she can move one space towards that target this can be used to dodge attacks and even if she rolls badly to dodge or anytime usage is limited in some way, she will move that one space if she uses this. Once she is adjacent to that target she may use Dine On Flesh as a free action on that target specifically. But if she doesn’t do it the first time she goes adjacent to them she has to reset that targeting."
weapon,Luminox,Weight of all That Is,,,"Luminox steps on a single adjacent target for 4 damage. If she pays an extra stamina she puts a little bit more extra force into it, cracking the ground and creating a shockwave of galaxy blue fire all around herself that deals 3 damage to all adjacent enemies and pushing them back 3 spaces, except the one stepped on who is pinned prone under her foot. 19 - Meteorite Step - If Luminox is 4 or more spaces in the air and she attempts to step on a unit that directly below her she rolls with advantage and deals double damage. You Proceed To Have Your Way With Her Again (+2) - Enemies hit by Luminox’s “*Weight Of All That Is*” gain an extra Starlight."
talent,Luminox,You Proceed To Have Your Way With Her Again,,,Luminox now has double advantage when seducing single women.
talent,Luminox,All Of History… Sort Of,,,"Luminox knows the entire history of the universe that she has seen or destroyed as of 10,000 years ago. This knowledge isn’t particularly useful since it doesn’t cover the most recent 10,000 years but it does allow Luminox to look at objects that are considered ancient technology, magical or artefacts and discern what use it has and how to use it. If she requires a roll, it is done so with advantage. You may think that’s the end of it, but also she gains +1 movement."
passive,Luminox,Moonflower Blooms,,,"Energy that feels like the universe itself coalesced into a single spark of Starlight. Every time an enemy is hit with one of Luminox’s attacks or abilities they gain a stack of Starlight. When an enemy has 3 stacks of Starlight the Starlight itself becomes a bud that is exceedingly hard to be removed except by Luminox, an enemy with a Starlight Bud takes 2 damage at the start of their turns. When an enemy has 6 stacks of Starlight the Starlight Bud blooms into a Moonflower a transcendent and ethereal blue flower, it now cannot be removed except by Luminox, an enemy with a Moonflower takes 3 damage at the start of their turns and Luminox heals for that amount. 17 - Cosmic Seedling - At the start of combat, Luminox may designate 1 target in combat, they immediately gain 1 stack of Starlight. In addition on her turn she may spend 1 stamina to attempt to have the Starlight on an enemy multiply, giving a unit another stack. She must roll for this."
passive,Luminox,Big Dragon Wings,,,She can fly. That’s the whole passive. This passive cannot be negated or removed.
ability,Luminox,Cosmic Gardening,2,,The veil that surrounds Luminox begins to flutter as small sparkles of blue energy fly out and immediately increase the growth rate of all Starlight’s within 3 spaces to the next stage. This only works on units that have Starlight stacks or Starlight Buds on them and cannot be used multiple rounds in a row.
ability,Luminox,Starstream,2,,"Luminox’s body glows a soft blue before she fires a laser of pure starstuff up to 10 range and deals 4 damage to all that are hit by it. This pierces through up to 3 DR and does extremely minor knockback. 22 - Starscream [BURST] - By paying an extra stamina, Luminox can fire Starstream as an anytime action once per round (this has a separate use to using it as a main action) but it also doesn’t pierce through DR."
ability,Luminox,Plucked Like A Planetary Rose,3,,"The life of a flower is fleeting, especially the beautiful Moonflower. Luminox moves up to 3 spaces and removes up to 2 Starlight Bud’s or Moonflower’s from target’s she walks past using this ability. Targets that have Buds removed take 4 damage and targets that have Moonflower’s removed take 8 as they feel their connection to the universe fluctuate. Targets that have had Starlight Buds removed cannot be given any more Starlight for 2 rounds and targets that have had a Moonflower removed cannot gain Starlight till the end of combat. But that’s not all, Luminox may at any point in time choose to eat a Starlight Bud or Moonflower, her veil and wings start to glow while her face turns a bit flush for a moment as she absorbs its power, this costs 1 to activate unless stated otherwise and if it costs more they must all be the same resource. Every time Luminox eats a Starlight Bud or Moonflower she may add any of the following effects to her abilities or basic weapons but only to one at a time. If she adds the effect using a Bud it is until the end of combat but if she eats a Moonflower it is till the end of the session. Knockback - The chosen ability or weapon now has +1 Knockback. Can stack. Lifesteal -  The chosen ability or weapon now has +1 Lifesteal. Can stack. Multihit - 1 point of damage that the chosen ability or weapon deals is now counted as a separate hit. This stacks up to the amount of damage the chosen piece has. Costs 2 Buds or Moonflowers to activate. Damage - The chosen ability or weapon now has +1 Damage. Can stack. Piercing - The chosen ability or weapon now pierces 1DR. Can stack. Elemental - The chosen ability or weapon now has an element of Luminox’s choice applied to it. Multiple Elements cannot be stacked on the same thing. Follow-Up - The chosen ability or weapon now has “Follow-Up” applied to it. Anything with “Follow-Up” applied to it may be used after a successful 12+ action using a different ability or weapon once per round. Cannot stack and costs 3 Buds or Moonflowers to activate."
weapon,Maple,Magic Lollipop Staff,,,"With a twirl of his staff, Maple fires a blast of sweet magic at a target that causes their skin to tingle and sizzle.  4 damage, 5 range. 17 - Fizzle Fizzle - When Maple hits a unit with his sweet magic, some of that fizzing magic bursts off of the target and either causes some of his farm tiles to grow or plant more candy seeds within 3 spaces of the target. 1d2+1 split as he wishes."
talent,Maple,Arts and Candy Crafts,,,"As a swift action on his turn, Maple can create a rudimentary object out of candy and toss it to an ally of his choice.  This costs between 1 and 5 Stamina depending on how complex the object is. 13 - Tasty Treats - The candy items created by Maple can now be consumed healing for 1.5x the stamina cost required to make them as a bonus action. But not by Maple himself and not in the same round they were created."
passive,Maple,Sugar-Sweet Garden,,,"Maple loves gardening, but he also hates getting his hands dirty.  Good thing he has magic to help him!  At the start of each of Maple’s turns, he selects up to 5 unoccupied 1x1 tiles or a single unoccupied 2x3 space area to begin infusing with magic.  All the selected tiles must be within 5 spaces of him.  One round later, at the start of his next turn, the seeds he’s planted will blossom into delicious candy for the masses to enjoy!  The candy seeds, however, will not bloom if they are destroyed by someone stepping on them or by getting caught in an AOE attack of some kind that would reasonably disturb them.  Once per combat, Maple can pay 2 Stamina to surround his sweets with a sugary shield and protect them from a single instance of them being destroyed. Once the candy has blossomed, each tile of candy has 3 Stamina each, and if eaten will heal for the amount of Stamina it has remaining and also apply a random buff from the Candy List.  The ally who consumed it can roll twice on the list and pick the one they want more.  Maple can eat his own candy to restore Stamina, but will not receive the buffs.  It is a once-per-turn free action to eat an adjacent piece of candy.  If an enemy tries to eat it, they take 3 psychic damage that cannot be reduced. 12 - Sweet Thumb - Due to the magics he imbues his garden with, Maple is able to grow his candy in nearly any kind of environment or atmosphere with little to no drawback. There is also an automatic sugar barrier on the first set of candy tiles made per combat protecting them from damage once, but if it is taken then it is taken from all tiles even if they are separated. Candy List: 1.  Ew.  Toffee.  -1 to a number of your choice on your character sheet. 2.  A jolly rancher!  Not one of the good ones, though.  +2 to your next roll. 3.  A delightful peanut-butter cup!  Finally, the perfect fusion of peanut butter and cup!  Your Stamina costs are reduced by 2 for the next round. 4.  Ooh, a hershey’s *kiss*~ the next target you kiss on the lips has advantage on their next roll.  It’s double advantage instead if the kiss is sincere. 5.  A tough but delicious jawbreaker.  You get 2 DR against physical damage for the next round. 6.  A peppermint candy cane!  Damage increased by 2 for the next two instances of dealing damage. 7.  A spicy hot mint!  +2 movement for the next two rounds. 8.  … why is this one in the shape of a man?  You have a doppelganger with 3 Stamina that can act during your turn.  It’s under your command!  Candy servitude!  (Note that the doppelganger of you is pretty ugly if you are not male.) 9.  A very sweet Lollipop!  The Lollipop can be licked three times, by yourself or adjacent allies who you allow.  Each time it’s licked, the person who licked it gets a +1 bonus to their next roll and restores 1 Stamina.  It can be licked multiple times at once. 10.  A jolly rancher, and for once it’s a flavor you actually like!  +3 to all your rolls this turn. 11.  A whole-ass snickerdoodle, for some reason.  All debuffs are cleansed. 12.  A very sticky but flavorful taffy.  One roll of your choice during the rest of combat has advantage.   13.  Pure, delicious chocolate.  Restores Stamina equal to 1.5x the initial healing given by the consumed candy, rounded up."
ability,Maple,Candyland,2,,"Welcome to my delicious labyrinth~ Maple twirls his staff and conjures a forest of candy from a point in the arena he chooses, the only restriction being that it must use one of his Sugar Garden tiles as its origin point, which consumes the tile used.  In up to 8 connected spaces arranged however Maple wants, a jagged labyrinth of sharp candy canes and sticky walls of sugar is created.  This deals 3 damage to targets caught by the tiles and knocks them in a direction of Maple’s choice if they are small enough.  The candy labyrinth is incredibly difficult to destroy or move through.  However, if allies move through one of the tiles, they can choose to consume the tile if they wish and give a roll of their choice a +1 bonus.  This can stack up to three times, and no more than three tiles of the labyrinth can be eaten per turn.  "
ability,Maple,Sugar Rush!,2!,,"Imbues an ally within 6 spaces with a rush of sweet energy!  They heal 4 Stamina and gain 2 movement for this turn.  If used in direct response to a target taking damage, it has a +2 bonus to its roll.  Once per round."
ability,Maple,A Very Merry Unbirthday,3⛯,,"Glowing with starlight energy and performing a beautiful dance, Maple unleashes his magic to conjure a huge birthday cake in an area of his choice!  The cake is 4x4 spaces in size and can either push targets out of the spaces it appears in or trap them inside, Maple’s choice.  The cake can be eaten by allies or enemies as a free action, but only one tile at a time.  Each piece of cake heals Maple or his allies for 4 Stamina.  Enemies, however, take 2 damage and have a -2 penalty on all rolls during this turn for each piece eaten.  If someone is trapped inside the cake, it can be destroyed from the inside, but it is very difficult unless you eat your way out!  For the purposes of destroying it, the cake has a total Stamina value equal to the amount of healing that uneaten tiles could potentially provide.  Once per combat."
weapon,Nines,Soulfire Chains,,,"Chains made out of a strange soul fire from within Nines’s body flies out, seemingly propelled automatically to strike at an enemy. Deals 4 damage at 4 range. 27: Choose one: +1 basic weapon damage or range. (+1 damage)"
talent,Nines,Sworn Protection,,,"Once per session Nines can pick a single party member that she will swear to, promising them their protection. While you can activate this immediately upon the session’s start, it should be used due to an actual RP reason why she would do this with someone, although she is quite quick to protect her friends. For the rest of the session, Nines can roll to jump in the way of any attacks going towards them once per round."
passive,Nines,Soul Sacrifice,,,"Nines’s epithet allows her to burn away her very soul to further fuel its flames. Whenever Nines spends stamina on abilities, she can choose to spend her maximum stamina in addition to current stamina. Doing so causes either a single effect of the ability to be doubled, or alternatively one effect out of her “Nine Sacred Pledges” to be applied to the ability in some way. Once a pledge has been used in a session, it can’t be used again in the same session until all other pledges are used. She regains all the max stamina she spent this game and returns to her base at the end of the session. 16: Whenever Nines spends max stamina, all enemies adjacent to her take 1 damage. 24: So long as Nines has current max stamina that’s half or less than her usual max stamina, her conviction strengthens. She gains a non-stacking flat +2 to all rolls she makes."
ability,Nines,Mark of Martyrdom,2,,"Flaming blood leaks from Nines’ fingertip, and she quickly draws a cross in the air with it. This sigil immediately crystallizes into raw power before shattering, sending a burst of flame forwards. This creates a 3x7 area in front of her where the force bursts forwards, dealing 4 damage to every target inside and blowing them back to its maximum range. Every time this ability is used in a combat, the stamina cost of this ability increases by 1, but its damage and long-ways range increase by 1. 33: +1 damage on Mark of Martyrdom."
ability,Nines,Savior Chain,1!,,"Nines sends out a chain towards an ally, attempting to grab and pull them out of the way of an attack. However, if this roll fails Nines can choose to pay another Stamina point to have the chain release a pale fire at its tip, causing half the damage that would’ve been dealt to her ally to be dealt to her instead. Once per round."
ability,Nines,Rosemary Ninetails,3⛯,,"Nines begins to float in the air as her very soul ignites into flame. From this, she pulls out from her chest a rapier made of flame and chains. This weapon represents her very life force, letting her deal damage to a single foe equal to the amount of max stamina she is missing from her usual maximum. She can choose to keep the blade outside of her body and use it again on her next turn, but this requires her to pay a 3 Stamina upkeep cost, and if Nines paid max stamina for this ability then the upkeep will also have a max stam cost to it. If Nines were to theoretically lose this weapon before she puts it back away, then she’ll continue to take upkeep cost until she dies.  She can use her Nine Sacred Pledges on this ability, but not her passive’s ‘doubling’ effect.  Once per combat."
ability,Nines,Cage of Conviction,3⛯,,"Nines defines a 3x3 area in any location, so long as she’s still a part of it.  Any enemies within the cage takes damage whenever Nines herself takes damage, equal to the amount dealt -1. Enemies or Nines traveling through the cage’s border also deals 3 damage to them. In addition, Nines can disassemble and reassemble the firey cage to be teleported over her once again as a bonus action. Once per combat."
ability,Nines,Soul Share,1!,,"Nines reaches within herself and takes out a chunk of her burning passion to give to an ally. This boosts their roll by however amount Nines desires, however this is at the cost of her next roll suffering an equal negative in return. Once per round."
ability,Nines,Binding Pyre,1,,"As a bonus action Nines may name any condition that she must follow or sacrifice she’ll make, in return for power. The more punishing or strict this restriction, the greater boost in power she is given in turn. These restrictions only go away at the end of combat."
weapon,Pandora,The Scepter Of Chaos Carnage Heart Attack Whoopsie Uh Oh Big Owch Oh Boy Oops Uh Oh Fucko Boingo Mega Oof Mistake: ,,,Shoots a beam for 4 damage. 41 - Weapon Upgrade - If Pandora rolls naturally a 14+ she can chain the effect of her weapon on to another target within its range.
talent,Pandora,The Squeakquel: The Threequel,,,"Once per round, Pandora can use her basic weapon as an anytime action. 46 - The Squeakquel: The Threequel: Racing Stripes - Does anyone remember that movie about a zebra racehorse? Pandora’s basic weapon when used as an anytime action will either be rolled with advantage, will have counter rolls to it be rolled with disadvantage or give Pandora the titular Racing Stripe, giving her +1 movement and a +10 to coolness factor till the end of her next turn. This is rolled with a d3."
talent,Pandora,OH RIGHT! I HAVE THESE!,,,Pandora has wings! Yup! And if she’s flying she leaves a trail of maaaaaaagical pixie dust that tastes like sprinkles and fear! Also if she is airborne she can spend 1 stamina to drop a single present within 2 spaces of her as a once per round anytime. Also her movement is increased by 1 :D
talent,Pandora,A PARTY???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,"When Pandora rolls for initiative she can choose to be at the top or the bottom (The GM still can still put bosses etc over Pandora’s turn at the top of initiative if they want). If she chooses to be at the top she can take two main actions on her first and second turn of combat. If she chooses to be at the bottom all of her abilities will cost 0 stamina and she can roll for everything on her tables twice and get both effects until the end of her second turn. If she chooses to keep her rolled initiative any random effect she rolls until the start of her second turn is a lot stronger, potentially up to a once per combat effectiveness, but that effectiveness will go back down to normal when her second turn begins."
passive,Pandora,***ALL IN!!!***,,,"At any time, Pandora can take any roll she makes and make it a critical success or a crit fail.  If a roll is below 10, she can round it down to a critical failure, and she gains 5 Stamina for doing so.  If a roll is a 10 or higher, she can round it up to a natural 20 by spending 1 Stamina for each number she increases it by.  She also heals for 1 Stamina each time she intentionally suffers an ill effect of something she does. 27 - Passive Upgrade - ***ALLERR INNERR!!!!!*** - PANDORA DOES NOT NEED TO OBEY YOUR WHIMS!!! Pandora says this to the nearest inanimate object...this is not important. Anyway. Whenever Pandora rolls below a 5 she can bring it down to a natural -11 and suffers the consequences, they are very *very* bad, but she does heal for 10 stamina for doing so. When she rolls above a 15 she can bring the roll up to a natural 31 and gains great benefits for doing (including proficiency), but she does have to pay 1 Stamina for every number she increases her roll by.  Also she now heals for 2 whenever she suffers an ill effect she has caused on herself (except from a -11)."
passive,Pandora,Physicality?  More Like *FUCK!!!*,,,"Pandora’s physical form is…. Something!  It rarely if ever reacts in the way one would expect it to, and almost always in the most cosmically nonsensical and cartoonishly over-the-top way possible.  Examples include her spinning around like a paper top if she’s punched, splattering into a pile of goo if she falls from a high height, or something disappointing happening to her and she literally shatters to pieces like glass.  She doesn’t suffer any ill effects from any of these strange occurances, and is highly resistant to simple and straightforward attacks and effects of this nature."
passive,Pandora,Dragon Tamer,,,"Pandora has a pet dragon named HATRED!  She’s as cute as a button and has devoured entire civilizations!  *Who’s a good girl~?* 50 - Fuel My Hatred - Hahahahah~ Who’s a good girl Hatred. You are~ Yes yo.....Hatred eats Pandora whole. A few moments pass for what feels like eons before Pandora grows out of Hatred’s head triumphantly, this enhances all of her capabilities...somehow… She is fully healed and her current max stamina is increased by 1.5x and she is able to take 2 actions a turn (but not Hatred’s “kit”) and whenever she rolls she rolls with advantage, anything rolled on her tables is rolled twice with both results happening at once. This lasts for 2 rounds as she somehow starts to calm down afterwards and is just tired like a crazy baby. She is set to 1 stamina and Hatred is removed from the rest of the session, she can also only do this once per session if Hatred were to somehow return. Hatred is here for this upgrade you see and there’s not a god damned thing you can do about it, let the girl pet her monstrous dragon!"
passive,Pandora,Bucko Foingo,,,"DING DING DING DING DONG!!!! WE HAVE A WIIIIINNNERRR!!! Every 7th time Pandora rolls on one of her tables the swirls in her eyes roll away and become jackpot 7’s and her freckles all light up and change colours at incredible pace. This of course means it’s time for the lightning round jackpot, Pandora has 7 free rolls to use on any of her tables and can activate them all at the same time, choosing who the targets are if they need to be targeted. Only the effects happen but if they affect a large area (like firework, then that still applies) these rolls also do not count towards a new Bucko Foingo jackpot. For every one she uses on herself she heals for 2 stamina!!! YIPPEEEEE!!!"
ability,Pandora,Super Destruction Reality Unwinding Final Ultimate Color Craft Catapault *KABOOM!*,3!,,"Pandora conjures a comically gigantic firework out of thin air and instantly launches it.  The resulting explosion detonates in a 5x5 area, dealing 1 damage to everyone inside it, and dramatically shifting the bonds of reality therein!  She rolls a d35 to determine the effects. 25 - Wuh-oh! I oopsied! Hahahaha! If any of Pandora’s allies are inside the area of the explosion they no longer take damage and instead are healed for 1 stamina. Pandora still takes damage though! "
ability,Pandora,PRESENT TIME!!!,1,,"With a wave of her scepter, 3 neatly-wrapped presents appear at random locations around Pandora.  I wonder what could be inside!  Someone can open the present if they want and immediately suffer the consequences, but if no one opens it before the start of Pandora’s next turn, they explode, dealing 2 damage to everyone adjacent to them and affecting all of them with whatever’s inside anyway!  She can also spend 1 Stamina to make them all explode at any time!  1d50 is rolled to determine what’s inside. 43 - PRESENT MIMICS!! YAY! - When making her presents Pandora accidentally added an extra ingredient to the gift wrap, an entire goddamn mimic. And they’re kind angy tbh. By paying an extra 2 stamina when using PRESENT TIME!!! Pandora can make all of the presents she summoned into mimics. They have 8 movement and a 2 damage basic attack that inflicts Wild Magic 2, they move on Pandora’s turn but are ***not*** under her control. They can only be defeated by having Pandora detonate them or opening them up to gain the precious goodies from within. If she rolls a 15+ while using this ability, then one of them is under her control."
ability,Pandora,Magishift,1!,,"Pandora exists at the universe so hard that she causes it to shift its axis ever so slightly.  This changes the polarity of her scepter and gives it new effects when it’s used!  She rolls 1d10 to determine the new type of magic. 30 - This effect is toooo boring for me right now. When Pandora rolls on this weapon table she can roll on it twice and pick the one she wants, but, if she pays an extra stamina she can instead roll on any of her *other* tables and apply that effect to her weapon instead….somehow. (She can do this *after* she sees what her other results are, but she only gets one roll)."
ability,Pandora,Hurly-Burly Hullabaloo Time For Me To Rhyme My Words~*,3,,"The sound of loud screeching pierces everyone's ears dealing 1 damage to all enemies in combat, while everyone is distracted, Pandora gets hit by a car……...Of course this doesn’t kill her and the car crashes into a target of Pandora’s(?) choice dealing 3 damage in a 2x3 area. But that’s not all, when the car explodes out pops……"
ability,Pandora,WILD MAGIC! ***2!***,2,,"Wild Magic is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oopsie! When it *could* be ***WHOOPSIE!!!*** And that’s why the scientists at Pandora Primrose Incorporated helped me to create this! Wild Magic: The Sequel!! Pandora points at a target and a random person no one has ever seen before in a lab coat appears and stabs them with Wild Magic 2. Oops, they also take 1 damage, unless they’re an enemy, in which case it’s **4** damage!! YAY!!~"
weapon,Paprika,The Lantern of Dreams,,,"O radiant lantern, so beautiful and bright…!  Paprika waves her lantern a few times, and a melodic ringing is heard as the colors inside it swirl and churn so beautifully… She targets someone within 4 spaces who must be able to either see the colors or hear the ringing.  The lantern then brings that person’s dreams and desires to life, and the air around them is filled with images of their current surface-level thoughts, with maybe a few deep-seated desires hidden there as well.  The dreams are then drawn inside the lantern, giving Paprika a single Dream of the individual she targeted.  If she currently has a Dream of the individual she targets, then when she uses this again, she can force them to take a single movement or main action of her choice."
talent,Paprika,Shiny… Buzzy…!,,,"Paprika is ridiculously more likely to attack targets who are either smaller than herself or glowing in some way.  If she has a reason to focus on something else, she must roll a 1d3, and only on a 3 can she shift her focus properly.  If the target is also insectoid in nature, she must attack them on her turn and cannot be convinced otherwise, however she does have a +2 bonus to attack them.  If she attacks an ally because of this effect, she will not attack them again for two rounds."
talent,Paprika,Stealth Predator,,,"A thing about Paprika that isn’t entirely obvious is that she is a master of stealth when she isn’t constantly showing off her lantern. If she would choose to, she can do things that really stealthy people can do. Like making her footsteps nonexistent and being able to hide really well in shadows.  Also if Paprika would use an ability/attack on a target that is completely unaware of her presence anything that requires a certain DC in order to achieve is reduced by 2 (this includes cits). However once a target becomes aware of Paprika it requires a good bit of effort to trigger this effect again."
passive,Paprika,Chameleon Cloak,,,"Paprika wears a plain black cloak that can be painted with any color she finds - even the color of dreams and desires!  With some effects of her attacks and abilities, Paprika can acquire Dreams from specific individuals, formatted as ‘Dream Of [Character Name]’.  Her lantern can hold up to five total Dreams at once, and only three Dreams per individual.  As a bonus action on her turn, she can spend a Dream to use a single attack or ability of the character she acquired the Dream from, but its effectiveness is a bit less than half of what it normally is and any effects it creates cannot persist for more than one round at most.  The aesthetic and flavor of the ability also changes to become more colorful and sparkly, dealing magic/fairy type damage in place of whatever other type of damage it once did.  If what she uses has a cost, its cost is increased by 1.  She can also instead use a bonus action to spend three Dreams of the same individual to permanently acquire one of their Colors, formatted as ‘Color Of [Character Name]’.  Colors give her a variety of different effects listed on a separate table.  Note that she cannot acquire more than one Dream or Color from any individual per turn by any method. 20 - Shimmering Cloak - Paprika’s cloak is a very interesting cloak. When she made it, she never realized until now that her cloak has been enchanted from some kind of magical source. Wonder how that happened. Because of this, she is able to hide herself within the cloak as a bonus action, camouflaging herself with the surroundings. While camouflaged she gains the benefits of being invisible as well as a +2 to damage or a +5 to her next roll, however she loses these benefits once she moves. If Paprika doesn’t want to be sneaky she can open up her cloak, as a bonus action, a little bit more than usual while bright rainbow colors cascade out of it. While the bright colors of the cloak are within eyesight of a character (typically they would have to be in front of Paprika as well as facing her), said character has a minus 1 to rolls, and Paprika has advantage on harvesting Dreams from said target. As well as abilities that typically don’t grant dreams grant dreams on rolls of 18+ while targeting one who can see the shimmering colors coming from the cloak (she cannot gain dreams form using dreams). Color Table: One Color:  If Paprika has one Color of a certain individual, she can use a free action to paint herself to look exactly like that character does.  Whether she’s very good at impressions is another story, but it’s pretty convincing.  While taking on the appearance of another character, she can flavor the ability she uses in a manner befitting them and give minor new properties to what she’s using. Three Colors:  If Paprika has three Colors belonging to a single individual, then when she transforms herself into them, she starts to take on the aspects of that person more fully.  When she transforms, she has that character’s Passive, and two other attacks or abilities of her choice.  Note that the transformation wears off at the end of her turn if she does use one of their attacks or abilities. Five Colors:  If Paprika manages to get five Colors belonging to a single individual, she can freely use their entire kit when she transforms into them in addition to her own, and can stay transformed into them for up to two rounds at a time.  She can also use up to three properties of the individual (Passives, Attacks, Abilities) even while not transformed or she’s transformed into someone else."
passive,Paprika,Frailty,,,"Paprika is notoriously weak physically, despite how much she exercises.  Almost like something is draining her strength…?  Paprika has disadvantage on strength-based rolls (unless she’s using her tongue), and if she picks Stamina as a reward, she only gains half the listed amount (rounded up).  She also cannot pick Stamina as a reward more than once per session."
ability,Paprika,Blend It Out,2,,"Paprika uses her trusty paintbrush and paints herself or an adjacent ally to look like the surrounding environment, effectively turning them invisible for one round.  While invisible, a person cannot be targeted unless a loud noise or other effect would give away their position, or they are hit by an AOE attack.  If they take damage in this way, the invisibility does not wear off but they can be targeted with a -3 penalty.  When someone attacks or uses an ability while invisible, the invisibility ends immediately and the roll for it has advantage.  Also, because this is Paprika’s special blend of Void Paint  invisible targets gain 2 movement while this lasts. 32: Lizard Lizard Paint Evolution - Twice per session (once per combat) Paprika is able to treat her invisibility as intangibility allowing her to be nigh undetectable and move through most any obstacle until she strikes.  If she uses Blend It Out on someone else, they may also treat it as intangibility, but only once per session, and not during the same combat as she uses it."
ability,Paprika,"Warm, Inviting Windows",3!,,"This chameleon girl’s eyes might be weird and creepy, but… gosh, they’re just so pretty…!  The way they swirl like a whirlpool and glow like a firelit window on a cold winter’s night… wait, weren’t you supposed to be doing something?  If someone within 4 spaces of Paprika is able to see her eyes, they suddenly get distracted and start drooling a little bit.  This can weaken or interrupt attacks, and on rolls of 15+ while Paprika has one of the individual’s Dreams, Paprika can also create an illusion between herself and the target of their heart’s deepest desire, potentially distracting them even further.  They must focus on the illusion until they make a resist roll to figure out it’s not real.  The illusion lasts for two rounds at most.  Once per two rounds."
ability,Paprika,Sticky Hunger,1!,,"Almost of its own volition, Paprika’s tongue suddenly lashes out from her mouth up to 8 spaces away and grabs on to pretty much anything it can!  Depending on the size and weight of what she latches on to, she can pull herself towards the object or pull the object towards herself.  If she ends up adjacent to an enemy after using this, then, well… I mean, they kind of taste good… and even though Paprika mostly eats small insects, she’s isn’t really that picky!  She sinks her sharp teeth into the target for 5 damage, and on rolls of 15+ she can get a Dream from the individual via the taste of their blood alone!  Alternatively, instead of grappling directly to a target, if a target has had ‘Lantern Of Dreams’ used on them during this combat, she can latch her tongue onto one of the Dreams floating around them and pull it directly to her, acquiring it without moving or the need of an exceptionally good roll. 24 - Hungry Lizard - Sometimes Paprika’s tongue doesn’t even get to lash out as Paprika’s natural instinct is to just have her just bite something instead. Paprika can now use Sticky Hunger as a purely melee attack, this does a number of things, one of which being reducing the damage by 1 as well as reducing the cost by 1. It also produces an additional dream of the target on rolls of 19+. While using Sticky Hunger this way it can be used in a defensive nature however it’s not as effective compared to base Sticky Hunger. "
ability,Paprika,Where Oh Where Does Your True Self Shine?,0,,"Paprika, full of innocence and lizard, looks towards her shiny lantern of dreams and watches it for a moment. The colorful pigment of the rainbow disappears leaving a cold and empty void. However for as quickly as it came, it returns with its full brightness seemingly like nothing ever happened. However it seems as though something happened when it went out.  Unrolled Free Action. Paprika may pay 3 stamina while using this ability to start the creation of a nightmare of an individual within 3 spaces of her. A nightmare is an ability passive or talent based on the individual's fears, becoming stronger or weaker depending on how strong the individual’s fears are. Nightmares are specifically created in real time by the lamp so Paprika may not get the ability in question right away. Nightmares are able to mimic kit features that the individual has however they cannot be the same thing. However she can have as many nightmares in the lamp as she desires. The more nightmares that are within the lamp however, the longer it holds its absence of color. Nightmares once triggered or used disappear. Paprika is aware that she can combine nightmares in the same way that she can dreams, she just hasn't tried to do it yet, nor does she know what it does."
weapon,Queen Worthless,YOU’RE USELESS!,,,"Queen Worthless declares someone to be useless. They are now useless for 1 round, meaning they will take 3 damage at the time of getting hit and 1 damage on their turn. This crits automatically on her “Shitty Gremlins” even if she crit fails the roll. 23 - Weapon Upgrade - +1 base damage, and the extra damage dealt at the start of the target's turn is not considered a status effect or mental effect and ignores DR. 47 - YOU’RE WORTHLESSNESS HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN! - The base damage of her scathing remarks increases by 1. In addition if someone were to be knocked out by this attack or the worthless damage they are horrifically morphed into one of Queen Worthless’ minions till the end of combat and can be commanded by her, they can still use their full kit but Queen Worthless takes the costs (they also get a shockingly high 5 stamina). If this is used to knock out a non-plot important PC or character she can make them her minion for the rest of the session, if they perish Queen Worthless may summon them back in exchange for rolling her minions like she did before her 25 prof upgrade. This weapon’s damage is now irreducible."
weapon,Queen Worthless,Behold!  My ***WORTHLESS*** Blade!,,,"Queen Worthless draws out a Bastard Sword with cloth bandages at the hilt constantly bleeding the red blood of all the worthless lives used to “forge” it. Deals 1 damage at 1 range and automatically has a x3 crit multiplier on Pathetic Little Minions and can be used as a bonus action on them specifically, she can target up to 3 adjacent Pathetic Little Minions at once. Strangely the Pathetic Little Minions don’t explode and are instead sucked into the blade itself, for every worthless minion Queen Worthless slays in combat with this sword, the damage goes up by 1 and for every 5 damage it reaches it’s range goes up by 1 for the rest of combat. She cannot use this to kill minions who used to not be minions, but she can use it on them to add properties of their powers to the blade."
talent,Queen Worthless,Really Big Trucks,,,"At the end of combats, after they have been fully healed, a d100 is rolled with Queen Worthless calling high or low. If she calls it wrong she gets hit by a bigtruck which deals half of her maximum stamina in damage (this cannot be stopped nor negated, it is just toobig, huuge) if she calls it right however one of her shitty Gremlins takes the hit instead. The truck then continues to drive away. 60 - Good News! - Queen Worthless now only has a 49% chance of getting hit by a truck at the end of combat. Go you! If the truck misses her she can have the minion it hits dive in front of literally anything to have it be hit by the truck at the same time."
talent,Queen Worthless,Pathetic Creature,,,Queen Worthless can just stare at someone reaaaaaally hard as a bonus action on her turn. They break out in a cold sweat (even if they can’t physically do so). They have a -1 to targeting Pathetic Little Minions for the next round. 55 - Target’s that Queen Worthless stare at with this now receive a -3 to targeting Pathetic Little Minions and a -1 to everything else (does not stack). In addition this bypasses immunities and resistances. If Queen Worthless pays an extra 3 stamina on this she can make her gaze act like an aura and affect any enemy within 15ft of her. But also it allows her to detonate minions inside her aura as an anytime action. This has a 2 stamina upkeep.
passive,Queen Worthless,Pathetic Minion Jamboree,,,"At the start of combat a “Shitty Gremlin Spawner” is placed in the middle of the combat area (or as close to the middle as possible). It cannot be moved or interfered with by anyone except Queen Worthless. On her turn a “Shitty Gremlin” is spawned. They have 10 movement, 1 stamina and deal 1 damage. She may as a bonus action on her turn roll a d4-1 to try and call in multiple Gremlins instead of taking the one automatic free one. There is no limit to how many Gremlins she can have and their actions can be combined to attempt to be better...maybe. 18 - Whenever a Pathetic Little Minion crits she gives them a picture of herself because they somehow did a good job. Once per combat she can gain a proficiency if they crit. 25 - MORE Pathetic Little Minions - Wow these minions are just flooding in, look at how many there are. Queen Worthless now rolls a 2d3-1 to summon her Pathetic Minions and her 1 guaranteed is upped to 2 guaranteed (if she chooses to actually do that). 35 - Maybe You Aren’t As Pathetic As I Thought...No, You Still Are - Whenever a Pathetic Little Minion would die to an explosion caused by another Pathetic Little Minion it can choose to hold on to it’s worthless life and survive the hit, while it is doing this, if it looks at Queen Worthless during this time she looks upon it as though god herself got gum stuck to the bottom of their shoes and it wasn’t even 5, causing it also explode for 3 damage to all those around it, except Queen Worthless. This can happen consecutively and as many times a round as necessary. In addition at the start of combat Queen Worthless rolls 1d2+1, she has that many minions to start combat with. 51 - Let’s Get Down To Business - Pathetic Little Minions have been going to karate class or something. They now deal 2 damage, have 2 stamina and explode for an extra 1 damage. In addition, Queen Worthless can now summon minions to her location 1 at a time while out of combat specifically. No Worthless Peasantry Shall Escape My Worthless Gaze! - Queen Worthless can now choose the location of her portal at the beginning of combat but also gets to see all those worthless little things that might be hidden from view. This allows her to see the entire map of a combat arena and also allows her to see things that are invisible or out of sight from the party. In addition she can see anything hidden on the GM layer that is within 10ft of her portal. She can choose not to activate these effects and it is recommended she don’t should she be on a map with dynamic lighting. Regardless, these effects are only active during combat."
ability,Queen Worthless,Go Be Worthless Somewhere Else,1,,"Queen Worthless moves one of her adjacent Gremlins somewhere else up to 6 spaces away through force (this can be through any method but usually by picking them up and throwing them or just kicking them). They explode on contact with the targeted area and die dealing 3 damage to everything adjacent to it. Shitty Gremlins can also use this ability but they must still pay the stamina cost for it and only one can do it per round. 29 - **'HAHAHAHA! QUEEN WORTHLESS SOCCEERRRRRRRR'** - Queen Worthless can now punt her minions even harder than before, she can now kick them up to 10 spaces away and curve them around obstacles with her patented “Minion Anti-Revolution Kick”. In addition, when they make contact with the target they bounce into them dealing 2 damage, bouncing back 1 space and then detonating for 3 damage to every enemy within 2 spaces of it. Pathetic Little Minions no longer pay stamina cost for this ability. This can also be performed as a bonus action on her own turn."
ability,Queen Worthless,Hmph! Incompetent Gremlins!,2!,,"Queen Worthless doesn’t like incompetence but she doesn’t mind seeing failure so long as it isn’t her or going to affect her. If Queen Worthless fails a roll or if an ally fails to assist her in some way she can “assist” them by having one of her Shitty Gremlins “take the fall” allowing her or that ally to reroll the dice but also causing the Gremlin to explode and die dealing 2 damage to everyone around it (except Queen Worthless). She can use this ability multiple times on her own turn but it cannot be used to assist a Gremlin and she must pay the stamina cost each time. Otherwise it is once per round. This can also be used to counteract a Nat 1 roll but only on her turn, it costs an extra stamina and it uses up all of it’s uses for that round, additionally the Gremlin just fizzles to nothingness not even exploding. Worthless. 38 - This ability may now be used as many times a round as Queen Worthless has minions for it and can be used on any roll including enemy rolls. In addition once per round out of her own turn she may use this to counteract a Nat 1 OR Nat 20."
ability,Queen Worthless,Regal Presence,2,,"Despite her ...moniker.... Queen Worthless is still an actual real queen and as such her mere presence is enough to feel inferior to her, unless they are also of the same level or higher than her, if ordered to bow before her they must do so. While bowing they may still perform actions as normal but they may not move from that position. If they do try to move they immediately take 3 damage and Queen Worthless gets 2 free Gremlins. The also have disadvantage while targeting Queen Worthless until the end of their next turn. 27 - Even Gods Are Inferior - Regal Presence may now be used on gods and other higher beings and with a +3. And Queen Worthless herself is now considered a god. Using this on regular beings does not have a +3, they aren’t worth it."
ability,Queen Worthless,Minion Protective Services,1!,,"Queen Worthless’s Pathetic Little Minions are usually not long for this world, but with this ability maybe they can last just a bit longer. Whenever a Pathetic Little Minion would die (except on a crit) Queen Worthless can attempt to save it’s pitiful existence with some “kind” “uplifting” or “motivating” words. This can be done 3 times a round but only once per Minion. If she only has one Pathetic Little Minion left this rolls with advantage."
ability,Queen Worthless,You Are Absolutely The ***WORST*** Minions I Have ***EVER SEEN***,3,,"You small worthless creatures! I absolutely must have more! Using this ability Queen Worthless can summon 2d4+2 minions from her portal. They not only have summoning protection keeping them from dying for the round they are summoned (this doesn’t stop Queen Worthless from ending them though). Queen Worthless can also, instead, use this ability to combine her worthless minions into one SUPER WORTHLESS MINION which can shift it’s form into almost whatever Queen Worthless wants so, with stamina, power and damage equivalent to how many were used in the creation. They can also just fire out 1d2 new minions from their mass as a once per round anytime action up to 6 spaces away, they can either explode or….not explode and just run distraction or something, they’re worthless so who cares. Anything damage dealt from minions exploding is proportionate to their size. Each use of this cannot be used multiple times in a row."
ability,Queen Worthless,Perish,5⛯,,Queen Worthless commands it and so it shall be. Every mook or low-tier summon (including Pathetic Little Minions) die exploding for 4 damage to every enemy and 2 damage to everyone else around them (except Queen Worthless). This also deals 9 damage to every enemy in combat ignoring DR or anything that would get in the way of them getting hit (can still be anytimed but only for solo defense). If anyone is knocked out through this attack they may not be revived for 1d2+1 rounds. Once per combat.
weapon,Rhapsody,Stinging Chords,,,"Rhapsody lets go of her violin and bow for a moment, which simply float in the air where she leaves them. She steps forward and forms her hands into claws before slashing forward.  A glowing music chord trails from each of her fingers that cut like burning blades.  They deal 2 damage in a 1x3 line directly in front of her and also increase in damage and apply additional effects based on her Symphony and how long she has been playing it. 31:  When Rhapsody uses Stinging Chords she can pay 1 stamina to leave the chords in place for the round, effectively creating a wall that damages enemies for the base damage if they pass through it or end their turn next to it. If allies pass through it however they act as though they are under the effect of “Spotlights On” for their next/current turn. 45 - Stinging Chords now deals an extra 2 damage and when it is used, Rhapsody may have the chord originate from up to 2 spaces away from her and may orient the line as she wishes. When using it while allies are within the line it does not deal damage but instead grants them the “Spotlights On!” buff until the end of their next turn."
talent,Rhapsody,Open the Curtains,,,"When combat begins, Rhapsody immediately moves to the starting location that is the most flashy or eye-catching the greatest number of people."
talent,Rhapsody,Spotlights On!,,,"At the start of each of Rhapsody’s turns, glaring blue spotlights from nowhere shine down onto Rhapsody and an ally of her choice.  That ally is considered to be inside the aura of her Symphony even if they are not within its radius or she is only extending the Symphony to herself.  If the ally moves into Rhapsody’s aura while a spotlight is already on them, they get a +2 bonus to any rolls they make that assist Rhapsody in some way. 39 - Understudy - An ally under the effect of her spotlight can act as a substitute for up to 2 of Rhapsody’s companionship upgrades with the partner half of the Upgrade being flavoured to the new understudy. If the one under her spotlight can be considered a performance artist then they can act as a substitute for up to 3 instead. At the end of combat, Rhapsody gains 1 Companionship with the one she had the Spotlight on the most."
talent,Rhapsody,Don’t Miss a Moment of this Performance,,,"Rhapsody has a +3 bonus when making combination attacks with others who could be considered performance artists of some kind, and also gains 1 additional Companionship with them each time she gains Companionship with them.  "
passive,Rhapsody,Symphony of the Soul,,,"While she has difficulty composing melodies from scratch, no one on earth is better than Rhapsody at bouncing off the performance of another.  At the start of each of her turns, Rhapsody can play a Symphony of her choice that creates a secondary passive for herself as well as applying new effects to her attacks and abilities.  This Symphony’s effects and aesthetic must run in direct contrast to an element, type of effect, or concept that she has seen during this combat or can infer based on her surroundings.  She uses this to create a sort of countermelody that makes it very difficult for her opponents to defeat her.  The effects she creates with the Symphony must involve creating or utilizing a specific substance or tangible effect; she can’t just negate what a target is doing or counteract something extremely vague like ‘damage’ or ‘knockback’.  The Symphony she creates will always be somewhat useful and powerful in countering the specific effects she desires, unless she has grossly misunderstood the nature of the effect she’s countering. She can choose to apply the symphony to only herself, or extend her music outwards to all allies within an aura.  The larger she makes her aura, however, the weaker the effects will be.  The maximum size of her aura is a 20 foot radius. At the start of each of her turns while she is playing a Symphony, she can choose to either to strengthen and modify the Symphony or switch to a new one.  The longer she is playing a single Symphony, the more powerful it will become at counteracting specific foes or effects, depending on what she adds to it.  If she switches to a new Symphony, she must start again from scratch; however, if she has been playing a Symphony for 2 full rounds before she decides to switch it, she can immediately use her hidden Crescendo ability that causes the Symphony to flare gloriously in power before it fades to the next. Oh, The Song Is Strange - Once per session for each of her weapons, passives and abilities Rhapsody is able to apply the effect of one of previous symphonies that she has played in the same session, this does stack with her current symphony."
ability,Rhapsody,Starlight Sonata,2,,"Rhapsody smirks and plays a chord of high-pitched notes, sending a blast of starlit energy at a 3x3 area of her choice within 6 spaces of herself.  This blast deals 4 damage to everyone inside it, and also deals additional damage and effects based on the Symphony Rhapsody is currently playing. 29:  A path between Rhapsody and the 3x3 area is made along the center line. If an enemy is standing on that line they take the damage of the ability and effects based on the symphony. If an ally is in the line they heal for 1 and receive a small buff based on the symphony being played until that symphony ends."
ability,Rhapsody,Harmonia Noir,2!,,"When someone uses an attack or ability that has a target of at least 2 spaces away, Rhapsody can use the bow of her violin to draw a line between the source and target, manifesting several musical bars of pure darkness between the two of them that resonate with whatever Symphony she’s currently playing.  If she is not playing a Symphony, the bars simply weaken the ability as it travels along them, but if she is, then the ability changes into something new entirely that conforms to her current Symphony, drastically altering its effects and how powerful it is.  The further the distance between target and source, the more powerful this ability is, as the attack will travel along the darkness for a longer period.  Any transformations she makes to physical objects such as weapons or body parts are very temporary."
ability,Rhapsody,Waltz Di Fantastica,1!,,"With a flirtatious wink, Rhapsody gracefully pirouettes into the air, moving herself up to 5 spaces in any direction.  This can dodge attacks, and her Symphony can also apply additional effects to this ability that can be either offensive or defensive in nature. 35 - When Rhapsody starts her pirouette she produces a musical note creating a burst of sound at the beginning and end of the pirouette that damages enemies within 2 spaces for 2 damage and applies a small effect based on her current symphony."
ability,Rhapsody,Audience Participation,3⛯,,"Once per combat, Rhapsody extends her arms and offers for her allies to join in her majestic performance.  Nine spectral music notes appear at random points throughout the combat arena that her allies can step on.  When the ally does so, they must use whatever they have on them to create *some* kind of music, whatever that may be.  When they do so, they are healed for 1 Stamina and their next roll has a +1 bonus, and the GM can increase these amounts if they find their performance particularly interesting… or amusing.  The notes will also apply small additional effects based on the Symphony Rhapsody is playing.  In addition, these nine musical notes are each numbered in sequence from 1-3, meaning there are three of each numbered note.  If Rhapsody’s allies pick up the musical notes in sequence, starting with a 1, then a 2, a 3 note, then starting from 1 again, then the allies who pick up the 2 note will heal for 2 and have a +2 bonus, and the ones who pick up a 3 note will heal for 3 and have a +3 bonus.  If all the notes are picked up in perfect sequence, all allies on the battlefield heal for 5 Stamina and have advantage on their next roll.  The notes disappear after 2 rounds."
ability,Rhapsody,Crescendo Galaxia,X!,,"Rhapsody can only use this ability when she switches from one Symphony to another after playing the first for at least 2 rounds.  The power of her music flares greatly and explodes outwards in a brilliant display, allowing Rhapsody to perform almost any effect she wishes as long as it makes sense within the bounds of the original Symphony and is suitably flashy and stylish enough.  The cost of this ability is generally between 2 and 5, depending on how powerful the Crescendo is. "
ability,Rhapsody,Moonlight Duet,3⛯,,"With a twirl on the spot and a beautiful illusory chord on her violin Rhapsody’s form starts to shimmer with shades of blue and silver before what appears to be a second Rhapsody is reflected like the moonlight on a lake of sound. This second Rhapsody, known as Moonlight, is summoned within 3 spaces of Rhapsody, has access to all of Rhapsody’s kit (though they share Once Per Combats and Anytime usages), any damage dealt to Moonlight is halved (rounding down) and sent to Rhapsody instead but Rhapsody must take the costs for Moonlight. Moonlight’s Symphony must either be the exact same or the exact opposite to Rhapsody’s current symphony. If the symphony is the same and the auras overlap the effects of it are doubled, if the symphony is the opposite and the auras overlap the area of overlap creates a null space where nothing that Rhapsody and Moonlight’s symphonies are playing against can activate or pass through. When Moonlight is created, Rhapsody may swap their current target for “Spotlights On!” to Moonlight. Once Per Combat."
weapon,Scarborough,Regicide,,,"A katana that gleams orange with searing heat.  She can use it to deal 5 damage at 1 range.  It is always imbued with an ever-raging fire, meaning it will deal additional damage to targets vulnerable to such, and on rolls of 15+ the target will be left with a burning effect that deals 1 damage at the start of each of their turns until they can put out the fire.  Attacks with Regicide have a +2 bonus if she is not using it as part of an ability, and it deals +2 damage if used against a tyrant or oppressor of some kind.  Scarborough cannot use this attack if she is frenzied. 37 - Regicide gains +1 damage naturally and if she pays 2 stamina when using it, it removes the roll requirement for the burn effect and grants an extra +1 damage."
weapon,Scarborough,Draining Claws,,,"The cloak Scarborough wears has hidden machinery in its folds that can instantly equip her with battle gear especially meant for her kind.  Wires travel up both her arms and surround her mouth, equipping her with enormous metallic claws capable of suctioning the blood of enemies they pierce, which then flows straight into the fierce-looking metal veil around her jaws.  When she attacks with these claws, she either makes two attacks against one target or one against two separate targets.  These targets take 3 damage per hit, and she heals for the same amount of damage dealt.  Her Frenzy increases by the same amount as well, unless she is fully frenzied, in which case it decreases by the same amount.  Attacks with these claws each have a -3 penalty unless the target is restrained or slowed in some way.  If Scarborough is frenzied when she uses these claws, each attack rolls with advantage and she can attack three times; she can also spend 3 Stamina to attack twice more."
talent,Scarborough,Is Vampire,,,"Scarborough is a vampire and has access to a variety of vampiric abilities as well as weaknesses. As a main action, she can drink a willing creature’s blood with her teeth or claws to drain their Stamina at a 1:1 ratio.  She can grow bat wings and fly.  She can walk on walls or crawl across ceilings. She’s a bit scared of running water. She takes 10 damage at the start of each turn in direct sunlight. She can’t cross a threshold of an owned property without being invited."
talent,Scarborough,Is Dead,,,"Scarborough is dead, therefore she cannot die… very easily, at least.  If Scarborough’s Stamina falls below the normal threshold that would kill her, it takes one more direct and intentional blow to her heart in order to fully destroy her, unless she is in bright sunlight."
talent,Scarborough,Wave Of Bloodthirst,,,"Twice per combat as an unrolled anytime action Scarborough may spend Frenzy to imbue those around her with energy. For every 2 Frenzy she spends, she and all of her allies within 3 spaces of her will gain a +1 to rolls and movement. In addition, for every 4 Frenzy she spends adds a +1 to all basic attack damage. A maximum of 12 Frenzy may be spent in this way and the buff only lasts for 1 round. Unfortunately Scarborough’s connection to her allies in this way boils her blood further, the round after she performs this she immediately gains double the amount of Frenzy she spent. She may not spend Frenzy in this way multiple rounds in a row and Frenzy gained through this method will be gained before the combat ends.  She cannot use this talent while frenzied."
passive,Demon Hunter,Can’t Deal With Wide Boards,,,"As we all know, those of the ‘Demon Hunter’ classification have one major weakness:  they cannot deal with hordes of enemies at once.  Since this is one of their greatest strengths, everyone who calls themselves ‘Demon Hunter’ can either use this passive or eventually learn it if they don’t have it from the start.  Twice per combat, when some kind of attack that hits multiple enemies is used, the Demon Hunter may choose to affect up to two enemies with the attack while they are adjacent to the affected area - essentially increasing its range or radius by one for those enemies specifically.  In the case of line attacks, this only works in the same direction the line is travelling in."
passive,Scarborough,The Blood of Queen Belphasma,,,"Through sheer force of will, Scarborough managed to consume the blood of the Vampire Queen, a feat thought impossible for hundreds of years; for whoever drank her all-powerful blood would surely become the Queen themselves.  Scarborough has maintained her individuality for the most part, but when a  battle gets too intense, the scent of blood begins to corrode her sense of self and send her into a hate-filled frenzy. Scarborough’s red stat is Frenzy, which runs from 0 to 77.  Each time she makes an attack on an enemy, her Frenzy increases by 5, and if she deals damage to them successfully, it is also increased by the amount of damage dealt (if multiple enemies are hit at once, her Frenzy increases by half of the total damage dealt to all targets, round down).  If there is a sizable source of blood nearby, then depending on how fresh it is and the amount present, she will gain 3-7 Frenzy at the start of every turn as well.  When she reaches the full amount of Frenzy, Scarborough enters a maddened state of bloodlust, drastically changing her powerset.  If combat ends when she is not fully frenzied, Scarborough’s total Frenzy is reduced by 15 or by half, whichever is lower. While she is not frenzied, Scarborough can spend 1-3 Stamina to apply either an Ice, Fire, or Lightning effect of her choice to whatever attack or ability she’s using, which can increase its damage or slightly alter its properties depending on how much she spends.  While frenzied, however, she can apply whatever element she likes by default, though the damage will not increase in this case, and the exact effects will be listed. Additional damage dealt with elemental effects does not increase Scarborough’s Frenzy. Scarborough’s Frenzy can also be decreased in various ways, either before or after she frenzies fully.  If someone uses a dual-tech or combination attack with her, her Frenzy will not increase as usual and instead be reduced by 5.  If allies deal damage to Scarborough, she loses half the amount of Frenzy as damage dealt.  Those who give her encouraging words or remind her that she’s with friends can also reduce her Frenzy by small amounts depending on what they say.  Finally, if Scarborough is fully frenzied, then any blood she drinks will reduce her Frenzy rather than increase it - therefore, allies can allow Scarborough to drink them, losing Stamina at a 1:1 ratio that her Frenzy decreases by.  She does not heal from blood drunk while frenzied. Scarborough’s frenzied state does not end until she reaches 0 Frenzy again or is knocked unconscious.  While frenzied, she loses 7 Frenzy at the start of each turn.  The first two main actions that Scarborough takes after exiting frenzy in a combat have disadvantage on their rolls.  If a combat ends while Scarborough is still frenzied, then combat does not actually end until her allies manage to either calm her down or knock her unconscious.  When the combat fully ends in this way, rather than fully healing, Scarborough is restored to 75% of her maximum Stamina.  If allies give Scarborough blood as part of calming her down, they do not heal the donated Stamina after combat.  They still heal all other damage taken as normal. 39 - Scarborough gains +2 movement and while she is frenzied she may move-act-move. 50 - Scarborough gains upgrades to some of her Frenzy actions, and when entering Frenzy, she immediately gains a movement and main action.  All of her frenzied actions also gain stacking advantage for each failed roll, until she succeeds a roll. 54 - Elemental Empowerment - Each of Scarborough’s elemental powers are increased in strength giving them a specific effect that will always happen on top of whatever else she is doing. Fire - The power of flame will now always inflict a burn that deals 1d4 damage at the start of the unit’s turns and increases their vulnerability to other debuffs and status effects for 1 round. Ice - Ice is cold and unforgiving, ice will now always reduce the movement of the afflicted unit by 2 (minimum 1) and pierces mundane DR. Lightning - Lighting is wild and unpredictable, the damage of the action and extra effects will chain to another 1d2 units, split as evenly as possible between them with Scarborough choosing where any extra damage goes."
ability,Scarborough,Slaying Slash,2,,"A cut like a reaper’s scythe, killing men, monarchs, and monsters alike; the world’s great equalizer.  Scarborough readies her blade, taking a defensive stance as her eyes glitter with focus.  By default, this attack deals 3 damage to all enemy targets adjacent to Scarborough as she swings her sword in a perfect arc around herself.  However, she can instead bide her time and allow the attack to charge for multiple rounds after she uses it, in which case this ability is a free action, though she cannot use Regicide on the same turn she uses this ability.  At the start of each turn, if she pays 1 Stamina, this attack’s radius increases by 10 feet and its damage increases by 2.  She can then either use it immediately as a free action or wait and continue charging.  She can do this for a maximum of five rounds before it must be used. 47 - Cutting The Tranquil Night - While Scarborough is holding her slash she may pay 1 Stamina to activate it as an anytime action instead of a free action on her turn. She can choose to roll for this if she wishes, and if she does she may do so with advantage. Doing this in the middle of a round does not increase the damage but does increase the range by 5ft. In addition, due to the speed at which she slashes any attempts to counter, dodge, parry or interfere with this slash are made with disadvantage. The base damage is also increased by 2."
ability,Scarborough,Sea of Red Carnage,5,,"Rather than sheathing her blade, Scarborough plunges it into her own chest, before drawing it an instant later, her own blood following the arc of a slash like a blade in of itself.  Everyone in a 30 foot radius around her instantly takes 7 damage from the boiling hot blood, and then must make a dodge roll.  If they roll lower than this ability rolled, they take 3 additional fire damage as the blood suddenly ignites and explodes into orange flames.  Every target hit by the initial damage is marked with a ‘Blood-soaked’ token, meaning that Scarborough’s next basic attack against them has a +3 bonus. These tokens cannot stack.  This ability cannot be used two turns in a row."
ability,Scarborough,With Midnight's Wings,2!,,"Swift as a shadow, Scarborough dissolves into a large swarm of vampire bats.  This can not only dodge attacks, but she can remain a swarm of bats for as long as she wishes, imposing disadvantage upon all attacks against her.  The bats have doubled movement, as well.  However, while she is a swarm of bats, she cannot take any actions except to swarm around a specific area and deal 3 damage to everyone within it.  The swarm takes up a 2x2 area.  Anyone who starts their turn in the swarm takes 1 damage.  Scarborough heals 1 Stamina for every target damaged by the bats.  She can only remain in bat form for one round at most, before she then transforms back.  It’s a free action on her turn to transform back, and if she does not do so on her turn then she has to pay 2 more Stamina to keep it active. 34 - When Scarborough uses this ability she can move up to 3 spaces in any direction; in addition, once per round when Scarborough moves while in her Bat Swarm form she may leave a singular bat behind her. The bat dies in a single hit but Scarborough can choose to take half of the damage the bat would have taken to keep it alive. In the case of AoE if Scarborough wants to keep any of the bats alive she must pick one to keep alive. She can spend 1 stamina as a bonus action to swap places with any of her bats left behind in this way. The bats even stay behind after she has transformed back to herself again."
ability,Scarborough,Devouring Blackness,6⛯,,"Roiling shadows and living darkness spread outwards from Scarborough’s form, and benign taking new forms unto themselves.  Within 4 spaces of Scarborough, six entities of living darkness are created, each of them wielding a sword that is either shrouded in flames, crackling with electricity, or made of glittering ice.  Each entity has 10 Stamina, 5 movement, and deals 5 damage on a successful melee attack.  When they deal damage successfully, Scarborough heals for 1 Stamina.  They are immune to damage from light or laser-type attacks and cannot be blinded, for they have no eyes.  The entities vanish after two rounds or when Scarborough is knocked unconscious or stops frenzying.  Once per combat."
ability,Scarborough,Cycle of Hatred,2,,"Scarborough slashes her sword or claws with terrifying speed, dealing 5 damage to all enemies in either a 10 foot radius around her or a 20 foot line in a direction of her choice, charging forward to the end of the line if she does so.  If she attacks with her blade, she can spend 2 additional Stamina to charge towards one of the damaged targets and leap on top of them, making a single attack against them with her Draining Claws.  If she attacks with her claws, she gains all of the damage dealt as Frenzy rather than half and heals for 25% of the total damage dealt (rounded down, minimum of 1)."
ability,Scarborough,Inescapable Fury,5!,,"Snarling, Scarborough suddenly leaps 35 feet straight up into the air, and begins whirling her claws around herself in a tornado of death.  She then launches herself at a 4x4 area of her choice, dealing 9 damage to ALL targets in the area and knocking them back several spaces.  Then, Scarborough chooses one of three elemental effects to occur: Fire:  The targeted area is consumed in flames, dealing 3 damage to everyone except Scarborough who starts their turn within them, and every target hit by the initial attack has a burn effect that deals 2 damage at the start of each of their turns. Ice:  The area around Scarborough is engulfed by glaciers that bloom from the ground, creating impassable terrain for anyone who can’t fly or is not strong enough to force their way through them. Lightning: Every target in the combat arena must make a roll.  On a 9 or less, the target is hit by a bolt of lightning that deals 2 damage and halves their movement on their next turn. Once per two rounds."
ability,Scarborough,Dance of Darkness,3⛯,,"Scarborough analyzes the battlefield and formulates a careful plan in her head for how best to approach the situation.  Four targets of her choice are marked with black ‘Dance’ tokens.  If Scarborough or one of her allies deals damage to an enemy with a Dance token, and an ally is within five spaces of that enemy, they can either immediately use a bonus action that would negatively affect that enemy in some way, or just use a basic attack on them.  The token is then consumed, whether the action succeeds or not. However, if an ally takes damage from an enemy while that ally is marked with a Dance token, Scarborough can immediately attack that enemy if she is within 4 spaces of them.  Only Scarborough can do this, however. If there are still tokens remaining at the start of Scarborough’s next turn, she can pay 1 Stamina and increase her Frenzy by 5 to place another token on one target of her choice.  This ability can be used as a bonus action if Scarborough is adjacent to an enemy and uses her main action to basic attack them.  Once per combat."
ability,Scarborough,Faster Than Light,5!⛯,,"Once per combat, Scarborough suddenly becomes a blur of pure darkness.  The next three successful attacks or abilities used against her will fail, and she can immediately move up to 5 spaces when this happens.  If someone rolls a 3 or less against her while in this state, she can immediately basic attack them from anywhere in the arena.  If someone rolls a natural 20 against her, it is treated as a normal success rather than a critical success (though it still grants Proficiency) and this ability is immediately dispelled."
ability,Scarborough,Decaying Sunset ,2!,,"Scarborough swings Regicide in a 360° arc around her, this deals no damage to anything except all light sources in the combat area, darkening everything to a purple twilight. In the ensuing chaos Scarborough has disappeared, turned to mist and travelled behind a target of her choice. If they are an ally she may assist them on their current action, though she must roll again to do so. If they are unfortunate enough to be an enemy they are pierced by her claws, taking 5 damage and either healing Scarborough for the damage dealt or giving her a roll bonus for her next 2 rolls equal to the damage dealt. Once per round."
ability,Scarborough,Crimson Moonlight,7⛯,,"While frenzied, Scarborough doesn’t even make a single movement as all light around for 6 miles is completely extinguished aside from a crimson moon hanging low in the sky above (even if they are indoors). In this moment Scarborough has completely vanished and every entity (aside from Scarborough herself or her shadows) in combat feels their body be ripped asunder. They all take 10 damage and have a bleed status that not only affects those without the capability to bleed but it is also exceedingly hard to remove. Scarborough gains a resource that can be used to buff her rolls as she sees fit equal to half the amount of damage dealt with this ability. Even after this attack is completed, the darkness and moon remain until her frenzy is dealt with. Once per combat."
weapon,Second Comet,Cyber Meteor Edge,,,"A black sword made of the same anomalous material Second Comet herself is made of. She wields it solely in her left hand. Cyber Meteor Edge deals 5 damage at 1, but when she makes an attack using it she does so with such a swift flurry of blows making it hard to parry or fully dodge. 21 - Flurry Of Blows - When Second Comet makes an attack with Cyber Meteor Edge they may split up their attack into three 2 damage attacks. She must roll for all of these but they each have a crit range of 18+ and it pierces mundane DR."
weapon,Second Comet,Comet Gatling,,,"Comet Buster transforms into a 3 barrelled gatling minigun that she can fire at up to 3 enemy targets within 3 spaces of each other up to 7 spaces away. This deals 2 damage to each of them but if Second pays 1 stamina at the end of a turn she uses this she can keep the minigun’s barrel spinning and fire it again for +1 damage as a bonus action on the next turn. After the third turn in a row of using it like this, the barrel overheats and it rests back to base. This weapon can be used mid-movement."
weapon,Second Comet,Comet Buster,,,"A giant black cannon grafted to Second’s right arm, it has the same look as her original cube state and the only thing that she didn’t put on herself. It has a lot of different functions that have yet to be fully explored. Currently it fires a heavy shot of energy that deals 10 damage at 10 range in a 3x3x10 area, this knocks all entities in that area 3 spaces out of it and knocks any flying or entities not on the ground to the ground and prone. The area left behind crackles and sparks in greenish-blue electricity which for the next 2 rounds acts as an Ignition Zone as though made through Ignition Zero. The force of Comet Buster when used knocks Second Comet back 3 spaces. Recharge 5-6 on a d6."
talent,Second Comet,Witch's Intuition,,,"Using her non-magic computer brain, Second Comet scans the battlefield and is able to learn one of three things about her surroundings. This can be either the Max Stamina total of a unit in the combat, the proficiency of a unit in the combat or one “dangerous” action one of her enemies can take that is lower than Outclass Level. She also learns of the current state of the terrain and area she is currently in. (10) Gathering Intel - Hacking Initiated - Second Comet has been learning from Joanne and gains advantage on all hacking and actions that have her directly interface with machines. This does not occur within the database or other purely digital spaces. 24 - Magic Wavelength Detection - Second Comet is capable of determining the nature of the powers those around her are using, this works especially well on technological powers and magical powers. When she is fighting an entity that utilises either of those two power types she gains a +2 to using her anytimes against them. In addition she rolls advantage to detect magic in the area or any hidden technology."
talent,Second Comet,A Being Not Of This World,,,"Due to her strange circumstances and… biology… Second Comet is not as affected by things that normal humans would usually be affected by. In addition whenever she personally knocks someone out, her eyes light up in flame for a moment and she gains a +1 to all of her rolls for the rest of the session to a max of +10. If she reaches 10 she can spend it to increase her crit range by 2 for the rest of the session and her eyes are permanently alight."
passive,Second Comet,Blades From Beyond Space and Time,,,"Surrounding Second Comet at all times are a myriad of metallic black feathers, these feathers don’t seem to be much on their own but when combined with her epithet they make for a deadly combination.  Second Comet has a maximum of 9 feathers and she regenerates all of them at the start of each of her turns.  As a part of an action she is taking she may pay 1-3 stamina to have an equal number of feathers shatter and implode into spatial distortions within 6 spaces of her that lead to another point in space and summon shining black swords (one per portal), known as her Raven Blades.  She may immediately make rolls for each sword to have them fly towards an enemy within 6 spaces, dealing 2 true damage (pierces DR and defensive effects, can only be dodged/interrupted), and they may fly into existing portals if they have range remaining and fly out of new ones for further attacks, though the blades only deal 1 true damage each in this case.  She must roll for these further attacks as well, and a single blade cannot emerge from the same portal more than once.  When she fails the roll for one of these attacks, that sword dissolves into black feathers.  In addition, if any of her Raven Blades are dodged or interrupted, she cannot use them any further for the current action. Up to 2 of the portals left behind when her blades are summoned are capable of staying on the battlefield until the end of combat, and link to each other or any other current portal she has manifested, but otherwise portals stay around until the end of the current turn. Units can not travel through the portals but projectiles can, in addition enemies can’t move through a space being occupied by a portal if they are the same size category as it or smaller.  When any projectile passes through Second Comet’s portals, their range is refreshed. During her turn, Second Comet can spend 3 feathers to take an additional movement or main action, but she must alternate between these options, and cannot use Comet Gatling if it is currently cooling down.  Instead of using main actions she acquires in this way, once per turn, she can instead store them in one of her feathers for later use; they cannot be used as anytimes, but they are stored until the end of combat.  To use a stored action, she must spend the feather she stored it in, and that feather cannot be spent on anything else in the meantime.  She cannot gain additional movement or main actions on a turn when she uses stored actions.  Stored actions are rolled with a +3 bonus, she can summon up to 1 Raven Blade with them without paying Stamina, and she can move-act-move when using them. (17) Rocket Powered Cyber Assassin - Second Comet is constantly floating a few inches off the ground at all times and her movement is increased by 2. 28 - Fires From Beyond The Stars - When Second Comet calls Raven Blades forth she can wreathe them in pink and blue fire that shrouds the blade as though a nebula in space shooting through the stars. This inflicts a burn status that cannot be resisted freely and must take either a movement or main action to do so if a status cleansing effect is not used, and deals damage at the start of the afflicted unit’s turns equal to the stacks of the burn but it can only be applied to a single unit once per blade. In addition, while they have the burn on them, Second Comet knows their location and they may not use anything that would cause them to be “invisible” or some kind of equivalent as the flame makes them visible to all in direct line of sight anyway. BIG & small - When things pass through Second’s portals Second can pay 1 stamina and roll to try and make them larger or smaller when they exit. The better the roll the better the size change but bigger changes may need her to pay more stamina."
ability,Second Comet,Warp Chain,3,,"Second Comet attaches one of her feathers to a target that is the same size as her or smaller within 6 spaces of herself or a portal, from there she can either pull herself to that target and may smack them over the head with Comet Buster dealing 5 damage, give them a mild concussion and knock them prone, or she can pull her target to either herself or an ally that is within 6 spaces of them or a portal which deals an immediate 3+X damage if they are dragged through the portal (where X is the size of their largest dimension -1) but also allows the ally she drags them towards to perform a basic attack that cannot combo, or another simple disruptive action (such as grappling or tripping) of their choice.  If Ignition Zero is currently active, the size limitation on this ability is removed."
ability,Second Comet,Light Space Movement,2!,,"As though moving at an imperceptible speed, Second Comet can blink-dash up to her movement in any direction, including upwards. If she spends 2 feathers in conjunction with this ability she can also make an immediate basic attack (at half effectiveness rounding up) on any target she is in range of during or immediately after this dash. Once Per Round. (12) Null Space - When using this ability a portal is manifested in her original space that, if used to dodge an attack or other action, absorbs the effects of it reducing its effectiveness by half and storing the properties of that action as information within one of her currently unused feathers. These properties remain on that feather and entities that pass through portals created by it up to 3 times before the information is depleted. The portal follows the rules of “Blades From Beyond Space And Time”."
ability,Second Comet,Ignition Zero,3⛯,,"Second Comet’s body starts to whirr, lightning crackling off of her back and arcing onto the ground around her, Second Comet focuses intently on the current battle scenario. Upon entering this state she may immediately refresh a Once Per Combat or Recharge Action, she gains full flight capabilities, her basic attacks have their damage increased by 1.5x rounding up and she gains full move-act-move. The lightning coming off her body discharges into the ground, allowing her to choose up to 25 connected spaces that extend infinitely upwards, with the first one being the space she activates this ability in, this area is her “Ignition Zone” which doubles her movement, and the range at which her feathers can be placed along with the range of the blades themselves is increased by 4. Second Comet and her allies, while in an Ignition Zone space, also gain a 1 cost once per round anytime dodge that has anytime priority. Upkeep 2+1 per round active. Bonus Action. Once Per Combat."
ability,Second Comet,It Came From Space,1!,,"Second Comet creates 2 portals within 8 spaces of herself; these portals, however, can be entered by herself and her allies but otherwise follow the same rules as with “Blades From Beyond Space And Time”. Once per round."
ability,Second Comet,Locating Familiar,2,,"Second Comet’s a Witch right? And all witches need a familiar or two. By combining two feathers together, Second Comet can create a familiar in the form of a metallic raven. This familiar has 3 stamina, a flight speed of 6 and a basic attack that consists of 2d2 Raven Blades that deal 1 True Damage each at 6 range. These Ravens also count as portals. While she has a Raven out she cannot use those feathers."
weapon,Ketsu,Midnight Iron,,,"A kanabo, as plain and simple as any could be. It’s heavy as a motherfucker not that such a paltry weight could stop you. 1 range 8 damage. (13) Basic Attack Upgrade: Dark Swing: When striking with a Kanabo you create waves of force by just swinging the massive weight, up to two targets adjacent to your main target take one third of the damage from the shockwaves. (Rounding Up on a good roll, down on an average/low roll)"
weapon,Ketsu,Lóng Zhī Sǐ - Enchanted Weapon (Mythical Status),,,"A simple enough looking blade with a temper pattern and guard patterned after a multitude of flames of varying colors. This item is soul-bound to Takano Ketsueki and cannot be removed from her unless she entirely willingly gives it up. This weapon takes the form of the weapon that its current user would be most comfortable/capable of fighting with, and is thusly currently in the form of a Kanabo. If they so should wish it can be turned back into its base blade as a free action on the user's turn. Stats: Kanabo State: 1 range 8 damage. Sword State: 1 range 8 damage. Other States Dependent On Wielder: generally 5-8 damage, can become gauntlets, a bow, a gun, whatever. Effects: While being held you may passively choose to erase/dispel any dimensional barriers/subspaces you are in. Rolling a natural 20 with this weapon grants proficiency, regardless if it normally would. "
passive,Ketsu,I Can’t Beat The Shit Out of You Without Getting Closer,,,"Your movement cannot be lowered by terrain effects, stopped by any interrupts, and if a target would try to use knockback on you it is always half as effective if you wish it to be. "
passive,Ketsu,Oni Might,,,"Because of traits of your more monstrous ancestors you can become even larger if you so wish, being able to switch to a large tile as a free bonus action once per session, your horns grow longer and your teeth more pronounced and your normally off-pink skin becomes a dark scarlet. You have +3 to all physical damage, resistance to fire damage, and when you would be knocked unconscious the first time you are instead set to one, and the first cost you would pay per round is lowered by 2, to a minimum of 0. In general you also have immunity to human poisons and disease."
passive,Ketsu,Aiming For the Top,,,When rolling initiative at the start of combat you can choose to give up squares of movement from your first move action to increase your numeric initiative result. Spending your entire movement on boosting this gives you a 1.5x multiplier on the amount you can raise it by. If you would be at the top of turn order if not for something like “Boss Initiative” it only takes one square of movement to raise yourself above whatever nonsensical value they have above you. If you obtain this upgrade in the middle of combat you can choose to do this immediately using your next move action.
ability,Ketsu,Closer Towards the Middle Point,1,,"You can target something within 3 spaces and cause it to warp and shift with something which is considered its opposite/counterpart and make it closer to that alternate concept, potentially either slightly weakening or empowering it depending. The more changes you currently have active the weaker they all are. If the shifted thing leaves your effective range it returns to its previous state."
ability,Ketsu,Warp Bullets,1,,"Taking pockets of air and then condensing and changing both it and the space they occupy you can make projectiles which are incredibly volatile and hone directly towards the intended target. Choose a target within 10 spaces and then roll 1d4 to determine the amount of bullets being fired. Each bullet does 2 damage. Deflecting these are fairly easy the further away from the target you are, with a free counter given to people 7 spaces or more away. 18: Covering Fire - When using Warp Bullets you may divvy up the bullets across multiple targets, and you now have a +2 to the amount of bullets generated."
ability,Ketsu,Trek Through SpaceTime,3!,,"Take 3 squares of movement through either space and/or time. If through space you just move as normal, if through time you disappear for the amount of steps you took turns in initiative, appearing at whatever spacial location the end of the total movement would’ve taken you. Since you aren’t present for them you cannot be targeted nor can you target things for turns you are moving through. If moving through time would cause you to end up standing in the same physical space as someone else you can either force them into an adjacent tile as you displace them or choose to for a brief moment forcibly overlap with them before reality forces you to separate, dealing 1d6! Irreducible damage to both you and the target. Once per round."
ability,Ketsu,Arrival of the Meteoric Wave,4⛯,,"Taking your kanabo in a solid grip, denting into the metal with your immense strength, you may take up to 3 squares of movement towards a single target of your choice, after which you will strike down and create a massive amount of damage via the shrapnel created from hitting the earth being launched forward, regardless of whether or not you are in range of your target. This attack does your kanobo’s damage to *all* targets in a 12 space line, 1.5x that to your intended main target. If your intended target is directly adjacent to you when you swing down they instead take double the damage and the line is shortened to 6 spaces long. The tile you hit directly with your Kanabo is treated as being double difficult terrain (3 spaces to move in or out of). Once per combat."
ability,Ketsu,I Always Meet My Mark,1+X!,,"Missing an attack is a byproduct of not reaching in its intended way, or, in more simple terms, not making proper contact. So you’ll just have to make sure you’re always going to make proper contact. As part of an action targeting an individual you may “mark” them with this ability, while marked you always make contact with them, even if you only do so minorly. So long as they are marked you always are treated as having at least a partial success on targeting them. X is equal to the amount of actions you want it to last for, to a maximum of 3. If used on a target you are currently in melee range of, you only need to roll to see if you can extend the amount of actions the mark is good for, it will always give you one guaranteed hit. Once per round."
ability,Ketsu,Soaring/Diving Hawk,3+X,,"Much with the majesty and simplicity of the life-changing event she went through, Ketsu makes a vertical leap to a point in the air before soaring towards a target of her choice up to 4 spaces away horizontally. Upon reaching her target, Ketsu grabs them and keeps on moving, sliding to a point up to 4 squares away. After that she fucking annihilates them with any attack of her choice, including any ability, but she’d have to pay the relevant cost. You specify which attack you’ll use before rolling this, and this roll counts as the roll for both the movement/targeting and the following attack. If you roll a natural 20 and used an attacking Ability you gain two proficiency, since you effectively crit on two separate abilities."
weapon,Tekken,Dawn of Creation,,,"Tekken’s briefcase contains a miniature star bearing the unbridled power of infinite creation.  It generates a massive amount of heat, but nothing can truly scar the hands of a gamer (except Carpal Tunnel, that shit sucks).  She can attack with the briefcase itself for 4 damage up to 6 spaces away, and it deals 6 damage if used in melee range.  When she attacks with it at range, she hurls it through the air and it ricochets off the opponent, spinning back towards her before hitting the ground halfway between the two of them.  Hitting the opponent successfully gives her 1 Chain, and if she catches the briefcase, she generates 1 additional Chain.  As a free action on her turn, she can also summon one of her other weapons to use on this turn.  She can do this once for free, but if she spends 1 Chain she can switch the weapon to a different one."
weapon,Tekken,Hellfire Star,,,"Tekken’s signature flaming sword, pulled from the depths of a star.  Throughout the blade’s length are metal segmentations hooked together with burning chains.  It deals 6 damage at 1 range by default.  Attacking successfully will generate 2 Chain the first time per turn, then 1 Chain for each attack afterwards.  She can also grapple to certain objects with the blade and pull herself towards them.  "
weapon,Tekken,Scalding Farewell,,,"A silver, long-barreled handgun that shoots flaming bullets.  Sweet.  Deals 3 damage at 5 range.  This attack only costs 1 Chain to use, and generates 2 Chain if she damages a single enemy with it three times in a single turn, and if she does so, she can spend 1 Stamina to immediately leap to a space adjacent to that enemy."
talent,Tekken,"You’re Not Just Some Casual Gamer, Are You?",,,"At the end of every session or data bounty Tekken is in, she will pull one of the party members aside who either rolled the most 20s, or was just generally the most baddest and hardcore of the rest of the party to the point where they genuinely impress her, and reward them with 1 additional Proficiency.  "
talent,Tekken,"Born In The Flames, Molded By Them",,,"Tekken takes half damage from fire or fire-based attacks, not because she’s a demon… but because she’s a gamer.  Actually, no, not because of that either.  Science has told us that gamers are not actually less flammable than most people.  It’s actually because she’s been around fire her entire life; both of her parents were blacksmiths and she was literally born on top of a hot anvil in their forge."
passive,Tekken,Combo Chain,,,"Tekken is a master of intricate combination attacks that utterly destroy her opponents before they can react in turn.  Unlike most, Tekken does not have a main action or a movement action on her turn, instead she has a red stat called ‘Chain’, which starts at 0 and goes up to a maximum of 15.  When her turn begins, she gets 5 Chain. Attacking with a weapon costs 2 Chain. Each of her abilities have a Chain cost equal to its Stamina cost. Every two spaces that she moves costs 1 Chain. In addition to spending Chain on her turn, using her attacks successfully will generate Chain as well.  However, every time she deals damage on her turn, all damage she deals decreases by 1 until the end of her turn, and in addition it becomes easier to counter her as she spends more Chain on her turn.  She still deals a minimum of 1 damage with her attacks.  All attempts to counter Tekken’s abilities with anytimes or otherwise have a penalty equal to her current Chain minus 5 (before cost) up to maximum of a -5 penalty.  If she still has Chain when she ends her turn, it carries over to her next turn, however it is reset to 0 at the end of combat.  Buffs that increase her movement or allow her to take more actions will instead increase her Chain, with it increasing by 2 for each extra space of movement and increasing by 5 for each additional action."
passive,Tekken,Slayer Techniques,,,"Tekken has a set of unique and powerful abilities that are definitely not ripped off of fighting game characters she’s played.  These abilities are each once per session, and they all roll with advantage.  Tekken can not use other attacks or abilities on her turn after using one of these techniques.  Each of them cost Chain equal to twice its Stamina cost.  However, to help pay for this Chain, Tekken gets a secondary resource called ‘Slayer Points’ for every three successful attacks she lands during her turn.  Slayer Points can be spent in place of the Chain costs for these special abilities at a 1:1 ratio.Dying Breath Of A Phoenix (5) - Tekken’s eyes glow with searing heat as she whirls her briefcase and brutally uppercuts an adjacent opponent, sending them flying into the air.  Using the momentum of her swing, she leaps after them, and closes her eyes for a moment before opening the briefcase and unleashing its full power for a moment.  A pillar of infernic destruction blasts into the opponent and annihilates them, blasting them even further into the air than they were before.  This deals 12 fire damage that is not subject to being decreased by her passive, and for each point of damage dealt successfully, the target is knocked one space further into the air by the flames.  They begin falling at a rate of two spaces per turn on initiative, likely taking additional damage when they hit the ground if nothing is done, and they are unable to take actions while they are in the air unless they only took very minor damage.  If their turn arrives while they are still in the air, they will hit the ground immediately and be able to take their turn. Searing Supernova Slash (6) - Drawing her blade, Tekken heaves a terrific slash around herself that extends the blade beyond its usual maximum range, hitting everything around herself in a 25 foot radius, and continuing to spin, slashing over and over again until nothing is left but ash and broken dreams.  Enemies around herself take an initial 8 damage and are knocked back 3 spaces, and Tekken’s slash continues spinning until the start of her next turn.  At the start of each turn on initiative, everyone in the sword’s area takes another 4 damage and is knocked back another 3 spaces, and Tekken can then move one space.  This pattern continues until the attack ends at the start of her next turn.  Allies in the sword’s area are not knocked back, but they do take 2 damage per turn while they are in the area from the heat of Hellfire Star alone. Dance Of The Dragon Lord (4) - Flames shroud Tekken’s form as her eyes narrow to reptilian slits.  For the next two rounds, Tekken becomes a living engine of destruction, gaining immunity to fire damage, 2 DR against physical attacks, and during this time, her damage does not decrease over time due to her passive. Hell On Earth (5) - Flicking open her briefcase, Dawn Of Creation, Tekken unleashes its full unbridled power and fires the miniature sun out of it like a missile.  It blasts into a target within 6 spaces and deals 7 fire damage, knocking the target back a few spaces.  Afterwards, the area the sun occupies becomes impassable and it begins radiating an intense aura of heat in a 25 foot radius.  Enemies within that aura take 1 damage upon entering the aura or starting their turn there, and have halved movement while in the aura and a -2 to offensive actions.  Tekken can keep the sun out of the briefcase for as long as she wants, though she cannot switch weapons or create items unless she is adjacent to it.  Each turn that she keeps it out, she must spend 3 Stamina as upkeep, and she can move the sun up to 5 spaces away for free, and spend Chain to move it further if she wishes."
ability,Tekken,Purgatory Cleave,2,,"Tekken must have her sword equipped to use this ability.  Separating the blade into its full segmented form, it becomes an enormous flaming chain whip capable of damaging several enemies at once.  Lashing it around herself in a crimson slice, the whip deals 2 damage to everyone she chooses within 4 spaces of herself, generating 0.5 Chain per enemy hit (rounded down)."
ability,Tekken,Soul Dash,1!,,"Channeling the power of her damned gamer soul, Tekken dashes in a straight line up to 4 spaces away.  This does not cost Chain.  Once per round."
ability,Tekken,Hunter-Seeking Rounds,2,,"Tekken must have her gun equipped to use this ability.  Turning on aim assist might be for noobs, but if it gets the job done, then it’s no skin off Tekken’s back.  She rapidly fires several bullets in a 3x3 area in front of herself, and these bullets travel much more slowly than normal, but they’re equipped with miniature jets that allow her to carefully maneuver them.  On each subsequent turn on turn order, tekken can move each bullet one space in any direction.  Bullets can pass through allies and each other.  Each bullet that hits an enemy during her turn specifically generates 1 Chain, up to a maximum of 3.  During her turn, she can spend 1 Stamina to give herself six spaces of movement that she can divide between the bullets as she wishes.  The bullets deal 3 damage each on a hit, and the damage they deal does not decrease due to her passive. "
ability,Tekken,Creation... From Destruction,2,,"Reaching into the inferno inside of her briefcase, Tekken pulls out a small to medium-sized object that’s composed entirely of flame.  This object can be a weapon that she can use during this turn only, or pretty much anything else.  If she uses the created item successfully, it generates 3 Chain. "
ability,Tekken,To Destroy Those Who Serve Evil,3⛯,,"Once per combat, flames wreathe Tekken’s form as she enters a state of absolute focus.  This ability is an auto-success, and does not cost Chain.  Instead, Tekken can immediately take one action that does not cost Chain and is not subject to decreases in damage from her passive.  If this action is not successful, she generates 3 Chain.  If it is successful, she generates 5 Chain, her next two rolls this turn have advantage, and the next two actions she makes are not subject to decreases in damage from her passive."

weapon,Zenith,Explosive Punch,,,"Balling her fist, Zenith lunges at an enemy with an incredibly strong punch.  Which of course results in an incredibly strong explosion as well.  Her punches deal 7 damage at 1 range by default, and typically knocks enemies backwards several spaces when she uses it.  Not only can she use her passive on the target itself to give the punch an additional burst of power, but she can also use it on anything the target is knocked into as well, potentially dealing more damage and knocking them in a new direction. Heart of Fire, Breath of Life: If used on the same turn she charges Ki, the roll for Explosive Punch has advantage and deals 1.5x damage (rounded down).  If she rolls a 15+ when she uses this, her main action is not used up.  This can only occur twice per turn."
weapon,Zenith,Windmill Solar Burst,,,"Zenith glares at the enemies who have dared to stand before her.  Why don’t they sit on their FAT ASSES instead?!  She unleashes a devastating kick on a 2x3 area of her choice that’s within melee range, causing an explosion to arc outwards and blast all enemies hit for 3 damage.  They are also knocked out of the area and have halved movement on their next turns due to hitting the ground, HARD. Heart of Fire, Breath of Life: If used on the same turn she charges Ki, Windmill Solar burst hits a 6x8 area instead of a 2x3 and deals 4 damage at base.  If she pays 3 Stamina after using this attack, it is a bonus action instead of a main action."
talent,Zenith,Like That Ninja Kid From One Piece,,,"Zenith may not have seen Bleach, but all martial artists know how to increase their speed during a sprint, and with Zenith’s epithet, it’s even easier.  Her movement is increased by 2."
talent,Zenith,I Eat That Shit For BREAKFAST!,,,"Not only is Zenith immune to fire and explosion damage, but damage of this kind, as well as general sources of fire, can actually heal Zenith instead.  The more damaging or potent the damage, the more she will heal for, generally healing for around 50% of what it would have dealt to her."
talent,Zenith,"Fuck You And Your Spacemen, Cosmo!",,,"Zenith now deals 1.5 times damage to anything that’s summoned during a combat, and if she knocks someone into a summon or knocks away a summon, an explosion is triggered on that summon without her needing to roll or spend Stamina."
passive,Zenith,Fists Of Destruction!  And Also Arms And Legs And Head And Other Stuff Of Destruction!!!,,,"Every part of Zenith’s body is a boiling inferno ready to burst outwards with explosive force!  As a bonus action on her turn, she can spend 2 Stamina to make any part of herself or anything she’s touching suddenly explode violently, giving her attacks and extra destructive boost or potentially knocking away enemies.  She can even detonate the air itself.  She has to roll for this, but even a critical failure won’t completely mess up the attack, it just won’t add anything to it.  She’s able to destroy almost any kind of defensive barrier or physical DR a target possesses by doing this, but tougher barriers might require more Stamina or a high roll.  She can also break through walls and other objects with relatively little issue.  Also, Zenith is completely immune to fire or explosion damage of any kind. "
passive,Zenith,"Heart of Fire, Breath of Life",,,"Through continued, intensive training, Zenith has learned to harness Ki-like energies to further enhance her explosive combat style.  By spending her movement action on her turn, she can focus her Ki and begin charging up, giving her 1 stack of Charge.  For each stack of Charge she has, damage she deals specifically with explosions is increased by 1.  Her attacks and abilities also gain additional effects if she charges her Ki during the same turn she uses them.  The maximum Charge she can have is only 7, as her epithet makes her energies too unstable to gather the power of other fighters who use this technique.  Once per combat, she can fully infuse her Ki with her draconic flames and lend her energy to someone else in a torrent of fiery light, targeting an ally within 8 spaces and causing them to burst into flames, but these flames carry the warm energies of life rather than being destructive.  The target heals for an amount equal to the damage she has dealt with her passive explosions during this combat, plus her total Charge stacks.  All of her Charge stacks are spent when she uses this."
ability,Zenith,Blast Breath!!!,2,,"Zenith inhales.  Uh oh.  Her eyes burn with a ravenous inferno for a moment before she unleashes a terrific stream of flames from her mouth, ravaging a 4x4 area of her choice.  All targets inside the chosen area take 5 damage and are knocked to the nearest space outside the area, even further on high rolls.  In addition, the sheer force of the fire blasts Zenith backwards through the air, and she lands on a space up to 6 spaces backwards from where she used this ability initially.  She can choose to either fly backwards through the air if she jumped in the air, or across the ground if she was still on the ground.  Once per combat, this can be used as a free action. Heart of Fire, Breath of Life:  If used on the same turn she charges Ki, Windmill Solar burst hits a 6x8 area instead of a 2x3 and deals 4 damage at base.  If she pays 3 Stamina after using this attack, it is a bonus action instead of a main action."
ability,Zenith,I…. Totally Meant To Explode That!,2!,,"Sometimes Zenith tends to get a bit too excited and hyped up during a battle, so much so that she tends to activate her epithet… on purpose.  Completely.  All according to plan.  Yep.  Something that Zenith has touched during this combat suddenly explodes and detonates, whether it’s an enemy target, an object, or even the air she’s breathed.  This only deals 3 damage but can interrupt or disrupt enemy attacks or potentially other things.  If she has passed adjacent to any allies during this combat, she can also cause them to explode as well, however in this case the explosion doesn’t deal any damage and instead just knocks them to the side several spaces, potentially allowing them to dodge an attack. "
ability,Zenith,Dragon's Claw Rush,3,,"Snarling, Zenith charges up to her movement speed in any given direction and immediately makes three Explosive Punch attacks on a single adjacent enemy.  These punches are so rapid-fire that they don’t knock the target back immediately; instead, once the attacks are performed, they take off like a missile in the target direction, blasting through anything and everything in their path and taking additional damage depending on what they pass through or collide with.  The distance they travel depends on how many of the punches hit and how high she rolled, but even if all of them fail, this ability will deal roughly the damage and knockback of one punch, dealing far more the more of the punches succeed. 50:  A Dragon Never Gives In - If ‘Dragon’s Claw Rush’ fails its initial roll, or if the rolls of two of its three attacks fail to deal damage, then Zenith’s main action is not used up.  In addition, when she charges forward with it, a trail of flame is left in her wake that deals 2 damage to those who pass through it. Heart of Fire, Breath of Life:  If used on the same turn she charges Ki, she rolls with advantage and can ignore all obstacles and difficult terrain between her and her target, as she fully flies over them.  Rather than unleashing a flurry of punches, Zenith instead kicks off of them and boosts herself into the air above the target, repositioning herself up to 6 spaces away.  The target then rolls 1d8+4.  That is the number of punches, so rapid that they take the form of orange beams of light, make contact with them.  They take that much damage plus her usual basic attack damage for each punch, are knocked back that many spaces, and for half as many (rounded down) turns on initiative, anytime actions they take will cost triple the usual amount."
ability,Zenith,"In Three Seconds, YOU’RE FINISHED!",2!,,"This anytime can only be used immediately after Zenith or an ally Zenith has dual-teched with deals damage to a target.  Zenith snaps her fingers and rigs the target to explode in three turns.  Once three turns pass, the target takes 4 damage and is knocked in a direction of their choice.  In addition, any damage the target takes before the explosion detonates is increased by 1, and they are also knocked back one space or one additional space.  Once per two rounds. 58:  Three… Two…!  Eh, I Lost Count - Zenith can now trigger the explosion of ‘In Three Seconds, YOU’RE FINISHED!’ anytime she wants within the three turn limit, including immediately, though triggering it before the limit will cause it to only deal 2 damage. 65:  Finishing Flare - ‘In Three Seconds, YOU’RE FINISHED’ is now once per round."
ability,Zenith,Incarnation of Flame,5⛯,,"Once per combat, Zenith’s very soul alights with flame as anger flows through her veins.  Focusing her power into a single point, a tower of flame emerges from her body and assumes a massive, draconic form that is under her control.  The amount of Stamina the Incarnation possesses is equal to the half of the damage specifically from explosions that Zenith has dealt to targets over the course of this combat.  The Incarnation can use any of Zenith’s attacks and abilities on her turn (except Incarnation Of Flame), spending cost as normal.  It has 10 movement,  is 3x3 spaces in size, and can fly.  In addition, abilities it uses successfully will also spawn ‘Living Explosions’, which are 1x1 versions of itself that each have 3 Stamina and deal 2 damage and 1 knockback with melee attacks.  Living Explosions fade immediately when the Incarnation is destroyed.  Zenith or her allies can ride on the dragon if they choose, but anyone touching the dragon takes 2 fire damage at the start of each of her turns (except Zenith of course).  "
weapon,Aki,Neutral Game,,,"A simple autocombo, Aki does a few hefty punches, one of which puts her behind the target. 5 damage, melee range. It can be paused in the middle of for reduced damage (3), but ending up at the back of the opponent. This counts as 2 attacks if finished, and 1 if paused for reduced damage. If she finishes it, Aki cannot combo further. EX: Follow My Lead - Aki grabs the target as though leading a dance, forming shards of glass around them and throwing them from makeshift wall to wall, dealing 6 damage and leaving them with no red health. Aki can end up on either side when using this. CRIT: Heretic’s Resting Place - Aki does a somewhat quick flurry of blows, before knocking the opponent upwards and slamming her fist into the ground as glass spikes appear around the arena temporarily. They fall onto the spikes as they shatter, dealing 7 damage to the target and 2 damage to Aki...It takes a lot out of her. She can not combo out of this."
weapon,Aki,Throwaway,,,"The worst grab in the game is easily Aki’s. A terrible hitbox, deals 2 damage, sets the damage scaling up pretty fucking high, while it’s success is guarenteed to those adjacent to her it probably isn’t worth doing."
passive,Aki,EXcess Power,,,"Coming from a fighting game (it had an OVA at one point so it works), Aki has several unique mechanics about her. Every time Aki lands an attack, they get ⅕th of a meter. When they get 5, they get 1 Meter, and can use an EX move. They can have a max of 5 meter. All of Aki’s abilities and her basic attacks are free actions on her turn, and she can use up to 3...Providing she can use all of them successfully. If she fails a roll, the combo ends. In most cases, Aki can combo one move into another so long as it isn’t used twice in a row. Aki’s abilities all have CRIT variations, which happen whenever she gets a natural crit. Rolling crits also only deal 1.5 damage, instead of 2X. (Damage Scaling) As more and more attacks land, Aki deals less and less damage to make sure shit doesn’t go ABSOLUTELY fucking insane. The more hits Aki lands, the higher it goes, the lower the damage. This only applies to one combo string, before resetting next round. Crescent Moon Style - Considered the most broken of Aki’s phases, it reduces the amount of attacks needed to get 1 total meter to 4 "
ability,Aki,Shatter-Shell,2!,,"Aki charges 4 spaces forward, closing the gap and dealing 4 damage. She can also appear behind the target with the attack. This solely deals damage, not cancels actions. EX: Defenestration (+1) - Aki lines up a bunch of glass panes and slams the target through them, leaving shards of glass around that deal minor damage if walked on. Usually deals 5 damage. She can only dash 3 spaces if she uses this. CRIT: Boundary Breaker (+1) - Aki creates 3 glass copies to flank the target, each one charging into the target, the last one knocking the target into Aki. She responds by uppercutting them for massive damage. 6 damage, slight bleed effect, can be followed up. This ability is considered bullshit, because it pretty much makes your combo her combo now, go to the corner and cry about it."
ability,Aki,Light,0,,"A quick blow that hits the opponents stomach for 3 damage. It has +2 to hit. Not powerful, but certainly a good place to start a combo. EX: Medium (+1) - A harder attack, Aki kicks the target in the shins for 5 damage. If this succeeds and the next attack is an EX or a CRIT, they deal increased damage. CRIT: Heavy (+2) - Aki slams her hand into the target, dealing decent damage to her but more damage to the opponent. Deals 7 damage and rolls with a +2 if it’s finishing the combo."
ability,Aki,EX: Glass Breaker,5,,"An ability only able to be accessed in it’s EX form, Aki harnesses and shapes the glass of her epithet into a sword and brings it down on a target. It deals 7 damage and is less affected by damage scaling than normal. Its hitbox is also pretty fucking big, and an overhead for some ungodly reason. CRIT: Astral Blood - Aki’s Finishing move equivalent, she manifests a glass sword, strikes quick and chaotically at the target, each strike forming a crack until it creates something like a spiderweb pattern. She then forms her glass hand into a gun and pulls the trigger, causing the spiderweb to shatter with the bits of the character going with it. This deals 12 damage, and she gains an extra proficiency if someone is knocked out or killed with it."
weapon,Effie,Troublemaker,,,The Effie Brutalizer Special! It’s a metal bat covered in colourful paints and ribbons. Deals a fun rough and tumble 6 damage at 1 range and when it strikes something it leaves the target with a mark of “Fun” :D
talent,Effie,Beautiful in Red,,,"Aw man~ Everyone’s getting in on the Fun. Why doesn’t Effie do that too!! Effie can now gain stacks of “Fun”. Whenever someone would gain a stack of “Fun” Effie can put it on herself instead! For every stack of “Fun” that Effie has she gains +1 Movement, for every 2 stacks she gains +1 to damage and rolls and for every 3 stacks she gains +1 to crit range. Finally for every 5 stacks she has grants her an additional main action to use on her turn. Fun can only be activated on Effie twice per round."
passive,Effie,It’s All Fun And Games Until Someone Loses Their Head,,,"Seraphina Deuxlallie is the kind of girl you fall in love with on a lazy summer's day. You’ll laugh, you’ll play and then she’ll beat you to death with her bat. That is Effie Deuxlallie. Effie is all about fun and games, but for her that means brutally murdering people, whenever anyone attacks her or if an adjacent unit is given a status effect (even allies) they will also automatically gain a stack of “Fun”. To use Fun, all one has to do is pay 1 stamina on your turn while a target with Fun is in their primary weapon’s melee range and they get to make a basic attack, sorry rangies but just shooting someone’s no fun since you don’t get the bloodbath. Anyone may activate Fun but only one Fun may be activated per turn, unless it’s Effie who can activate one once per turn even if one has already been activated and even out of turn (it’s not even considered an Anytime!) :D. In addition Fun cannot be combo’d out of in any way out of your own turn and since uuuuusually people aren’t into the whole bloodbath thing :/ anyone who activates Fun that isn’t murder obsessed like Effie rolls with disadvantage. Fightsexual does not mean murder obsessed >:( so don’t interact!!!"
passive,Effie,You Can’t Catch Me If I LEAVE! :D,,,"Effie is just a murderer. There’s no other way to put it. And with a serial killer of her calibur around it’s kind of weird she hasn’t been caught or dealt with. Well, here’s the thing. For some reason whenever people try to catch her she discovers an “exit point” somewhere nearby that brings her somewhere else, this can even happen under her own feet. All this really means is that Effie cannot be captured or detained via any permanent means. "
ability,Effie,Serial Killer Serialisation,X,,"With a stomp on the ground and a twirl of her bloodsoaked hair Effie pulls out a torture device or murder implement of her choice and can then perform an action with it that can also incorporate “Troublemaker” in some way if she wishes. The cost of this is primarily determined by the gm but is *usually* between 1-3, but can be more. These usually only last for 1-2 rounds."
ability,Effie,Tasty Tasty Blood,1!,,"Listen! I just look good in red!! Effie can use this to move up to her movement +2 to any unit that is within range. If that unit also happens to be being attacked or taking damage in some way she gives them and the attacker a stack of “Fun” as she gets covered in blood...and maybe some of it gets in her mouth and maybe she drinks it, healing for 3 stamina and gaining a +1 to rolls for the round. Once per round."
ability,Effie,Bash! Bash! Bash!,3,,"Sometimes simple is the most effective...and the most fun~ Effie just goes to town on someone. Making 3 basic attacks against a single target. The first roll is for the first attack and if she rolls a 16+ in the set she may make another attack, this can happen indefinitely until the unit dies. If she makes 5 successful basic attacks in this way she heals for 6 stamina. Once per two rounds."
weapon,Ysabelle,Eye of Judgement,,,"This weapon, Ysabelle’s signature scythe, can only be used after it has been equipped using the Monkey Wrench of the same name.  It deals 6 damage up to 2 spaces away, and if Ysabelle spends 3 Stamina and uses her main action, she can special-summon a Reaper-type Pal of her choice from the Graveyard at half of its usual strength."
passive,Ysabelle,The Last Card Game You’ll Ever Play,,,"Ysabell might only be 17, but she’s a real motherfucker when it comes to Monkey Wrench.  She has a deck of 40 cards (+ her extra deck), and at the start of combat she draws 5 cards and one more at the start of each of her turns.  The hand limit is 6 cards and she can have up to 5 “Pals” and “Monkey Wrenches” out at a time.  Instead of being called the ‘Time-Out-Zone’, it’s referred to as the ‘Graveyard’ for her archetype specifically.  As a main action on her turn, she can roll to summon a Pal from her hand, or roll to play a Monkey Wrench either face-up or face-down as a bonus action.  She can roll to activate face-down Monkey Wrenches as an anytime. Ysabell’s card Archetype is Reapers."
passive,Ysabelle,And She’s Also An Actual Grim Reaper,,,"She is one.  She’s so stupidly good at this game, that her mom (another Reaper) got her an official and arguably pretty important position in the Underworld even though she’s still only 17.  Every time a dying soul demands to play a game in order to win back their life, she’s the one they play against, and you’d better believe she picks Monkey Wrench every time.  If anyone ever says they want to play a “serious” game with Ysabell or one that has “high stakes”, then the stakes of the game automatically become the challenger’s mortal soul.  If they lose, their soul is sent to the Graveyard but the real one, forever.  "
ability,Ysabelle,Duelist's Dance ,2!,,"Ysabelle can only use this in response to being attacked by an enemy.  She effortlessly blocks the attack with her scythe/duel disk, and then leaps up to 5 spaces away to a new location.  Until the end of her next turn, she can no longer block attacks but attacks made against her have a -2 penalty, and if the attack fails to do damage she can relocate herself up to 5 spaces away once again."
ability,Ysabelle,Death Approaches,1,,"Ysabelle marks a target within 5 spaces of herself or one of her Pals.  Each time that target is damaged by herself or her cards for the next two rounds, they take additional damage equal to 10% of their missing Stamina (rounded down, minimum of 0).  This ability is a bonus action."
ability,Ysabelle,Monster Reborn,3⛯,,"Ysabelle spins her scythe in a hypnotic pattern for a moment as a glowing green pentagram appears beneath her feet.  She selects one target that has died, been knocked unconscious, or otherwise defeated during this session and summons it as a being under her control.  Particularly powerful summons will be weakened significantly.  Once per combat."
weapon,Jack O' Lantern,Harvest Moon,,,"It’s Halloween and the autumn wind is blowing.  This enormous scythe made of death itself deals 13 damage at 2 range. In Lantern form, dealing damage will cause a line of ice spikes to blast out of the ground in the cardinal directions from the original target, dealing 4 damage in a 7 space line in each direction.  The original target and anyone hit by these spikes have halved movement on their next turn. In Jack form, everyone except Jack O’ Lantern in a 15 foot radius from the original target is engulfed in a fiery explosion that knocks targets 3 spaces back and deals 6 fire damage to them. Using Harvest Moon is a bonus action if Jack O’ Lantern spends 3 Stamina."
talent,Jack O' Lantern,Made of Candy,,,"Jack O’ Lantern is immune to any effect that relies on someone having a normal human biology, like bones or blood or any of that nonsense."
talent,Jack O' Lantern,I Spy a Copycat,,,"If someone tries to copy one of Jack O’ Lantern’s abilities, they must roll with disadvantage.  If they roll a 12 or lower, they turn into a small black cat until the END of their next turn."
talent,Jack O' Lantern,My Lucky Number,,,"Each time someone rolls a 6, Jack O’ Lantern gets a poker chip.  When she gets three poker chips, she can cash them in for an auto-success on her next roll.  She also gets a poker chip each time she fails an action."
passive,Jack O' Lantern,"Some Say The World Will End in Fire, Some Say in Ice",,,"Jack O’ Lantern’s two faces, Jack and Lantern, form the two halves of her personality.  Her powers are radically different depending on which half is active - Lantern’s abilities represent the cold embrace of death, while Jack’s are the infernal rage of hell.  Once per combat per player, when someone deals damage to Jack O’ Lantern or uses an ability where it would make sense, they can choose to say that they aimed at her head, reducing the damage, but switching it to her other half.  When she switches, this causes all of her currently active abilities to “Detonate”, doing damage and other harmful effects to those in close proximity to them.  But be careful - every time she starts her turn and she has not switched since her previous turn, all of her abilities grow more and more powerful until they’re impossible to deal with. Head Games~:  Also, twice per combat, Jack O’ Lantern can just switch heads at her leisure!  Boo-hoo for you~!"
passive,Jack O' Lantern,HAIL THE PUMPKIN KING!,,,"Each time Jack O’ Lantern takes an increment of 66 damage, all of her rolls are increased by 1, all damage she deals increases by 1, and she can immediately use one of her KING abilities.  KING abilities can be used regardless of the form she’s in, but they have additional effects that are influenced by the form she’s in. After this activates the first time, if she takes another 66 damage before one round passes, the next activation is skipped.  It can only be skipped twice per combat."
passive,Jack O' Lantern,Death With the Devil,,,"Jack O’ Lantern made a very bad deal once, a long time ago.  But she’s still a gambling woman, and now she’s the one making deals.  Once per scene, a player can offer Jack O’ Lantern a gamble to achieve a favorable result for themselves.  This could be turning a failed roll into a success, healing someone, doing damage, pretty much anything.  Depending on the result they want, Jack O’ Lantern comes up with an unfavorable result, and then flips a coin.  If the coin lands on Lantern, the player wins.  If it lands on Jack, Jack O’ Lantern wins. The Reason It’s Called “Trick” Or Treat - The hidden text of Jack O’ Lantern’s ‘Deal With The Devil’ passive.  In actuality, she does not have to make the coin flip a 50% chance, or even a 1% chance.  Jack O’ Lantern is an expert cheater and sussing her out is fairly difficult.  If a player definitively proves she’s cheating, their max Stamina is increased by 2, and all other players’ is increased by 1.  From then on, she has to be honest about the odds of the deal you’re making."
passive,Jack O' Lantern,The Witching Hour's Chill,,,"While in Lantern form, Jack O’ Lantern is surrounded by a 10 foot radius aura of extreme cold.  If a player starts their turn in the aura or enters it, they take 3 damage and their movement speed is halved for this turn."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Summon Them Boys (Yes. THOSE ONES.),1,,"With a mere wave of her hand, Lantern blurs the boundaries between life and death.  Four Boys appear wherever she wants in the arena, each of them with 5 Stamina, 3 movement, and a 3 damage melee attack.  If a Boy is killed by an attack that deals 7 or less damage, it can roll 1d2.  On a 2, the Boy splits into two identical copies of itself.  For each round Lantern has spent in Lantern form, the Boys’ damage and movement is increased by 1.  If this ability Detonates, any Boys left alive split into two identical copies of themselves."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Below Zero,2,,"Freezing mist condenses before crystallizing into two huge, jagged glaciers that each take up a 3x3 area.  Any players in the area where she summons the glacier take 5 damage and are pushed out of the area to the nearest safe square.  At the start of each of Jack O’ Lantern’s turns, the glaciers increase in size by one square either vertically and horizontally, and are still considered impassable terrain.  The glaciers have 10 Stamina each.  If she creates a glacier within her Ice Aura, it has 15 Stamina instead. If this ability Detonates, anyone within 15 feet of the glaciers is hit by a violent firey explosion and knocked back 3 spaces from them, taking 8 damage."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Spectral Grasp,1!,,"A player hears whispers of malevolent spirits, before suddenly, icy cold hands that are glowing bright blue appear next to them and snap closed, completely immobilizing them.  This ability cancels a players movement, or any actions they were performing.  At the start of each initiative, an immobilized player takes 1 damage, and Jack O’ Lantern heals for the same amount.  They can roll to break free of the hands as a free action on their turn, or an ally can spend an action to free them automatically, without rolling.  If Jack O’ Lantern uses this ability on a player inside her Ice Aura, it succeeds automatically.  Once per round. If this ability Detonates, the grabbed player is suddenly sucked into the netherworld and becomes a ghost until the end of their next turn.  While in ghost form, their rolls to inflict damage have a -5 penalty.  Non-damaging actions are unaffected."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Horrifying Gaze,2,,"Jack O’ Lantern tilts her head at an adjacent player, and for a brief instant, they perceive the original face of terror itself.  They must roll to resist this ability.  If they fail, they must truthfully describe their worst fear that they see within Jack O’ Lantern’s soulless eyes.  An effect occurs based on that fear.  They cannot take any harmful action against her on their next turn unless another player uses an action to comfort them.  The fear effect grows stronger every round that Lantern does not switch forms."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Freezing Wisps,1,,"As a bonus action, Jack O’ Lantern conjures two wisps of pure cold wherever she wants in the arena, as long as they are at least 3 spaces away from all targets.  On each of Jack O’ Lantern’s turns, the wisps can move 2 spaces.  If someone starts their turns in a space occupied by a wisp, they take 2 damage and all rolls they make this turn have a -2 penalty.  Wisps have 6 Stamina."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Blizzard From Below,3,,"Suddenly, the wind seems to gust upwards from the underworld itself, so strongly that all targets in the arena of Jack O’ Lantern’s choice are lifted fully off the ground.  For the next round or until this is interrupted, everyone has a -2 penalty to their rolls, can only move 1 space unless they can fly, in which case they have half movement, and take 2 cold damage at the start of each of their turns.  This cannot be used two turns in a row."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,BURNING SKULLS!,1,,"A hellfire of burning skulls rains down on a target that Jack can see.  The target takes 7 damage and is knocked backwards.  In the space they were occupying, a burst of flame engulfs that area until Jack switches forms unless it is extinguished somehow, dealing 3 damage to anyone who touches it or starts their turn in it.  In addition, two flaming skulls remain and now act on Jack O’ Lantern’s turn.  They roll as one, not individually.  They have 4 Stamina, 4 movement, and deal 3 damage on a hit.  At the start of each of Jack O’ Lantern’s turns, the skulls laugh manically, knocking back anyone adjacent to them 2 spaces.  They also grow one square larger and deal 2 additional damage.  The fire that was left behind also grows one square larger. If this ability Detonates, the skulls and flames explode into an icy hailstorm.  Any targets within 3 spaces of them take 4 damage, or 8 damage if the skull is larger than a 3x3."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,"COME TO ME, SLIPPERS!",2⛯,,"Once per combat, as an auto-success, Jack O’ Lantern summons the steed once owned by War himself, until she beat him at that canasta tournament.  Slippers has 25 Stamina, infinite movement, and can fly, meaning Jack O’ Lantern is much harder to reach while riding him (she can fly anyway but shhh).  Once per round, when Slippers is attacked, he can counterattack by breathing fire at the target, dealing damage and potentially negating their action.  If two rounds pass while in Jack form, Slippers’ Stamina doubles and he can now breathe fire more than once per round. If this ability Detonates, Slippers freezes solid, falling hilariously to the ground.  Anyone in a 2x2 square beneath him takes 7 damage, and Slippers essentially becomes a glacier as described in the ‘Below Zero’ ability, pushing them out of the square ect."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,HELL GEYSERS (HEYSERS),2,,"The ground beneath everyone Jack chooses begins glowing a concerning orange.  One round from now, the orange areas blossom into enormous 3x3 pillars of searing flame, dealing 10 damage to anyone in the area.  The fire then comes alive.  It still deals 10 damage to anyone it touches, but it only has 2 spaces of movement.  For each round that passes where Jack does not switch forms, the flames grow one square larger. If this ability Detonates, everyone and everything within 5 feet of the flames is flash-frozen.  They cannot move, and any action they take must be focused on trying to break out of the ice.  Others can help break the ice as well."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,BOO!,1!,,"When a target Jack can see takes an action, Jack O’ Lantern suddenly teleports in front of them and screams at the top of her fiendish lungs.  The player must roll the ability at disadvantage, and if they roll below a 10, they take 3 damage and the action is completely negated.  They are also knocked 4 spaces away from her.  Once per round."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,COLLECTION CALL,3⛯,,"This ability cannot fail or critically succeed.  Jack O’ Lantern conjures the power of the River Styx itself, and powers herself up to ridiculous levels, enough to kill almost anyone with a single attack, and during this turn, she has six attacks.  However, she’s the sporting type; each player can pay X Stamina to bribe her into weakening herself.  They can also offer to place debuffs or restrictions on themselves to help pay for the cost.  The cost of negating this ability entirely is 100, but even a fraction of that is enough to weaken the ability to manageable levels.  Once negotiations are concluded, she teleports to each of the players in turn and swings her scythe.  The power of the swing depends on how much of the cost has been met.  Once per combat.        "
ability,Jack O' Lantern,RAVENOUS INFERNO,3,,"Where tricks and cunning won’t strike true, a simple FIRESTORM will do!  Everyone in the combat arena except Jack O’ Lantern takes 8 damage and is set ablaze.  They can roll to put it out on each of their turns.  At the start of each turn, ablaze targets take 2 fire damage."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,NIGHTMARE SLASH,2,,"Jack O’ Lantern swings her scythe in an adjacent area that is 7 spaces wide and 3 spaces long.  All targets in this area have their minds themselves cloven in twain, and they each take 3 damage and must roll 1d3.  For that many actions they take, they must roll 1d3.  On a 1, they target the nearest ally instead of Jack O’ Lantern, as the visage of that ally is twisted into the worst thing that target can imagine."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Licorice Labyrinth,0,,"A forest of thick, tangled licorice sprouts from the ground in a pattern of Jack O’ Lantern’s choice.  It tastes fucking awful, and blocks the sight of those it surrounds.  It will be either fiery or icy in nature depending on the form Jack O’ Lantern is in.  Auto-success."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Autumn Harvest,0,,"Jack O’ Lantern rises high into the air, like a spectre of the night itself, and her scythe suddenly grows ten times larger.  She then slashes it across the combat arena six times, with each slash being treated as a separate action for the purposes of countering.  Each slash deals 3 damage and applies a stack of either a fire or a freezing effect.  Fire stacks will deal damage to the target at the start of their turn equal to their stacks, and the stack is then halved.  Freezing stacks will reduce a target’s movement by 1 for each stack.  These stacks are removed at the end of their turn."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Trick AND Treat,0,,"Jack O’ Lantern teleports behind a target of her choice and shoves her claws into their spine.  A portion of their soul is siphoned into her.  For one round, they cannot use 2 abilities of Jack O’ Lantern’s choice that she has seen them used.  They also take 6 damage and Jack O’ Lantern heals for 6 Stamina.  Auto-success."
ability,Jack O' Lantern,Pumpkin Palace,0,,"A massive pumpkin 6x6 spaces in size is created in the center of the arena.  This is a miniature version of Jack O’ Lantern’s castle, which has various FIRE and ICE and CANDY-BASED defenses.  The pumpkin can take one defensive action on each of Jack O’ Lantern’s turns until it is destroyed.  The pumpkin has 33 Stamina.  If Jack O’ Lantern switches forms while the pumpkin remains on the field, the pumpkin explodes and deals a ludicrous amount of damage to everyone in the arena except Jack O’ Lantern.  Auto-success."
weapon,Abyssia,Thousand Tentacles,,,"Dark as the sea itself, Abyssia’s tentacles lash out towards as many opponents as she wishes that are within 3 spaces of her.  For each enemy, she can choose one of the following options: Smash:  The enemy takes 8 damage and is knocked back a few spaces. Squeeze:  The enemy takes 4 damage and is restrained until they or one of their allies manages to free them from the tentacles.  This makes it much harder to perform certain actions and impossible to move. Sting:  A small tendril emerges from the tentacle’s tip and stabs the enemy, dealing 5 damage to them and applying a stack of ‘Love’ as corruptive energies enter their body.  Enemies with Love stacks have a -1 penalty to attack Abyssia per stack."
talent,Abyssia,The Ocean Itself,,,"Abyssia has Pokemon-esque strengths and weaknesses to certain attacks as though she were Water/Dark type.  She is completely immune to fire damage or burn effects, as well."
passive,Abyssia,Abyssal Pressure,,,"While fighting Abyssia, the very air around you becomes heavy as the deep ocean, and even taking a breath is a vicious struggle.  Everyone but her loses the ability to double-move, and must pay 1 Stamina to move any more than two spaces.  All Stamina costs of her allies and enemies are increased by 1. "
passive,Abyssia,Mesonychoteuthis Hamiltoni,,,"Some of Abyssia’s actions have additional effects that spread Ink throughout the combat arena.  When one of Abyssia’s enemies enters an area of Ink or starts their turn there, they take 3 damage and must roll to resist.  On a failure, they are blinded until the end of their next turn, meaning they have disadvantage on any roll that would usually require sight.  "
ability,Abyssia,Searing Drive,2,,"Abyssia draws in her tentacles around herself before suddenly charging forward at blinding speed, propelled by the strength of her countless tentacles.  Everyone in the 8 space line she charges through takes 8 damage and is knocked aside with the force of a volcanic geyser.  Enemies hit by this are also marked with a Burn effect that deals 1d2 damage at the start of each of their turns.  They get a roll to resist at the end of each of their turns."
ability,Abyssia,Cloud of Darkness,2,,Abyssia conjures a cloud of viscous Ink in a 4x4 space area she can see.   The cloud only lasts until the start of her next turn. This is a bonus action.
ability,Abyssia,Feeding Frenzy,5,,"Abyssia’s tentacles spread throughout the combat arena and begin searching for delicious morsels.  In 4 spaces of her choice, a Tentacle summon with 8 Stamina and 5 movement is created.  Each of them can use one of the options listed under her basic weapon on her turn.  A maximum of 10 tentacles can be in the arena at one time."
ability,Abyssia,Scarred Waters,2,,"With a wave of her hand, Abyssia draws on her corrupted energies to create 4 mines throughout the arena in spaces of her choice.

When a mine collides with someone, they take 2 damage and the mine takes 1 damage.

passive,Morpheus,Collective Unconscious,,,"Morpheus is slightly intangible, and possibly not even real. He can only be damaged by critical hits (or attacks that could thematically hit a dream/ghost), can fly, can teleport wherever he wants, is immune to sleep, and can read the minds and memories of everyone he sees. This is at the cost of enemies being able to move through you and rolling with disadvantage to manipulate non-sentient physical objects like doorknobs, or to pick things up. (this does not affect damaging enemies)"
ability,Morpheus,Seeing Double,1!,,"Create a clone of yourself… or have there always been two of you? When did the other one appear? It’s not clear.

ability,Morpheus,Id and Superego,1,,"Morpheus separates the nightmare half of him. They move separately but the normal one is the only one that can perform actions. As an anytime you can perform one of THESE, after which you recombine: - Cause a black hole to appear between the two of you, moving all enemies 5 spaces closer to the center point between them, and if they touch it they take 10 damage. - Freeze an enemy, halving their movement on their next movement action and dealing 2 damage. - Use Freudian Flip, for free. - Put a single enemy to sleep as if they were under the effects of Darkest Depths. A target needs two different targets hit between it before they can be hit by this again."
ability,Morpheus,Freudian Flip,2,,"Warp reality in a way that doesn’t have logical consistency, for example grass indoors, mirrors leading to other worlds, or causing some horrifying bullshit one might see in a nightmare."
ability,Morpheus,Darkest Depths,3⛯,,"Beam out darkness across the world, causing all enemies within 20 spaces to roll versus being put to sleep for 2 rounds.

talent,Teagan,Loser Extraordinaire,,,Teagan knows everything about any anime and has a strong opinion on it.
ability,Teagan,Dissociate,1!,,"When an attack is incoming, Teagan will dissolve into fog and go through the attack, avoiding the damage. This also teleports him somewhere. Once per round."
ability,Teagan,Foggy Memory,3,,"Teagan will extend an arm and cause a 3x3 area of Memory Fog to appear, clouding the judgement of anyone within. This causes them to forget a single ability of theirs for a round, being unable to use it. Even if they leave the fog it will still be gone until they’re out of the fog for a round."
ability,Teagan,Limericks of The Soul,3,,"Teagan reads some of his artful poetry that bares the deepest depths of his soul, which are all actually really terrible Limericks. Every word that is said by players while he is trying to read the Limerick causes their character to suffer 1 damage each. An effect based off of the Limerick happens like a mental incursion."
ability,Teagan,Begoneth Thine Vessel,1,,"As a bonus action Teagan can cause the players to have a bit of a mental blank, letting him turn invisible and move to a different location. An attack performed while invisible deals double damage and rolls with advantage. If Teagan takes damage or fails a roll he’ll go out of it. He can’t use Dissociate while in this state."
ability,Teagan,Trainwreck of Thought,1,,"As a bonus action Teagan creates 2-3 thin wires around the arena. The players are shown where they are initially, but they then disappear to the GM layer. The players can’t draw or leave markers on where they are. If they cross over one, it breaks and deals 4 damage."
ability,Teagan,Mental Block,1,,Teagan places a literal block made of mental energy. Teagan can pass through this easily but others treat is as a solid object.
ability,Teagan,Unfortunate Face,3,,"The temporary tattoo- I mean ""scar"" on top of Teagan's head makes him kind of look like a different person when his icon is turned upside down, so he's gonna do that to BeWlIdEr his enemies. They roll disadvantage to attack him until his next turn."
ability,Teagan,Precision Lobotomy,1,,"Teagan performs a dashing strike with Nevermore, traveling up to 12 spaces in a line. This deals 3 damage to a single target he passes through, and removes a memory of a single concept from them permanently."
weapon,Alterspinax,Dino-Mite Bite,,,"7 Damage, 1 Range. A big ol’ hefty dinosaur crunch."
talent,Alterspinax,Education Imbuing,,,"If an ally is in dire need to learn a mundane skill of some kind, Alterspinax is here to help! By quickly slapping an ally with its tail, Alterspinax can make them quickly learn a simple skill of any kind, lowering their DC to perform said action. Alterspinax cannot teach others skills directly useful for combat or skills that take an intense amount of training."
passive,Alterspinax,A Helping Claw,,,"Alterspinax is a gentle soul at heart, and always wishes for its teammates to succeed. Therefore, on Alterspinax’s turn, they can use half of all the damage they took rounded up within the last round and divide that amongst allies to heal them."

ability,Alterspinax,Polish Spine,3,,"Alterspinax rapidly grows one of the spines on its back and fires it at an ally within 6 range, boosting a numerical value on one of their stats by 2 (This includes current health). Once boosted, a stat cannot be boosted again by this ability."
ability,Alterspinax,Tooth and Nail,1,,"Alterspinax improves the toughness of one of their appendages and rushes 3 spaces into an opponent, slamming said appendage into them and dealing 5 damage."
weapon,Bakode-Draco,Binary Beam,,,"4 Damage, 6 Range. Bakode-Draco points its eel tail at a target, as a beam of pure data charges in its mouth and fires. This deals 4 damage initially, but because of the beam being made of semi-intangible code, the beam passes through the first target, and hits the next one for 1 less damage, and keeps going. However, all of the beam’s targets must be within 6 range."
talent,Bakode-Draco,Digital Coupon,,,Anything Bakode-Draco takes does not need to be paid for and any repercussions that come from taking things from the digital realm are entirely avoided.
passive,Bakode-Draco,Mastery Drive,,,"Bakode-Draco is rather unique in the fact that it’s made entirely of code. While it normally can interact with the world as if it were a completely physical object, on its turn as a free action it can transform into code and hop into a digital device within sight and reasonable distance, manifesting in that device’s digital realm. When inside a device, it can interact with the world as if it were a physical realm, and can affect things with its abilities and such. Additionally, it can bring out one digital thing from that device to the physical realm. This can keep happening, but a lot of action economy will have to be dedicated to bringing out numerous items, and the GM can just stop Bakode-Draco from doing this whenever."
ability,Bakode-Draco,System Update,X,,"Bakode-Draco takes a thing it has brought from the digital world and upgrades it in some way, paying variable stamina to do so. The more major the upgrade, the costlier the ability."
ability,Bakode-Draco,Digital Destabilization,1!,,"Using its digital influence, Bakode-Draco turns something into pure code, making it intangible to everything that is not also code, including itself. This ability has a +5 when targeting something that is already made of code (Bakode-Draco does not count for this). Once per round."
ability,Bakode-Draco,Along For the Ride,3⛯,,"Bakode-Draco takes a unit within one space and drags them into the digital realm with them as stated in the passive. This lasts for 2 rounds, where the two fight one on one, but of course Bakode-Draco has the advantage, being able to partially control the digital realm and all. Once per Combat."
weapon,Opablurria,Teeny Weeny Bite,,,"1 Damage, 1 Range. Opablurria’s not really meant to fight. It can sure try though! It just gives its foe a nip."
talent,Opablurria,Spatial Connection,,,"Opablurria has the interesting aspect of being able to share its sight and hearing with one of its allies, and this aspect can be willingly activated by said ally. Additionally, if the ally pays an extra stamina, they can have a weaker form of any of their abilities start at Opablurria’s range. The ally can also pass off this attribute to another one of their allies as a bonus action on their turn. When Opablurria is first summoned, this defaults to Copeland. "
passive,Opablurria,Nowhere in Sight,,,"Opablurra’s state of being is quite odd, as its existence seems to be very hard to detect. Even if it is out in the open, enemies will have to make a roll to see it, and actively want to look for something in order to make said roll. AOE damage is also completely ineffective against it. However, once it makes an attack against an opponent, they will immediately make a check to see it with a +5. Additionally, because of its state of existence, it is constantly floating, can phase through most things, and can maneuver itself in the air and water as normal."
ability,Opablurria,Skedoodle,0,,"This is a move action that can be made on Opablurria’s turn as a free action, which cannot fail. Look at it go!"
ability,Opablurria,Spirit Scan,1,,"Opablurria takes out a small purple wisp that quickly darts towards something and scans it up and down. This identifies a weakness in something, allowing Opablurria and whoever it is connected to to have a +3 on rolls when exploiting that weakness. The wisp will not give away Opablurria’s location or existence."
ability,Opablurria,Super Ambiguity,1!,,"Opablurria attempts to make itself more hidden by using its intangibility to phase through an attack! On 13+ rolls, it can go back into its hidden state, meaning an enemy will have to be attacked again to find it. Once per Round."
weapon,Parvidarian,Nettle Nip,,,"2 Damage, 1 Range. A teeny nip with a slight sting due to Parvidarian’s jellyfish biology."
talent,Parvidarian,Anemone Build,,,"Alongside their normal dinosaur build, Parvidarian also has the biology of anemone, with tentacles lining its back and suction pads on its feet.  This prevents unwanted forced movement from weaker or normal forms of forced movement, and all physical contact it takes and deals has a chance to apply Poison to its opponent (on 3 or lower rolls if it is hit, on 17+ rolls if it hits)."
passive,Parvidarian,Stinging Spirits,,,"At the start of combat, three ghostlike jellyfish fly out of Parvidarian and land in 3 places on the map. These jellyfish cannot be hit by enemies, as they’re mere spirit. The jellyfish primarily serve two purposes. First off, if an ally moves into a jellyfish, they can bounce off of it, giving themselves effectively an extra movement and can use the bounce to act as if they were moving midair, potentially boosting their attacks. Additionally, if any ally attacks move through a jellyfish, it coats it in a stinging poison, increasing its damage and allowing it to give a poison status, along with other poison-based properties one could think of. Each of the Jellyfish can have 1 space of movement on Parvidarian’s turn. If they’re in water, they have 6 spaces of movement. Once the Jellyfish are placed, they cannot be removed from the field, but cannot be moved if Parvidarian is not conscious or present."
ability,Parvidarian,Venomous Volleyball,1,,"Parvidarian, quick to action, flips in the air and lands on an adjacent Jellyfish. This launches it as it spins, turning it into a sort of volleyball, as it crashes into an opponent at maximum 20 spaces away, dealing 4-6 damage upon impact."
ability,Parvidarian,Nemato Lash,2,,"With a quick glance, Parvidarian activates a Jellyfish within its vision. This causes the Jellyfish to go haywire, attacking all units adjacent to it with its tentacles, dealing 5 damage and applying Poison. This has friendly fire."
ability,Parvidarian,Existence Reset,0!,,"In the instance when it is being knocked out, Parvidarian can harness a hidden power that can potentially make it immortal. Parvidarin explodes, scattering its polyp-like cells around the field, too small for the naked eye to see. At the start of Copeland’s next turn, Parvidarian reconstitutes in its previous position (Or the closest available position it can be in if it is unable to stay within that space), healed at full health. However, using this power multiple times in a single fight can be exhausting, and this after its initial use, the DC for this ability’s success goes up by 1 (Starting at a base failure range of 5 and below). When used by an ally via Now YOU Can Do The Dinosaur!, They heal for 1/4th their max stamina, and the DC increases by 2 for every usage."
weapon,Shamoscribe,Scribe Slam,,,"7 Damage, 2 Range. Shamoscribe swings its club tail, damaging an opponent and knocking them back 2 spaces on a 15+."
talent,Shamoscribe,Scribe Styles,,,"While Shamoscribe really only has one attack it does, which is swinging its tail at things, it is still able to adapt that style and perform many different variations off of one attack, each augmenting what it does on top of its Epithet applications. The styles Shamoscribe has so far are as follows: Rush Style - Using this style combines Shamoscribe’s main and move action into one. Shamoscribe rushes forward 6 spaces in a straight path, and hits a target for -3 its current basic attack damage. The speed of this attack increases the difficulty of anytime counters and dodges, negating minor successes. Rigid Style - Firmly planting its body to one spot, Shamoscribe hits an adjacent target with a +3 damage basic attack. Anytime counters and dodges are slightly easier to perform against this, however. Reach Style - Using this prevents Shamoscribe from taking its move action during the turn this was used on. Shamoscribe crouches down and spins, dealing -2 of its basic attack damage to all targets within the attack’s range radius around it. This technique is costly, forcing Shamoscribe to pay 2 extra stamina to perform it."
ability,Shamoscribe,ドど (Don),1,,"Once touched, the Inscription detonates, dealing 5 explosion damage in a 3x3 area centered around the point of detonation, and an additional 1-3 knockback depending on both the rolls to activate this ability and detonate the inscription. Inscription Application - While Shamoscribe’s brute force style of attacking can get it far, it’s able to apply an additional bit of Epithet power to boost its capabilities. after a successful basic attack, if it chooses to do so, Shamoscribe may roll to apply an “Inscription” to all applicable targets. Inscriptions do nothing inherently, but when touched by something that is not Shamoscribe itself, its effect will immediately activate. Getting rid of these Inscriptions are harder than normal debuffs, but the higher one is above Copeland’s prof, the easier it is to accomplish depending on the method of getting rid of it."
ability,Shamoscribe,コソ (Koso),1,,"Once touched, the Inscription seems to suck in all of the sound around it before dissipating. This makes it so for the next round, the 3x3 area around the Inscription is converted into an area of total silence. No sounds can leave or enter. If a unit starts their turn within this area, they take 1d2 unnerved damage, as complete silence is something utterly unnatural to the average human. Inscription Application - While Shamoscribe’s brute force style of attacking can get it far, it’s able to apply an additional bit of Epithet power to boost its capabilities. after a successful basic attack, if it chooses to do so, Shamoscribe may roll to apply an “Inscription” to all applicable targets.

ability,Shamoscribe,ざわ (Zawa),3,,"Once touched, a blackish-purple mist begins flowing around the Inscription, creating a 3x3 area around the user for the next round. This mist causes anyone within it to feel an immense amount of dread, reducing rolls by -4 and reducing the effectiveness of successful attacks slightly. Inscription Application - While Shamoscribe’s brute force style of attacking can get it far, it’s able to apply an additional bit of Epithet power to boost its capabilities. after a successful basic attack, if it chooses to do so, Shamoscribe may roll to apply an “Inscription” to all applicable targets.

talent,Absinthe,We’ll Have to Keep You in For Surgery,,,"Whenever Absinthe successfully attacks a target she may follow up with some basic surgery...y’know...with her weapon. If she hits someone with an AoE she may only follow up surgery on one target within range. Once per round. (10) In ‘N’ Out Surger - After making a successful basic attack through her talent “We’ll Have To Keep You In For Surgery” Absinthe can do some actual quick surgery to that target slightly modifying a part of their body in a way of her choice, they also gain an additional malpractice point. The roll she made for the attack also doubles as her surgery roll which determines how long this modification lasts, at maximum it lasts till the end of combat. Absinthe cannot be modified herself in this way even with a nat 1."
passive,Absinthe,Medical Negligence,,,"Whenever Absinthe attempts to heal a target they aren’t always how they were before. If they roll high then they get extra stamina back, if they do an average job then the target of the healing has a chance to gain a malpractice point. For every malpractice point a target has they take +1 damage. If she fails a healing roll the target will always get a malpractice point. Absinthe cannot get malpractice points herself. She can use her abilities to overheal but will always guarantee a malpractice point."
passive,Absinthe,Patient List,,,Everytime Absinthe (or one of her “assistants” (Phil)) knocks out or even kills someone she can add them to her patient list. If she is in combat with someone on her patients list they start combat with 1 malpractice point. Not even death can save you.
ability,Absinthe,"Hihi, Let’s Get You Patched Up",1!,,Absinthe picks a target adjacent to her and uses one of the needles stabbed into her body and some stitching and patches someone right up. They heal for 4 stamina. If used on an enemy they heal for 2 and get a guaranteed malpractice point. Once per round
ability,Absinthe,Shishishishishi,2!,,"Opening up her bloodied maw from behind her bandages and rushing towards a target, Absinthe bites into them with her sharp teeth and rips out their essence. She heals herself for every malpractice point they have. This deals 4 damage and removes malpractice points. If it is used on allies it only deals damage if the base damage is more than their malpractice points. Once per round."
ability,Absinthe,Professional Diagnosis,2,,Absinthe looks at her patients and gives them her professional opinion in their present condition. She does this by opening her mouth and producing an eldritch scream dealing 4 damage to every enemy around her. Distance variable.
weapon,Accel,Why Would I Need a Weapon?,,,"Accel touches a target and adjusts velocity of various components of their body dealing internal damage. This deals damage even if the target has nothing internal to speak of or has a weird body constitution, additionally any passive effects that may be incurred by touching the target do not occur, good or bad. 1 Range. 4 Damage."
passive,Accel,Reflection of Vectors,,,"Accel constantly covers her entire body in a barrier that reverses the vector of anything that comes towards her, adjusting just enough for basic living needs. Once per turn, Accel can reflect one melee based or one projectile based attack. If a melee attack is reflected the attacker is pushed back one space and is dealt 1 stamina damage. If a projectile attack is reflected it is shot back towards a target of Accel’s choosing as long as they are within the direction the attack was shot from. This can even affect sound, light and heat. This kind of stuff can not be reflected back however. Hyper Calculation Speed - Reflection Of Vectors is now once per turn."
ability,Accel,Kinetic Vector,2,,Accel can touch a target and forcibly change the magnitude of their vectors sending them in any direction they want. Size of the target is irrelevant.

weapon,Adeline,Deck of Cards,,,"A deck of card. All of them Aces. Each suit has a different effect. Rolls a d4 to determine which card she gets at the start of her turn. In order as presented. Hearts - Range 4 - Damage 0 - Heals for 3. Can be used on allies. Clubs - Range 2 - Damage 5 - The heaviest hitter of the deck. Watch out, they’re heavy. Diamonds - Range 5 - Damage 2 - 3 cards are thrown and can hit any enemy in range. But not the same enemy more than once and only in one direction (like a cone). Spades - Range 6 - Damage 4 - Can only be thrown in a cardinal direction, pierces through enemies but deals less damage for each enemy hit. Jabberwock - By paying 1 stamina Adeline may use two cards from her deck by having one of them be a bonus action. Hearts - By paying one stamina, Adeline may split the healing to another target as well. If she does this she is able to use her talent to swap any of the targets and herself to any of their positions. Spades - By paying 2 stamina, Adeline throws out a powered up Ace Of Spades. It deals full damage to every enemy hit and leaves them with a burn effect. Diamonds - By paying 1 stamina, Adeline can throw out her Ace Of Diamonds out all around her up to 6 spaces away, hitting the first enemy in each direction for the weapons damage. Clubs - Adeline pays 2 stamina and reveals why the Ace of Clubs is so heavy, she throws the card out up to 4 spaces and deals a measly 1 damage. But as the enemy is confused by this she rushes up and hits them with a heavy black metal hobby horse with orange flaming eyes for 6 damage and 3 knockback, this is hard to counter, interfere with or dodge."
talent,Adeline,Mad Tea Party,,,"If Adeline heals an ally she can change places with them and if she does, gains a portion of the healing she gave. Jabberwock Eye - Whenever Adeline is healed by anyone she can swap places with them, this effect is gained automatically and for free if she activates it. If she pays stamina on this, her target or the one targeting her has +1 crit range on everything for the round as a new eye appears on their head."
talent,Adeline,Explorer at Heart,,,"Adeline’s years exploring (being lost) in The Wanderlands have given her an acute sense for the weird and deciphering the meaning. She gets advantage on investigation, research and perception checks with a +1 crit range. Jabberwock Eye - By paying 1 stamina Adeline is able to see through illusions, transformations and invisibility, seeing the true form of everything should she wish too as a third eye literally appears on her face. If she still needs to make a roll when relating to this she does so at advantage with a +1 crit range."
talent,Adeline,The Jabberwock Eye,,,"Adeline’s encountered many creatures in The Wanderlands and none have been more dangerous than The Jabberwock. She only just managed to get away with her life, but she did, and she got their fucking eye.

(42) Snicker Snack - Adeline’s expanded crit range now applies to all her rolls. She also now crits naturally and gains proficiency on every Nat 20 and Nat 19 she rolls, meaning her crit range starts assuming 19 is already a crit. Natural crit range of 16+. Jabberwock Eye - Adeline hits hard and slices and dices through anything she can if she must. When she hits an enemy with an attack she can spend a stamina to mark them, for the rest of combat everyone targeting them with attacks has +1 crit range against them, this goes to a max of 3 stacks. This can stack so long as Adeline pays a stamina for every stack they have on them already."
passive,Adeline,Vorpal Heart,,,"Adeline is learning to connect her heart with others once more. As a bonus action on her turn, Adeline can give up certain amounts of her crit range to gain or grant various buffs. This usually only lasts for 1-2 rounds with her choosing whether or not to regain it at the start of her next turn. She can only gain or grant a single type of buff from this passive per round. She can only give buffs to allies within 3 spaces. She can take the crit range from anywhere in her kit. Blunt Bonus - Adeline can exchange crit range for roll buffs. She can give herself a +2 for every crit range she gives up. Or an ally a +3 for each. Heal Bonus - Adeline can exchange crit range for stamina. She can heal herself 2 stamina for each crit range she gives up. Or an ally for 3 stamina for each. Crit range comes back after 2 rounds. Damage Bonus - Adeline can exchange crit range for damage. She can give herself 1 extra damage on everything she does for every crit range she gives up. Or an ally can gain 2 damage on everything for each. Range - Adeline can exchange crit range for range. She can give herself an extra 1 range on everything she has for every crit range she gives up. Allies still only get 1 range per crit range given up. Movement - Adeline can exchange crit range for movement. She can give herself an extra 2 movement for every crit range she gives up. Allies still only get 2 movement per crit range given. Action - Adeline can exchange crit range for an action. She can give up all of her available crit range to grant herself or an ally an extra main action on their current/next turn. This also costs her 2 stamina to do. Crit range comes back after 2 rounds. Jabberwock Eye - Whenever Adeline gives up crit range she gains a stack of “Weirdness” she can spend 7 weirdness to apply the wild magic table to one piece of either her own or an ally’s kit. This remains for the rest of the session."
passive,Adeline,[STAND] The Masquerade,,,"Adeline calls upon her stand, which manifests as a Masquerade Mask and a second ornate vorpal blade. She can attack with the vorpal blade straight up as a weapon attack that has the same effects as her normal Vorpal Blade, she can also do this as a swift action for half damage (before crit multiplier). She must pay 1 stamina as upkeep to keep this in effect. Jabberwock Eye Effect - By paying an extra 2 stamina Adeline is able to use her blade to cut through reality itself and even metaphysical/meta conceptual things to an extent and she gets a +1 crit range to do so. If it is something represented on the map such as assets or even 3D dice she must be adjacent to it to do so. She can choose to hold this swift action to use as an anytime action."
ability,Adeline,The Vorpal Blade,2,,Adeline’s treasured weapon that goes snicker-snack and leaves ‘em dead. Adeline attacks with her blade. Deals 4 Damage and gains +1 crit. (36) “Vorpal Blade” Gains an additional +2 damage and +1 Crit. Jabberwock Eye - By paying an extra 2 stamina Adeline is able to use her blade to cut through reality itself and even metaphysical/meta conceptual things to an extent and she gets a +1 crit range to do so. If it is something represented on the map such as assets or even 3D dice she must be adjacent to it to do so.
ability,Adeline,Drink Me!,1!,,"Adeline drinks that purple stuff and shrinks down to a mere 10 inches. She can use this as an anytime to dodge an attack but will stay that size till her next turn. While shrunk she will take more damage but will be harder to hit and deal less damage herself (damage reduction does not apply to attacks not physically made by her, e.g. Queen of Hearts or Infernal Train). Can be used out of combat for no stamina cost. Once per round. 21 - “Drink Me!” Effects last until Adeline’s Next Turn, not one full round. Out of combat she can use it without stamina cost. Jabberwock Eye - By paying an extra 2 stamina the Jabberwock’s weird energies reverse the effect of the potion and Adeline instead becomes a 3x3 giant till the end of her next or current turn. This doesn’t make her harder to hit like the original but instead gives her resistance to damage as it becomes somewhat meaningless to her new large body. But this does increase her own damage by 3."
ability,Adeline,Infernal Train,3⛯,,"Adeline summons the nightmare train of several smoking cathedrals to run through, it deals damage to a 3xInfinite space, can hit both allies and enemies. Does a lot of damage, it is a train. The train must run adjacent to the space she is on and crits with this ability allow allies to be immune to it’s damage. Once per Combat. Jabberwock Eye - The Infernal train goes throughout the arena as normal, except this time an unsettling and monstrous roar is heard as atop the train a giant dragon is attacking it causing it to derail through the other side and back into The Wanderlands. The dragon however is still here, this is the Jabberwock, a giant 6x6 unsettling and creepy dragon with only one eye and a scar over the other. The Jabberwock recognises Adeline as themselves due to the energies emitting from her and the disorientation from being in a train wreck and as such will listen to her commands. They have a 10 damage, 8 range basic attack in the form of a rainbow laser they shoot from their mouth in a line and can somewhat influence the flow of time as an anytime action. They do not have a stamina value and will go back to The Wanderlands after 2 rounds. Adeline’s train becomes unusable for the rest of the session and instead becomes a 6 cost once per combat to summon The Jabberwock, but each consecutive time they are summoned they become harder for Adeline to control as they start to recognise her."
ability,Adeline,Through the Looking Glass,2!,,"Adeline summons a mirror. It cannot be used until 2 mirrors have been placed. Once 2 or more mirrors have been placed Adeline can then travel between them as part or all of movement or as an anytime. She must be adjacent or become adjacent to do it. Once per round. (51) A Skip And A Hop Through The Mirror - This ability is now a twice per round. And any ally can use them/send attacks through them. Adeline herself once per round can attempt to send anything through there if she is adjacent to a mirror. Allies may now pass through the mirrors for the cost of an extra movement. Jabberwock Eye - When Adeline makes a mirror, she can pay 2 extra stamina to lock it in its current location but she can also give it the ability to “see”. Allowing her to create an exact copy of an action, attack or ability that has passed adjacent to that mirror as an X cost, once per round, anytime action, so long as the target is within 10ft of this mirror or adjacent to another. Only 1 of these mirrors can be set at a time. Copied actions etc. can only be done once per time it has passed by and can not be done with OPC, Outclasses and Overclasses. Stamina cost is the cost of the action -1 to a minimum of 0."
ability,Adeline,Down the Rabbit Hole,1,,"Adeline takes an object, either from the area or on her possession, and yeet it through either her own Wanderland Portal or Through The Looking Glass and have it come out with Wanderland energies transforming or weirdifying it in some way (Adeline usually has *some* control of how it’ll turn out as she chooses where it passes through). This weirdification can affect others in strange ways if they touch the object, except Adeline who’s used to it. (55) Weird The Rabbit Hole - Adeline can now pull out any small object of her choosing when using this ability and can pay an extra stamina to throw 2 items instead, they may exit from different portals but they must have the same effect on them. Jabberwock Eye - By paying 1 stamina Adeline can have the object she threw appear out of 2 mirrors simultaneously, potentially with different effects entirely. How does she do this? Dunno, but that third eye on her forehead probably has something to do with it."
ability,Adeline,Critical Blessings,1!,,"Adeline can give a blessing to an ally that allows them to reroll an action with an additional +1 crit range that lasts until they succeed a roll. She may also use this when an ally succeeds a roll to give them a +2 to their crit range until they get a successful roll or if this would result in them getting a crit, they cannot gain proficiency through this unless it is a Nat 20. Once per round. Jabberwock Eye Effect - The affected target can choose to pay an upkeep of 1 stamina on their turn to keep their crit range at +1. This upkeep increases for every stack of crit range they have from this ability by 1."
weapon,Ashlee,Ice Cream Spoon,,,"Ashlee has to get resourceful to stop nerdowells from messing with the ice cream cart or the innocent kids and civilians trying to enjoy from it. Shockingly, she’s so brutal with this that it deals 7 damage at 1 range. Like… holy shit girl."
talent,Ashlee,Lemme Guess,,,"Ashlee tends to understand her customers well, and it’s quite a selling point that makes her a valued employee. Once per person, Ashlee can attempt to guess someone’s favorite ice cream flavor! She can’t know already before guessing, and she gets no retries! If she’s accurate, she gets +1 proficiency!"
talent,Ashlee,Ice Cream Sense,,,Ashlee herself can immediately detect the presence of icecream within a 50 foot radius.
passive,Ashlee,What Would You Like?,,,"Ashlee is on the job still. As such, she’s always inside her Friendly Scoops ice cream cart! This cart provides all the cool air conditioning one would need to survive even the hottest of heats, as well as provide virtually infinite ice cream! She can serve scoops to allies to heal them for like 2-3 stamina, performing it as a bonus action once per turn (not round) to a willing ally that is in front of the place. This is in exchange for money, but her rates are pretty cheap actually! The cart is also reinforced with anti-epithet titanium so it’s literally just indestructible and immune to epithet-based abilities, which makes it near impossible to hit her. She can move the cart around at her movement speed from within. (44) - Healing Ice Cream increased by 1."
ability,Ashlee,"I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream for Ice Cream!",3⛯,,"Once per combat, Ashlee can turn on the infectious ice cream song. This causes everyone, no matter how evil or motivated, to stop what they’re doing and run over to eat some ice cream! Everyone takes a small 5 minute break to roleplay the ice cream they wall buy, and while they eat it they small talk with everyone else. Everyone also rolls a 1d8 to determine how much they heal! It’s all in a day’s work."
ability,Ashlee,"I’ll Warn You Kid, They’re Not as Good as They Look in The Art... ",1,,"Ashlee pulls out some of the premade ice creams they have as ads on the side of her cart. They’re supposed to be of existing properties like Spongebob or maybe a member of DBA whose popular, but unfortunately the ads are a little misleading. The actual ice creams are kind of… terrifying? With this you can give a willing target one of these, which heals another 2-3 stamina and grants them a small effect or ability relating to the fictional character. The downside? It’s often kinda scary, which has a 50% chance to fear the target upon opening the wrapper, making them get -3 on their rolls for a while as they block out the bad thoughts."
ability,Ashlee,Business To Attend To,1,,"This ability can only be used if you haven’t attacked anyone or left your cart this combat. Basically, you perform some personal task to help sort out your confusing life using a laptop and some notebooks in your cart. It’s good to be organized! This gives the rest of your rolls this combat a +1, and this effect can stack."
weapon,Azula,Witch Judo,,,"Magic isn’t the only thing I know. Azula can either judo punch, judo kick or judo chop an adjacent target for 6 damage or she can judo grapple the enemy and judo hold them in place for 2 judo damage but they cannot use anytimes till their next turn or judo throw them to the ground for 4 damage and they have to spend their movement to get up on their turn."
talent,Azula,Premium Ghostions,,,"Azula has a limitless amount of her homemade ghost potions (or Ghotions for short). They can have various effects that usually result in +1 to various things for a round. They can be modified by things Azula finds around the place (or even people) to give extra, enhanced or different effects. She can consume one herself as a bonus action on her turn or an ally can ask her for one on their turn if they are adjacent to her. While Azula (and other spiritual lifeforms) can consume them without any negative effects, regular humans will have to pay stamina to drink them again."
passive,Azula,A Very Wispy Witch,,,Azula is a half wisp along with being a witch and as such her body constantly shifts between states of corporeality allowing her to move through walls and fly. Although her flight is limited to only up to a few feet in the air (although she can float over gaps and such) and she is able to freely move through both enemies and allies. She also has 1⁄4DR (rounded down to a minimum of 1) against physical attacks.
ability,Azula,Blend Realities,1!,,"Using the ambiguity of her magic and epithet Azula is able obscure the perception of things. This can include, but is not limited to, people and object’s positions/actions, general light levels or even senses of balance. Due to her wisp-like nature she has advantage when targeting herself. Once per round."
ability,Azula,Owl-Lights,3,,"The combat area reaches a state of semi-darkness as hundreds of purple lights scatter themselves around. For the next 3 rounds the lights stay around and Azula may have the lights converge on a target either dealing 5 damage to a single target or healing a target for 5 stamina. She may do this as a bonus action on her turn, it is free for the first time but costs 2 stamina each subsequent use. Anyone attempting to target Azula (except herself), ally or enemy, rolls at a disadvantage. This ability cannot be used for 2 rounds after it dissipates. "
ability,Azula,Wisp Flame,2,,"Azula creates a small purple flame and sends it out. It acts as a light source and allies can send small projectiles through it. Azula is able to move from one wisp to another but it will cost her remaining movement to do so. She may only have 3 wisps out at a time but she can control one on her turn as a free bonus action. She can use this control to have them orbit her; they still count towards the total but will automatically take the next hit Azula would receive, if it is ranged she has to roll but if it’s at melee range she does not, regardless the wisp dissipates afterwards. Enemies that come into contact with the flame will take 2 damage and receive a spirit burn (1d6 burn every round, can be resisted or soothed but the first time is rolled at a disadvantage) the flame will then disappear. "
weapon,Belle,Himawari,,,"Belle’s trusty weapon. Himawari is a transforming tool that has a lot of fun functions that not even Belle has unlocked yet. It’s base state is a palm sized disc that turns into a fashionable and form fitting glove that deals 3 damage at 1 range with 1 knockback. The second form is a simple pole with a ring at the end of it, she can use it at 3 range for 2 damage and on rolls of 14+ trap a target within the ring (so long as they are 1x1 in size) before pulling them in and hitting them with the fist form. Heart Burst - Belle is now able to leave a pink energy heart on a target she punches, this heart doesn’t do anything passively (unless charged with Rainbow Power) but she can, as an anytime action detonate the heart to deal the basic attack damage to the target +1 and heal any of her own allies that are within 2 spaces of the target by half the damage dealt. This deals no damage until the heart is burst, though any knockback still goes through. She does need to roll to punch and activate the anytime, though the activation is done so with advantage."
talent,Belle,Commander and the Leader,,,"Belle’s presence as a powerhouse and her ability to stay cool under pressure, even if she sometimes doesn’t look it, gives people a feeling of wanting to rally under her and help her out. Not being one to take without giving back, Belle will assist those in need or who want to help her back. This creates a two way system where someone assisting Belle has a +2 to rolls and when Belle assists someone she gains advantage. This does not put people under her control and the assistance she makes or receives must be direct (eg. A reroll, heal, dual tech or interrupt would count, but just damaging an enemy or moving something out of the way would not). This is also added onto her class name when obtained and cannot be removed. Proficiency can be put into this talent to gain unique upgrades. It starts at 0. (5) - **We Can Do This!** - Belle gains a +3 to inspiring speeches! (8) - **Let’s Work Together!** - If someone gets a Nat20 while helping Belle she gains a proficiency in this talent and they gain +1 max stamina in addition to other rewards they might get for that kind of thing. If Belle gets Nat20 to help someone this talent gets a prof in addition to the normal prof gain and she gets +1 Companionship with them (if she is helping multiple people, she may only pick 1). "
talent,Belle,I Can Do This Too!,,,"Belle has various super powered invulnerabilties due to...reasons. As such she is resistant to or completely immune to certain environmental effects such as extreme temperatures including but not limited to lava, the vacuum of space, the arctic, the deep ocean and the desert. This includes being able to breathe in space and underwater or the equivalent. This does not grant her immunity to attacks or damage from or caused by others, nor resistance. Unless they are creating a passive environmental effect to be happening (eg, causing a heatwave, removing all the air from an area, turning the entire place into a tundra)."
passive,Belle,Rainbow Power,,,"At the start of combat Belle feels energy run through her body and new powers spring forth, generating three random superpowers. Not only is she capable of using these powers naturally on their own as a main action (with relevant stamina costs), but she is also able to combine the essence of these powers into her own kit as well by paying an additional 1-5 stamina depending on the strength of the superpower. There is a catch however, when these powers are generated she only has limited usage of them before the energy that produced them fades away. She has an upper usage limit of 10 and stronger powers may utilise more of this usage, though it can be supplemented with stamina cost. The default usage and minimum usage is 1. (21) Belle may spend a stamina to reroll any one of her super powers up to twice per combat. In addition, she regenerates 1 at the start of her turn. Out of combat Belle may spend 1 stamina to roll 3 superpowers and pick one to be able to use, only one superpower may be active in this way at a time."
ability,Belle,Hyper Caramel Blast!,1!,,"Power charges up in Belle’s hands as she fires out a ball of energy at a target up to 6 spaces away. When the ball hits it’s target, it explodes into a heart shaped blast that deals 4 damage to an enemy or heals an ally for 3 stamina. This then creates a sweet smelling aura around the target that extends out 5ft, enemies in that aura have a -2 to their rolls and allies in that aura have a +2 to their rolls. The aura lasts for 1 round. Once per round. (24) If Belle naturally rolls a 14+ on this ability she regains 3 Power Charge back. She can now use this ability on herself but weakened, gaining either the aura OR the heal."
ability,Belle,Rolling Burst Drive!,2,,"Energy flaring up below her burst out as she flies up several feet into the air and in an arc over to a target within 7 spaces of her leaving a trail of bubbles behind her that disappear as she moves. While flying she starts to spin rapidly and once she reaches her target she hits them with a superpowered rolling axe kick, burying them cartoonishly into the ground and dealing 6-8 damage. 19 - After landing the axe kick with Rolling Burst Drive! Belle backflips away and lands up to 3 spaces away from the target and if she rolled a 15+ she can attempt to make a basic attack on a target in range or use “Rainbow Power” to perform a main action."
ability,Belle,Powered Stomp Shoot!,3,,"Belle stomps down on the ground creating a shockwave of energy at her feet that spreads up to 3 spaces and deals 3 damage to all adjacent units and then only to enemies from there outwards and leaving giant star shaped burn marks across the ground. This also loosens any kind of structures from their foundations (including the ground itself) allowing her to then follow-up this shockwave by lifting an object up to 4x4 in size and hurling it up to 8 spaces forwards in a line for roughly 9-13 damage, but it could be more or less depending on the object thrown. Belle may lift and throw anything of up to a 4x4 size without doing the shockwave, as a main action using this ability. The follow up throw is once per combat."
ability,Belle,Powered Megaton Punch!,2,,"Belle’s super powered energies condense around her fist and she performs a single immense punch against a single target. The target of this punch immediately takes 6 damage and is pushed back or in the air up to 7 spaces. Then, at the end of the target’s next turn they take an additional 6 damage. If Belle charges her superpowers into this attack, not only can she put in more power for less cost but it retains the power put into it for the second hit, applying an effect of Belle’s choice based on the power she charged into it."
weapon,Hope,Big Fucking Teeth,,,5 damage 1 range. (24) She can use this as a bonus action for half damage when grappling.
talent,Hope,Void Stomach,,,"Hope can eat just about anything and will. Hope can pick things up from the map and shove them in her mouth as a free bonus action to heal herself. Healing is dependent on the thing and GM. Once per round. Limited to small and medium sized things, takes multiple turns to eat larger things."
talent,Hope,Gotta Have a Good Meal,,,"Hope knows that it’s very important to have three meals in one day. However, that isn’t going to stop her from aiming for even more meals after that! After successfully landing three attacks with her teeth, her dessert will be her dealing double damage on her next teeth based attack."
passive,Hope,Just Like Resident Evil,,,"Hope can grapple and jump onto anyone, she gains bonus attacking her grappled target. Grappled targets have reduced movement and must bring Hope with them, but she can be removed by force or if convinced someone else is a better target.

Up to GM disression, either combining, combining into one word, things like that. Can also eat it for herself for the same effect. Once per Combat. (42). Throwing Up Everything but the Kitchen Sink - If Hope eats an item at any point during a session, she can use Spit-Up to reuse said item as the component for her spit. Through this, the target’s Epithet/Core Word is now fused with whatever that object was. If she wants, she can simply cough up the item and use it on its own as a free action. (52) Can’t Stop at One Bite! - Spit-Up can now be used twice per combat."
ability,Hope,Consume,2,,"Hope bites her current grappled target for 3 damage and healing for 60% damage done. She then sinks her teeth into the target causing their epithet to go haywire and giving it a chance to misfire horribly unless they pay an extra 3 stamina to alleviate the effect. If they choose to pay the stamina it is automatically consumed by Hope healing her for 3. Prof 16. Predator’s Lunge - When using Consume, Hope can now activate it from up to two spaces away from a unit in order to grapple onto them instantly. Prof 38. -1 Cost (To 2)"

In times like these, Hope likes to use this ability to transform any hole/orifice she has seen into a pair of munchers. This new mouth has a tongue that can be shot up to 2 spaces away from the mouth’s origin, and anything it latches onto gets pulled into the maw. If the object is small enough or the mouth is big enough, it can swallow its target(s) whole in order to heal Hope for a small amount of stamina and add to her void of a stomach. Otherwise, it deals 2 bite damage at the start of a grabbed unit’s turn, as well as 3 on its initial bite. Once per round. (44).

weapon,Penny,"Scissors, Lots of Scissors",,,"Penny has an unreasonable amount of craft materials and tools on her at all times, most of all though she has scissors. These can be used for almost any purpose but most of the time she just throws them. 3 Damage - 5 Range.

Penny is exceedingly dextrous using them, being able to swing them around with ease. Avante-Garde deals 7 damage at 2 range and when being used Penny can spend 1 stamina to cut through objects and things in the way. If she does this, the material she cuts through has it’s properties stored within the scissors which she can then use to be applied to her weapon attacks or used to make cutouts. She may also spend 1 stamina to add the properties of a random cutout into the blades, she may only store 3 things in the blades at a time. "
talent,Penny,The Destructive Ring of Set,,,"A fragment of the god of chaos and violence is sealed within this slightly cursed artifact. The Lord of Red Sands may augment actions of the wearer should they wish it, or if they critically fail he will intervene and force them to try again. If he is being invoked in an action on purpose the action has +1 cost, gains general destructive properties, increasing damage done by 1d4. If he forces intervention you pay +3 cost (initial cost is not repaid), and reroll your action. The damage from forced “help” is 2d4, and if used on something which generally ‘creates’ it instead destroys, effectively inverting the effect in some way."
passive,Penny,Crafty Fan,,2,"Penny is a big fan of DBA and uses her expertise in arts & crafts to excellent work making cutouts of the competitors, but with her epithet she can breathe a small amount of life into them. Cutouts she makes have 3 stamina, 0 movement and 1 aspect of that character’s character sheet (be that an ability, talent or passive). The cutouts do not spend stamina on anything they do but they must follow the usage rule of the aspect they take but they share anytime usage. The cutouts can be picked up and moved as a free action, act as cover for her and her allies and if they have an ability that explicitly need extra requirements to work they are automatically fulfilled. Penny can only have 3 cutouts out simultaneously and are made at the proficiency of the original character at the time and do not automatically upgrade with the original character (27 - One cutout has a separate main action to Penny herself) (36 - Your cardboard cutouts now have a base 4 stamina instead of base 3. Does not apply to Cardboard Penny or Danny DeVito) (66 - Your max cutout limit is now 5) Multitasker- At the start of combat Penny can choose a character and immediately starts crafting a cutout of that character. This continues in the background while combat is going on and usually completes within 2-3 rounds, but she can roll as a bonus action on her turn to try and complete it faster. Once the cutout is finished she can spend 3 stamina to summon it immediately. She can then pick another character in combat to start making a cutout of. At the end of combat she can pay 1 max stamina per cutout to add them to her list permanently, if she is currently in the middle of making one she must pay 1-2 max stamina to complete and add it to her list. Out of combat she can start making cutouts whenever she pleases but only one at a time and she must still pay 1 max stamina to add it permanently. She can not create direct copies of copies. New Material - Whenever Penny creates a cutout or item, instead of making it out of cardboard, she can use any material within 5 spaces of her, this may give the cutouts extra effects, buffs or otherwise depending on the material. Whenever Penny takes damage, she can redirect any amount of damage she wants to a single cutout. She cannot redirect damage to multiple cutouts from one attack, nor can she redirect more damage to a cutout than they have stamina to lose. (47) You can now redirect damage to multiple cutouts using “Protect Me, Heroes!”."
ability,Penny,Total Recraft,2!,,"Penny can create a cutout she has previously made randomly from her list. If this fails she gets a bonus to the next time she does it. Once per round. (54) Once per combat, you may reroll a cutout you are making to turn it into something else from your list."

ability,Penny,Item Commission,2,,"Penny puts her prop making knowledge to good work and makes a simple item of her choice, but that’s not all she can then imbue the item with the powers of one of her already summoned cutouts or a random cutout from her list (when she rolls randomly for this she rolls with advantage and picks the one she wants). The items stays around for as long as she wants but she cannot use this ability to create a new item when one already exists, she can instead use this ability to improve upon the existing item, including imbuing it with more things from her list. An item can only be imbued twice. Items usually disappear at the end of combat but any of her allies can pay max stamina to keep the item as part of their kit permanently, max stamina cost is dependent on the item but is usually at minimum 3-5. (An item added to a kit permanently can not be upgraded so Penny can still use this ability if there is one present and Penny herself cannot add this new item to her kit permanently)"
ability,Penny,It's A Cardboard Me,4!,,"When an attack is coming towards her, Penny quickly constructs a cardboard version… of herself! This cutout takes all of the damage from the incoming attack for her, dying in the process. If it doesn’t die from the damage or is just for some reason still around, Penny can choose to either incinerate it or choose to keep it on the field as a cutout for the new up and coming DBA star: herself! Cardboard Penny also has 3 stamina and cannot use anytime actions but can instead perform its own main action on Penny’s turn, this main action can be used to assist Penny with crafting/making stuff, summoning a new cutout or using one of her non-anytime, non-OPC abilities (this does not consume her cutout main action). Penny cannot give Cardboard Penny an aspect of her own kit aside from what is mentioned. If Cardboard Penny is on the field then actual Penny loses access to this ability, until she’s gone. Penny is also not vain enough to create a copy of herself unless absolutely necessary, so she can only use it if it were to block damage from an attack. Once per round."
ability,Penny,Crafter's Arsenal,3⛯,,"Penny unleashes a wave of crafting materials upon every enemy within 20 feet of her. Enemies hit by this are suddenly restrained and take 6 damage by all the glue, ribbons, paper, scissors and various other materials that were thrown out around her. When the glitter settles Penny is nowhere to be found a cutout of her choice is left in her place. Penny reappears on her next turn in a place her movement would allow her to go to. Once per Combat."
weapon,Queenie,Giant Honey Twirler,,,"Queenie’s very own honey twirler, it’s pretty big. 6 damage at 1 Range. (29) +1 Range to 2 (43) When Queenie swings her Honey Twirler, Honey has a chance to fly off of it and sticking to whatever was in that direction (actually hitting results in this being a significantly higher chance). Hitting an enemy with this honey slows their movement while they are covered in it and causes things to stick to them more easily. (May also attract animals and other insects, bee careful) "
talent,Queenie,Hexagons! The Perfect Shape!,,,"Hexagons lock together for extreme durability, Queenie's outfit acts as a hive made of hexagon shaped honeycombs, allowing her to take less damage from blunt attacks, but take more from piercing attacks. (23) Queenie no longer takes extra damage from piercing attacks."
talent,Queenie,We Are Going To BEEat You To Death,,,"Queenie starts every combat with 2 bees of her choice and she can bring in bees that survive previous combats and still get the 2 new ones, except the dracobee or dracobeelings. In addition Bees she summons can be summoned up to 3 spaces away from her. When gaining this upgrade for the first time she gets to summon two bees of her choice for free, this goes above her summon limit if it can."
talent,Queenie,Movement Queen,,,Queenie gets a second movement action on her turn and she may use one of her abilities or her basic weapon on her turn as a movement action.
passive,Queenie,Rad Bee Wings,,,"Queenie has rad bee wings sprouting from her back, these allow her to move 1.5x her normal movement they also allow her to avoid ground based obstructions. But are not strong enough for sustained flight. (52) New Laws of Aviation -  Queenie’s Bee Wings grow in strength allowing her to fly unhindered and is now 2x movement instead of 1.5x normal movement. (19) Buzzy Buzzy Bee - The buzzing caused by Queenie’s wings while she’s flying disrupts others thoughts, this prevents others from trying to interrupt her movement. (?) Queenie’s bee wings become stronger yet again allowing her to fly continuously for who knows how long now and overseas (if she wasn’t afraid of water). This doubles her movement, again, she can now also move-act-move. Her flight capabilities may not be impeded in any way."
passive,Queenie,Pollen Connection,,,"All of Queenie’s bees are connected to her via a barely visible pollen chain she can use this chain to send/receive things with the bees, additionally she can redirect damage from her to the bees and vice/versa. Enemies passing through the chains have a chance for their allergies to act up causing them to start sneezing uncontrollably, their next roll is a minus depending on severity of allergies. (71) Having any bees out and abuzz causes flowers to instantly grow and flourish wherever they are regardless of environment, once per round on her turn Queenie can declare a type of plant or flower and that kind will almost certainly be there. Rarer or fantasy-like plants have a lower chance of being there but there will *always* be flowers there. In addition, Queenie gains sovereignty over almost all bees. If there are bees she is not in control of, she can roll with advantage to make a connection to them and potentially control them."
passive,Queenie,Combo Queen,,,Whenever an enemy is hit and sent into a Bee or Queenie herself they may make a follow up attack with additional knockback sending them flying in a direction of their choice. Queenie may use any of her unused movement to add to the knockback of herself or her bees. This can only occur once per round per Bee and once per turn for Queenie herself.
ability,Queenie,Summon Bee,2,2,"2 Bees are summoned to protect their queen. Queenie can direct them as she sees fit. Once per combat she can get prof from a bee nat20. 6 move - 5 Stam - 3 Dam Explode on death 3 damage to enemies and restore 1 stamina to allies within 2 spaces Max Limit - 4 31. Summon Bee now has a max limit of 6 bees at once and higher rolls may allow her to summon 3 bees at a time. (26) Chef Bee (0) - Queenie can now summon a Bee in a little chefs hat once per combat. It cannot attack, has Queenie’s movement, can bake honey cookies that heal for 3 and can be passed out. She starts with one at the start of combat (does not count as the once per combat summon). If it dies it explodes healing allies for 2 within 3 spaces. “Honey Pot” Aura is 4. 8 Stamina. Whenever Summon Bee is used successfully Queenie can change the composition of the bees that are summoned allowing her to give the bees jobs to do, some may cost additional stamina to summon. This also increases the amount of bees she can summon with this ability to 8. Can summon up to 4 bees on high rolls. If she just summons regular bees this is a bonus action. - Bee Larvae (-1) - 0 Movement, 0 Damage and 2 stamina. 10ft Healing aura that heals allies for 2 stamina at the start of their turns. After 1 round they become a Bee of Queenie’s choice. Can be summoned within 2 spaces of Queenie. - Regular Bee - 6 movement, 1 range, 3 damage and 5 stamina. They explode on death 3 damage to enemies and restore 1 stamina to allies within 2 spaces - Worker Bee - 7 movement, 1 range, 1 damage basic attack and 2 stamina. Can be used to create structures and objects out of wax. These structures are surprisingly sturdy. Whenever multiple Worker Bees work on the same thing they all roll for it and the highest roll is taken. Explode on death healing adjacent allies for 2 stamina. - Soldier Bee (2) - The Royal Guard of bees. Only 3 can be out at a time. 4 Movement, a 1 range, 5 damage basic attack, 7 stamina. Explode for 3 damage to enemies within 2 spaces when they die. - Sniper Bee (1) - A bee with a gun. 5 Movement, a 6 range 3 damage basic attack, 3 stamina. Cannot give knockback to their attacks but can benefit from attacks knocked into their range. Fires a single shot that must be rolled for, when they die at a target of their choice in range and if that shot hits the target takes 1 damage and a -2 to all of their rolls until the end of their next turn. Even on a Nat1 this shot cannot hit allies. - Helper Bee (1) - A bee that just wants to help. 8 movement and no basic attack, 3 stamina. Can choose to assist an ally and give them a +1 to all their rolls for that round for every bee that helps them. Explode for 3 stamina healing to adjacent allies upon death. Once per turn can self detonate to give an ally a reroll, but cannot heal anyone if they do this. - Kamikazbee (1) - A bee that just wants to explode! It has 10 movement, 1 stamina. And explodes as an action or when it dies, this deals 5 damage to all enemies in a 4 space area centred on it and heals all allies for 3 stamina in a 5 space area. - Custom Bee (X) A Queenie Original. All factors are determined by the pieces that make it and Queenie can use the general environment, honey or even other bee capabilities to create it. Stamina cost depends on what is made. She may use a normal bee as a base and add effects onto it in this way as well. Queenie can add any bee made through this to her list permanently but must pay 1 max stamina per one, the cost to summon them is the cost originally given -1 to a minimum of 1."
ability,Queenie,Honey Pot,2!,,"Honey is delicious and everyone knows it, Queenie and her bees smell like honey. Enemies in range must focus her or the bees. Queenie range is 5. Bees range is 3. Once per round."
ability,Queenie,Tasty,1,,Eat honey to gain 3 stamina can be used on adjacent allies. Eating the honey can grant a movement OR damage buff of 1 but may be improved or impaired depending on roll. (36) Tasty can now heal for 4 and provides either a buff of +1 damage and movement or +2 to either damage or movement. Additionally it is a free action if used on an ally.
ability,Queenie,Honeymancer,1!,,"Only the Queen Bee, master of the entire hive could control the honey, but when the bees needed her most...she was right there. Queenie can now “Honey-bend” creating, controlling and forming honey into whatever form she wishes. Different flowers, pollen or other factors may result in different “flavours” of honey. Honeymancer is now an anytime."
ability,Queenie,Honey & Clover,2,,Queenie smacks someone with her Honey Twirler into the air before following up with a swarm of bees attacking them and launching in a direction of her choice with extra knockback that makes it easier for her bees or teammates to combo off of. (If she already has bees summoned this is easier to pull off as she can direct as many bees as she wishes to perform the follow up attack).
ability,Queenie,Dracobee,5⛯,,"Once per combat Queenie pours an ungodly amount of wax and honey into a single entity, a giant 5x5 dragon. The dragon has 25 stamina, 6 movement and can fly. It also has a honey breath attack that deals 6 damage in a 10 range cone that heals allies it hits for half of the damage dealt. Every 5 stamina it loses chips it away lowering it’s max stamina down to a multiple of 5 but it shaves off a portion of itself creating a 1x1 dracobeeling that has 5 stamina, 8 movement, full flight and a 2 damage 8 range cone that heals allies for the amount of damage it deals. When the dracobeelings die they explode dealing 2 damage to enemies within 2 spaces of it and healing allies for 2. When the dragon dies it detonates into a huge explosion dealing 5 damage to all enemies in the arena and heals all non-summon allies and Queenie herself for 5 stamina. Queenie can sacrifice already summoned bees to add a +2 to her roll to summon the dragon for each bee sacrificed, this can get her out of a Nat 1 fail but not give her a Nat 20. For all intensive purposes these dragons count as bees. Due to the exhaustion from doing this Queenie can not summon any of her bees for the next 2 rounds."
weapon,Utah,Australian Boomerang,,,"A strong boomerang that deals 3 damage at 6 range. If the roll misses, you can roll again to see if it hits on the way back for 1 damage."
talent,Utah,Emu Assassin,,,"Your time in the Great Emu War has made you great at assassinating targets… that move right next to you. Whenever an enemy ends their movement adjacent to you, you can perform a melee attack with a machete for 4 damage."
passive,Utah,Infrastructure In The Outback,,,"Once per round, you may boost a roll by the number of buildings you have built."
ability,Utah,Sydney Opera House,3,,Create a 2x2 Sydney Opera House. Then created roll a dice on this table to determine what Anime Campaign song it starts playing. It now grants an effect roughly based off of the rolled song. If you are adjacent to it you can spend a once per round bonus action to reroll the song being played. Has 10 stamina. Can’t have more than one on the field at once. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FOeWWbEALN2WGoO2eZpnyHJJ7bqUDWKi2bBaq0JeKOY/edit?usp=sharing 
ability,Utah,Hyde Park,2,,Create a 2x2 Hyde Park. Enemies that enter it take 3 damage from the murderous Australian wildlife and allies can harvest some of the killer wildlife to deal +1 damage from all their attacks (doesn't stack). Has 6 stamina.
ability,Utah,Australian Cartography,2!,,Cause anything to flip upside down and have it’s gravity reversed for a round.
weapon,Ryla,Epithet Staff,,,While she claims it's a staff it's really a large red stick with an epithet that allows it to manipulate electricity. Discharge deals 4 damage with 3 range 
talent,Ryla,My Mind Is An Enigma,,,Any and all psychological and mental effects don’t affect her. Instead causing wild magic (I.E. 3 emotional damage = 3 wild magic effects)
passive,Ryla,I Can Bullshit It,,,The scrutiny of logic does not apply as much to her and technicalities are more pronounced
ability,Ryla,Welp. That Happened.,3,,"She can Joseph Joestar any insane plot, rube goldberg, or series of events into happening as long as she can come up with at least a tenuous logical link between them."
ability,Ryla,A Surprise Tool That Will Help Us Later,2,,"She can pull out any seemingly irrelevant small object, this does not use up an action"
ability,Ryla,There's Two Of Them!?,Half your current stamina rounded down,,She removes her eyepatch causing her secondary personality to split off into a separate person who acts like a second player. Once per combat.
weapon,Alexis,Nug,,,"Honestly it's just a crappy gun held upside down deals 5 damage at melee range (its being held upside down {the pinky is on the trigger} but his her its hand is also twisted to be upside down, so it's ultimately upright), but for some reason if the target has an immunity/resistance to a certain affect, some form of that affect is immediately applied and the resistance/immunity is ignored."
talent,Alexis,The Weak Dominate The Strong,,,"As his/her/its objective is ultimately to invert all of reality he/she/it wants the weak to rule over the strong, making the weakest team/person (determined by GM’s discretion) roll with advantage and the strongest team/person roll with disadvantage (even if his/her/its team is winning) (inverse rolls invert the effect to match what the GM intends.)"
passive,Alexis,Go On And Do Your Worst,,,All their roles are inverted (1 is a critical 20 is a critical failure low rolls succede and high rolls fail etc… or vice versa) and this ability will also be given to one opponent or ally as well at the start of combat.
ability,Alexis,Your Ability Sucks,3,,"Here's a better one, Alexis inverts the overall theme of one target ability/talent/passive/weapon/object until end of combat making them adapt it and its effects to the new theme as if they had a different epithet. However once per combat, completely invert the overall theme of one target character tell the end of combat. Forcing them to adapt their epithet/core word, talent, passive, weapon, abilities etc.. to the new theme. Using this version however costs 5 stamina and forces him/her/it to skip a turn, or uses all of his/hers/its remaining stamina"
ability,Alexis,erutaN fO swaL ehT,3,,"Alexis does not care about your rules or anyone else for that matter, they play by their own rules… and makes everyone else does so as well. As such he/she/it can make something impossible possible or something possible impossible. This change applies to everyone. Only one can be in affect at a time."
ability,Alexis,No u,3!,,Reverse the direction of something… ANYTHING. (once per round)
weapon,Prætrix,Phantom Echo,,,"A crystalline dueling sword with a pale blue glow that can be summoned and desummoned at will, it's technically a projection akin to her ghost half, unlike her ghost half it is fully physical. As it is connected to her soul if she strikes precisely enough (roll of 18 or higher) she heals 1 stamina, deals 5 damage at 1 range."
talent,Prætrix,Ghastlete,,,Being a phantom thief Prætrix is quite agile and can perform stupidly athletic tasks with ease allowing her do things like run across tightropes (or other thin objects) and jump on to and from stable spires with ease (many stupidly athletic actions become possible and she rolls with advantage when performing them). Simpler acrobatic feats such as jumping or maintaining balance no longer require a roll (within reason of course). As she is after all a thief her movement is silent as well.
passive,Prætrix,External Soul,,,"Prætrix’s soul is for some reason separate from her actual body, consequently she has effecily 2 bodies that are linked (shared stamina, sensory links etc). As the ghost half is not fully physical it can pass through solid objects that don’t have souls themselves however as a result from this her ghost half must roll to interact with the physical world around her before she can affect anything (I.E touch or attack) this does not apply when using an ability through the ghost half (this roll can not critically succeed or fail), Other can do the same to interact with her ghost half as well (although unlike her this applies abilities as well) the ghost half is also capable of flight. She can directly interact with any ghost or ghost like entity."
ability,Prætrix,Steal Your Soul,3,,"Possess a soulless object gaining full control of the object and giving that object the ability to fly damaging the object does not damage Prætrix. (Upkeep cost of 1 stamina per turn of possession), However once per combat she can force the soul out of something that has a soul (or the programing of a complex machine) and gain full control of them. Causing their soul to become a ghost and giving them the ability to possess something as well. While in this state they can pass through walls and fly but can't directly interact with anything without rolling to be able to interact first, they also have a free activation of this ability and can possess a soulless object [I.E. Prætrix’s body] or force the soul out of something as well) The upkeep cost does not apply outside of combat. (Note abilities other than flight can not be used when possessing a non PC or NPC) Your self-possession has been upgraded! While self-possessing Prætrix has double movement speed in addition to the flight that happens from all possessions, and your attacks all deal +1 damage! However, self-possession is a desperation move and cases Prætrix to drain stamina rapidly. Instead of taking a 1 stamina upkeep cost, she takes an upkeep cost of half of her missing stamina minus 3 to a minimum of 1."
ability,Prætrix,Absent Apparition,2!,,Immediately teleport to the ghost half (and occupy the same tile) causing her to no longer be a valid target (if targeted by someone/something) provided she is no longer in range (they can retarget) (Once per round)
ability,Prætrix,Paranormal Whims,X,,Telekinetically lift up and/or manipulate something/someone that is within a 5 tile radius of Prætrix. The cost depends on what it was used on and what was done with it.
ability,Prætrix,Dueling Geist,1!,,Prætrix quickly summons Phantom Echo to parry an incoming attack targeting her.
weapon,Alexander,Knitting Needles,,,"Alexander’s trusty knitting needles! Can deal 5 damage to a single adjacent target, or 2 damage to 2 adjacent targets. 27: Professional Grade Needles - Alexander got a new pair of knitting needles! He can now target a single enemy up to 2 spaces away."
talent,Alexander,Fluffthoughts,,,Debuffs have disadvantage.
talent,Alexander,Tripping Over Myself,,,"Once per combat, when Alexander crit fails an attack, he can take an enemy down with him, making them also suffer the consequences of the crit fail."
passive,Alexander,Bundle of Warmth,,,Alexander radiates an aura of warm and fluffy feelings! This soft energy helps to ease unruly epithets. His aura is 15 feet wide and when allies are within it their abilities cost is reduced by 1.
ability,Alexander,Coffee Shop ASMR To Sleep Too | No Voice Triggers,3,,"Alexander pours boiling coffee on the target. This deals 5 damage immediately, and the target will receive 3 additional damage if they do not find a way to remove the hot coffee before Alexander’s next turn.  "
ability,Alexander,Comes in Tangles,3,,"With all the grace of a grandmother making Christmas presents,Alexander weaves his yarn around the target, trapping them in what can only be described as a modern day Gordian Knot. The target has disadvantage to any ability that requires the use of their limbs, and has halved movement. At the end of the target’s turn they can roll to try to escape the knot."
ability,Alexander,Pocket Chocolate,2,,"Alexander always keeps hard candy on him! Adjacent teammates can eat the candy to restore 4 stamina, or Alexander can throw it to a space up to 2 spaces away, drawing enemy summons to it, distracting them for 1 round. 21: Chocolate Delivery - “Pocket Chocolate” can now be used on allies up to 3 spaces away."
ability,Alexander,Soften the Blow!,1!,,"Uh oh! That looks like it’ll hurt! Once per round, Alexander can reach out and coat an ally in fluff, reducing the damage received from an attack."
ability,Alexander,Wrapping Up,2!,,"You gotta get out of there! Seeing a distant ally in danger, Alexander can tie his yarn into a lasso and pull them out of the way! Once per round."
ability,Alexander,Extra Squishy,3,,"Focusing on happy thoughts, Alexander meditates and his aura grows stronger! As a movement action, Alexander can expand his aura to 25 feet and costs in the area are now reduced to 2. He can keep the aura up on subsequent turns without needing to roll, but must take cost again and can not make a movement action."
weapon,Bynthia,"""Magic Wand""",,,"Bynthia’s sharpened steel broadsword.  Deals 5 melee damage.  If she attacks on her turn and doesn’t move, she also enters a defensive stance - all attack rolls made against her until the start of her next turn have a -3 penalty."
talent,Bynthia,"""Shield of Faith""",,,"When an adjacent ally is attacked, Bynthia can knock them over, splitting the damage between herself and the ally (each of them take a minimum of 1 damage, and if it is an odd number, Bynthia takes the extra damage). 2: Shield Of Faither - Bynthia can now use ‘Shield of Faith’ on allies up to 2 spaces away, and the damage dealt to her ally will always be reduced somewhat even on low rolls."
passive,Bynthia,My Ultimate Foe...,,,"Bynthia is insane, and is convinced that she has a dark backstory involving an elusive arch-nemesis who she’s spent all of her life trying to track down.  At the start of her first turn in combat, each enemy must make a roll.  The one who rolls the lowest becomes Bynthia’s nemesis, which means that something Bynthia does during her turn must involve attacking them in some way.  She can still deal damage to other targets, but actions she takes must at least indirectly get her closer to defeating her ultimate foe.  She has +1 to all rolls made to attack her nemesis and all damage dealt to them is increased by 1. The target remains her nemesis until they are defeated, at which point Bynthia must immediately choose the first enemy she sees as her next nemesis.  Whenever she chooses a new nemesis, she can narrate some edgy backstory about how they ruined her life, and the bonus to rolls (not the damage) she gets to defeat them increases the funnier or more ludicrous the backstory is.  Once per combat, she can use a bonus action on her turn to change which enemy her nemesis is to another of her choice, but she must spend 3 Stamina to do so."
ability,Bynthia,"""Deep Slumber""",2,,"Bynthia calls upon the eldritch majjyickkz of the beyond to lull a target within 4 spaces into a deep trance.... Well, actually she grabs them around the neck and puts them in a chokehold. This deals 4 damage and restrains targets, debuffing their rolls and preventing them from moving very far until they manage to escape. If they do not manage to escape the chokehold before Bynthia’s next turn, the target takes an additional 4 damage. 5: Call Of The Abyss - ‘Deep Slumber’ now deals its damage again if the enemy has not managed to escape the chokehold before Bynthia’s next turn."
ability,Bynthia,"""Blink""",1!,,Bynthia travels through the ethereal plane to evade an incoming attack (Bynthia unceremoniously walks behind the enemy and stabs them in the back). This deals her basic attack damage and can interrupt attacks on high rolls.
ability,Bynthia,"""Lightning Strike""",2,,"Bythia calls upon the powers of the lighting gods to strike down all enemies in her path! (Bynthia Naruto runs to a space 5 spaces away, dealing 4 damage to the enemies in her path as she flails her “Wand” around wildly).  If she ends this ability adjacent to an enemy who did not take damage from it, she can make a free basic attack against them."
ability,Bynthia,"""Gravity Wave""",3,,"Bynthia leaps into a cluster of nearby enemies and calls upon her power to alter the flow of gravity, sending them sprawling to the ground. She leaps to a space within 5 spaces of her, and all enemies within 2 spaces of her take 5 damage as she rapidly slices, trips, and jujitsus them to the ground. The enemies will have reduced movement during their next turn."
weapon,Cepheus,Lockpick,,,"4 Damage, 1 Range. More effective at unlocking doors, but it can work in a pinch!  On a roll of 15+, he can steal something he has seen the target use as per his passive, and can apply the stolen aspect to himself or an ally immediately.  If he does so, it does not count towards one of his three slots. 24: When rolling the 15+ effect of Lockpick, Cepheus may pay the cost +2 (including if there is no initial cost) to charge it up slightly and increase the power and effectiveness of the stolen aspect 1.5x. Whether he uses it or not, it retains that boost until it is returned."
talent,Cepheus,For Me?,,,"Once per session, Cepheus can take a teammate’s combat rewards for himself. In exchange, the teammate receives one prof granting nat 20 to be used as they see fit and which carries over between sessions.  If he uses this in a data bounty, only half the reward is stolen (rounded up)."
talent,Cepheus,Rat Boy Stinkman,,,"Cepheus certainly is. But y’know what, that’s fine. Once on his turn while moving past someone he may pay 1 stamina and steal either 1 movement or 1 basic attack damage from them, this does not require a roll. This has its own separate Steal Slot but he only has a single one and gaining something new does mean replacing an older one and other things stolen may not be put in them. Unfortunately this stops at the end of a session returning the things stolen back to their owners as Cepheus inevitably steals this from others on his way back home or something."
passive,Cepheus,Everything You Have Is Mine To Take,,,"Once per round, as an unrolled anytime action, Cepheus can steal all or part of an ability, passive, or talent that he has seen during this combat.  While it is in his possession, it cannot be used by the target he stole from.  The only reliable way for them to get it back is probably by bribing him.  He has three slots which he can store these stolen aspects in.  As a bonus action on his turn, he can apply one of these stolen aspects to himself or an ally of his choice.  He can not steal ALL of something from a target unless their proficiency is lower than his.  When he steals part of something, he can take one complete sentence from its description, altering it accordingly.  Stealing something costs between 1-3 Stamina, GMs choice, depending on its value.  If he applies a stolen aspect to himself, it is there for the next 2 rounds, after which point it is returned to the original owner.  It is also returned to the original owner if he replaces it in his 3 slots.  There is no limit to how long he can keep something he steals, and it does not return to the original user even if he dies.  He must willingly give it back."
ability,Cepheus,Silent Sabotage,2!,,"Cepheus waves his hand and snatches an effect out of the air and warps its true purpose.  This effect must be a numerical value, and can be anything from damage, healing, a roll buff, or what have you.  The value itself remains constant, but the purpose of it is changed to whatever he wants and applied to whatever target he wishes.  Once per round. 19 - Stolen Commission - When warping the intended purpose of a numerical value Cepheus may temporarily store up to 2 of that number on their person to be able to apply to something else in the same way as a separate once per round anytime effect."
ability,Cepheus,More Than You Bargained For,3⛯,,"With a devilish smirk, Cepheus targets someone within 3 spaces of him and takes an aspect of their fighting style for himself.  This can take the form of a buff or red stat the character has.  Whatever he takes is at around halved effectiveness on himself and does not last for its usual duration.  Even if he does not meet the usual requirements for whatever red stat he steals - whether its hunger, rage, bullets, or blood - he can use it in the same manner his victim can.  If he takes red stat, it is reduced for the target by the same amount he gains.  If he takes a buff, then particularly powerful or very necessary buffs might stay on the target but only be reduced in duration or potency.  Otherwise, he simply steals them entirely.  Once per combat per target."
ability,Cepheus,A Vision Stolen From View,1!,,"Cepheus suddenly steals all existence around himself to effectively render himself invisible and intangible for a brief moment.  If this would enable him to dodge something fully, he can choose to instead allow it to be a minor success on himself, which allows him to absorb one of the properties of the attack.  This does not render the user unable to use it further, but it does allow him to apply that property to one of his future actions during this combat.  This does not take up a passive slot.  When Cepheus reappears, he can do so up to 5 spaces away from his original position.  Once per round."
ability,Cepheus,Better Me Than You,3,,"As a bonus action, Cepheus uses an ability that he has stolen and then applied to himself.  The roll for this ability counts as the roll for that one."
ability,Cepheus,Heartstealer,5⛯,,"Cepheus sticks out his grubby little mitts and a unit of his choice up to 4 spaces away has their heart stolen from them be it literal or conceptual. This not only deals a hefty 10-16 damage to that target but also allows him to, as a free action on his turn, squeeze it to attempt to do 4-6 damage to that target. Of course there’s other benefits to this, the target of this may not directly target Cepheus and in fact Cepheus can use his own main and move action to order the target to take a full turn with actions of his choice (this cannot use their once per combats or higher level abilities, actions or effects). This is not considered mental manipulation of any kind. There are also drawbacks to this, if Cepheus takes 10 or more damage in a single round he must give up the heart and also Cepheus may only use two of his Steal Slots total during this time. He may give up the heart as a no cost anytime action to force all damage and negative effects dealt to him in the round to instead affect the original target (though halved rounding up), Cepheus may not and can not give up the heart during his first round of owning it. If Cepheus is knocked out it returns to the original owner. Once Per Combat."
weapon,Chat Ghost,Ecto-Blast,,,"Chat Ghost fires a blast of bright pink ghost magic at a foe within 5 spaces of her, dealing 4 damage to them on a successful hit and healing Chat Ghost for 2 Stamina. If she rolls a 14+ with this attack, Chat Ghost can automatically attach to them in the same manner as though she had used ‘Trolling From The Afterlife’ on them. However, if she chooses to do this, she cannot use Ecto-Blast on that enemy for the rest of combat, because covering people in her ghost slime too many times in a row seems to make people horny for some reason."
talent,Chat Ghost,Socializing is Draining,,,"At the start of Chat Ghost’s turn, she can transfer up to 7 points of her own stamina to her allies. This HP can be given to a single ally or divided up between multiple allies. 6 prof - Chat Ghost can now transfer up to 10 Stamina to her allies with ‘Socializing is Draining’, and she only actually loses an amount of Stamina equal to half the amount she transfers (rounded up)."
passive,Chat Ghost,Let Me In!,,,"Chat Ghost is not bound by this mortal plane! Obstacles, both inanimate and living, can not block or bind her, but she can not bring objects or teammates with her through these barriers. If Chat Ghost is blocked by an obstacle or someone succeeds at binding her, she can pass through them, but she loses all buffs she previously possessed. This does not work with ghost-specific items, such as vacuums."
passive,Chat Ghost,Chat Ghost,,,"Chat Ghost can read whatever people say in the Roll20 chat, in canon."
passive,Chat Ghost,Light as a Feather,,,"Chat Ghost is dead, and as such finds it fairly easy to move around without a physical form to weigh her down.  She can now pay 1 Stamina on her turn to double move even if she’s already taken a main action.  If she does, then all the spaces she moves this turn are covered with a trail of ectoplasm that counts as difficult terrain for her enemies, and if walked on deals 1 damage to enemies.  She can now also passively hover up to 10 feet in the air."
ability,Chat Ghost,I'll Pass,0,,"Chat Ghost can’t be bothered to fight right now. She passes her turn to an ally, allowing them to fight in her place (and/or get out of danger). On crits she can still use her movement.  If she spends 1 Stamina on this ability, the first roll the ally makes during their turn has a +3 bonus. 8: You’ve Got This, Bud - Chat Ghost can now always still use her movement when she uses ‘I’ll Pass’."
ability,Chat Ghost,It’s Dangerous to Go Alone ,2,,"Sometimes it’s better not to go solo. Chat Ghost can pair up with a teammate FE:Awakening style, moving her wherever her partner goes and giving them advantage on one of their actions. 15:  Take This - While Chat Ghost is attached to an ally via ‘It’s Dangerous To Go Alone’, every time that ally takes a main or bonus action, Chat Ghost can dual-tech with them in some manner with an action of her own.  It costs 2 extra Stamina each time she does this, though, even for using a basic attack that doesn’t normally cost Stamina.  After three such actions are made, Chat Ghost must pay the cost of the ability again to continue staying attached."
ability,Chat Ghost,Trolling From the Afterlife,3,,"Chat Ghost doesn’t just haunt her allies. Chat attaches herself to an enemy within 5 spaces, possessing them for the next round. The target has disadvantage to attacking Chat’s allies unless they can find a way to remove her. If Chat is still attached at the end of the round she can roll again to continue possessing them with either advantage OR a reduced stamina cost of 2 (must be stated before rolling or it defaults to reduced cost)."
ability,Chat Ghost,"Ghost in the Chat, What Sins Will She Commit",2!,,"Chat Ghost sees it every time you post cringe.  Thankfully, she’s based enough to take what you’re saying and spin it into something better.  Using this ability, Chat Ghost takes something that has been posted in the roll20 chat since the end of her previous turn and manifests it in her reality.  She can twist people’s words and sentences however she wishes when she does this to create a limitless variety of objects and effects.  However, whatever she manifests must be limited to a single sentence that’s ten words or less, and anything people are posting to intentionally try to help her in obvious, impractical, and stupid ways (such as typing “a nuke that kills the boss instantly”) can have their effectiveness and definition twisted by the GM just as much as she can.  In addition, if she manifests something that was said by one of her allied party members or their player, then the relevant ally must also spend 2 Stamina in addition to the cost she pays."
weapon,Kitty,Flail,,,"She just has a real ass flail. Deals 6 damage to 1 target up to 2 spaces away. 32: Malware Detected - If a target within 2 spaces of Kitty makes an attack on an ally, she can make a free ‘Flail’ attack against that enemy. 40: Choose One: Kitty’s Flail deals +1 damage, or gains 1 range (3 total)."
talent,Kitty,Norted VPN,,,"Most cats are liquid, but this one is code!! Once per combat Kitty can avoid an attack by hopping into the nearest device connected to the internet and popping out of a different one farther away.  Her roll to do this has a +3 bonus. 51: Digital Zone - When combat begins, every target present, including summons, gains a stack of Digistatic. In addition, Norted VPN can now be used twice per combat. 60 Prof - ‘Norted VPN’ and ‘SAO But Better’ no longer require a phone or other device to be nearby in order for her to use them. 60 Prof - ‘Norted VPN’ and ‘SAO But Better’ no longer require a phone or other device to be nearby in order for her to use them."
talent,Kitty,Google Translate,,,"Kitty can now translate any text, no matter how strange or inscrutable, into whatever language she wants."
talent,Kitty,Efficient Teamwork,,,"Twice per combat, Kitty can use her movement to instead allow an ally to move up to their usual movement. If this movement would normally provoke any kind of trap, hazard, or attack of opportunity-esque effect, it does not. Restraining effects still apply."
talent,Kitty,What A Digital Dummy,,,"Once per turn, as a free action, Kitty can spend 1 Stamina to apply the prefix “Digi” to an object of her choice."
talent,Kitty,Bluescreen,,,"Kitty now knows the truth about the little girl named Michelle Robinson. And now that she does, continuing to maintain the facade of possessing a human soul would be far too much effort. Kitty is now immune to mental, emotional, and fear effects."
passive,Kitty,SAO but Better,,,"Kitty can enter any device connected to the internet, but she tends to get sidetracked by viruses and hackers. During her turn, she can enter somebody’s computer, phone, 3ds, etc. up to 3 spaces away. This removes her from the combat until the start of her next turn. She can alter information or data on their device if she makes a roll, which can have a variety of effects. When returning to combat she appears next to the person whose device she entered. 21: SAO But Better But Better - Kitty can now enter devices up to 6 spaces away, and now rolls with advantage when she messes with them. 60 Prof - ‘Norted VPN’ and ‘SAO But Better’ no longer require a phone or other device to be nearby in order for her to use them."
passive,Kitty,System Purrge,,,"Kitty never quits a job before it’s finished, and she’s the best virus hunter there is. Each time Kitty affects someone with an attack or ability, whether it’s offensive or supportive in nature, that target is marked with a stack of ‘Digistatic’. The target is marked even if the attack or ability fails, it simply has to be used on them. While a target is marked with Digistatic, any rolls Kitty makes to learn something about the target have a bonus equal to double their Digistatic. Digistatic persists until the end of combat and cannot be removed by most means. Once per combat, Kitty can use a bonus action to activate the Digistatic, causing neon pink lightning to flare around every marked target and blast outwards from them. The marked targets themselves take 2 damage per stack, unless they are allies. The lightning also shocks a number of spaces around them equal to the number of stacks (1 stack = every space adjacent to them, 2 stacks = everywhere within 2 spaces of them, ect.). Anyone caught in this blast that Kitty considers an enemy takes an additional 2 damage per stack. The damage can overlap. 51: Digital Zone - When combat begins, every target present, including summons, gains a stack of Digistatic. In addition, Norted VPN can now be used twice per combat."
passive,Kitty,Technology Transcendent,,,"Kitty’s epithet becomes fully entangled with her true nature as a spirit. There is no longer any difference between the real world and the digital world for her. ‘Norted VPN’ and ‘SAO But Better’ no longer require a phone or other device to be nearby in order for her to use them. In addition, when Kitty moves, she can spend 3 Stamina to instead teleport up to 10 spaces away as a movement action, suffusing her being with the world around her for an instant. While out of combat, Kitty can also now enter the DBAtabase at any time, no device required, and those in the DBAtabase can communicate with her freely simply by addressing her while they speak."
ability,Kitty,I'm In!,2,,"Kitty transforms into a stream of electrons and zips forward up to 5 spaces, before reemerging and attacking all enemies within 2 spaces of her with a mighty twist of her flail. Each enemy takes 4 damage and might be knocked over on high rolls. 38: Run Diagnostic - If any allies are hit with ‘I’m In!’ they have a +3 bonus to their next non-damaging roll. ‘I’m In!’ now hits all targets within 4 spaces of Kitty."
ability,Kitty,This Seems Buggy,1!,,"Kitty is here to solve all of your weird tech issues! When a teammate’s really good idea fails, Kitty can turn digital and try to debug their move, giving it a large bonus. She can also do this to cleanse certain kinds of debuffs.  Once per round. 23: One Woman I.T. Department - Once per combat, ‘This Seems Buggy’ can be used twice in the same round. In addition, Kitty has a large bonus when she uses this on robotic or digital beings, and once per session, a high roll with this ability can allow a robotic or digital being to gain permanent buffs or attributes."
ability,Kitty,Chain Mail,3⛯,,"Quick!! Share this message with 3 other friends in the next 2 minutes and you will receive +6 Stamina!!1! If you don’t you will get 1 round of bad luck!1! (Once per combat. Yes. You need to copy and paste the unparanthesed text of this ability to 3 friends on discord and give screenshots to prove it. If the friend responds to you, you have to share that too.) 54: Copypasta - If Kitty and her allies send the ‘Chainmail’ message to six friends instead of just three, they will heal for 10 Stamina instead. I’m so sorry."
ability,Kitty,Keysmash,2!,,"Pulling a keyboard from nowhere, Kitty rapidly smashes the keys and hacks into someone’s attack, causing it to become jumbled and unpredictable. If she uses this on an enemy attack, it will have a debuff to its roll, and the attack or ability being used will now be interpreted by the GM in the most strange and chaotic way possible. The same effect applies to an ally’s attack, but their roll doesn’t get penalized. Once per round. 44:  So Anyway I Just Started Smashing - ‘Keysmash’ is no longer once per round, but costs 2 additional Stamina each time it’s used in the same round, and gets weaker with repeated use.  In addition, high rolls with this ability now allow her to interpret and alter the ability however she likes, rather than it just getting more chaotic in general."
ability,Kitty,Refresh Page,3!⛯,,"It fixes the problem every time, you guys. Kitty can choose an ally and ‘reload’ them, causing them to glitch out of existence for a nanosecond before returning. They are cleansed of all debuffs, regain the amount of Stamina they spent on the last ability they used, and they can immediately take a full turn. Once per combat."
ability,Kitty,Hunter’s Arsenal,3,,"A professional virus hunter always keeps their arsenal of equipment at the ready, and using her epithet, Kitty has now figured out how to manifest it in the real world. Using this ability, Kitty can manifest a weapon, vehicle, or other piece of equipment of her choice that perfectly matches her aesthetic. The GM will decide the stats of the equipment, but it will generally match Kitty’s description of it. This ability is a bonus action, but only if she uses her main action to utilize the summoned equipment in some way. 69: Geek Squad’s Gonna… Gonna Go GREEK Squad On… On Your Ass…! -  Brainfuck sweats feverishly before crashing her cybertruck headlong into a concrete wall and disintegrating in the resulting fireball - ‘Hunter’s Arsenal’ is now always a bonus action, and once per combat, rather than equipping herself with whatever she summons, she can instead manifest one of the members of the Geek Squad to do so for her.  Examples include giving Python a laser cannon or allowing Brainfuck to drive a tank.  They act on Kitty’s turn and each have 15 Stamina along with their usual abilities."
weapon,Lotus,Sacrificial... Wand...,,,A strange looking metallic wand that Lotus has on their person. It can be stabbed into a target to deal 3 damage at 1 range and adds a free Pink to them. 18 - Weapon Upgrade - Sacrificial….Wand... - It now deals an additional 1 damage and adds an extra Pink.
weapon,Lotus,Magical Moon Stick,,,"It’s a gun. Tell your friends. Deals 4 damage at 7 range and can be used to threaten your friends (as a bonus action) with advantage. 25 - My Friends Will Help (Forcefully) - Lotus may threaten their friends as a once per round anytime. This can be done to force a friend to take a small action against someone else, to block something or to push someone out of the way. Pink cannot be added to this action."
talent,Lotus,Magic Of The Mother,,,"By spending an extra stamina on their actions Lotus may add a simple extra effect of their choice to the action or even change the action type completely (for example turning the damage of their knife to healing instead), but this might have unintended consequences on certain things (e.g. making things scared of them, forcing them to become mentally unstable or reversing the effects of some of her abilities) and still doesn’t stop people from bleeding out when they forcefully transform someone or something. The Pink Is Cold (+2) - Lotus starts to regenerate 1 Pink at the start of their own turns. "
passive,Lotus,In the Name of Old Gods,,,"Lotus is a magical...girl? Well, something like that anyway and is always considered to be in their transformed state for the duration of any session they are in. They are also always covering their entire body with their magical outfit. Always looking to befriend the horrific monsters of the multiverse and dye them in their colour which, as might be apparent, is pink. They start combat with 20 red stat, this represents their Pink, with every action they do they can spend 1 stamina and up to 2 Pink to transfer it from themselves to the primary target of the action. No more than 20 Pink can be held at a time. Anyone or anything that has 5 or more Pink on them starts to more and more see Lotus as a friend and ally giving them a -2 to targeting them offensively and a +2 to assisting them in any way.  If a single unit has 10 or more Pink on them will start to feel the effects a lot more forcing them to deal 2 less damage to Lotus and a -2 to rolls targeting Lotus’s allies with 3 spaces of them. They are also considered Lotus’s friend. If a single unit has 15 or more Pink on them they will be more willing to listen to their requests and Lotus can attempt this once per round on their turn in addition anything they do that wouldn’t normally damage their normal allies, does.  If a single target is at 20 Pink their form starts to shift and change shape becoming a small pink creature of Lotus’s own choice and design, their stats are determined by the original target and they become a summon under Lotus’s control for the rest of the session, at the end of the session they may choose to keep one of their new friends permanently, releasing the rest out to live in nature as they should be. One kept creature can be summoned per combat but it does not need to be rolled for, any gained throughout the session however, stay out until the end. This effect may not work fully on PCs or certain bosses/other characters, if this is the case, having 20 Pink on them gives them disadvantage to targeting Lotus and a -5 to their allies within 3 spaces of them. The more pink Lotus gives out from their own body the more their own body becomes paler and paler till it becomes white."
ability,Lotus,Check it Again,2,,"They’re not friends anymore. Lotus can use this to detonate a single one of their friends causing them to explode (removing them from combat) and dealing 5 damage to enemies within 2 spaces of them and giving Lotus 1-3 Pink. If used on one of their permanent friends they don’t die but cannot be used for the rest of combat. If used on an enemy with 10 or more Pink they take 10 damage and also they cry. That’s what I thought you lil’ bitch! Lotus gets all of the Pink from that target back if used like that. 20 - Check It Again - Lotus may spin the metaphorical wheel. By spending an extra stamina they may roll a d8. On a 1-3 this increases the range by 1, on a 4-5 this increases the pink applied by 1, on a 6-7 the damage is increased by 1 and on an 8 all of the effects happen."
ability,Lotus,Transformation Sequence,5⛯,,"Just because Lotus is transformed at all times doesn’t mean others can’t be. Lotus stabs an adjacent ally in the stomach for 3 damage and forces them to transform into a magical girl for the rest of combat. This gives them a flat +3 to all of their rolls, 2 DR and a +2 to all of their damage. Unfortunately they are also starting to bleed out taking 2 damage on each of their turns and they start to gain 5 Pink on each of their turns. Once per combat. 27 - Bask In Power, Be Useful To Mother - Units transformed via Lotus’ “Transformation Sequence” roll 3 sets of 2 random words and gain magical girl powers based on one of the word pairings. This will be stronger if they use “Weird Words” instead of normal ones."
ability,Lotus,Unseen Eyes,1!,,"Lotus points their wand towards a target and an eye marker appears on their body. This eye cannot be removed under normal circumstances and Lotus’s wand is mysteriously drawn to it. In addition to this Lotus is able to know the exact location of anyone with a marker on them. Placing an eye is a bonus action and there can only be one out at a time. As a once per round anytime action Lotus can let go of their wand and it will zoom at great speeds directly to the eye marker, no matter the distance. When it has made contact it will deal 3 damage and can be used to interrupt actions, if the wand strikes into an ally with this ability their next ability will cost 2 stamina less (to a minimum of 0) and give them a +3 to their next roll (they do not take damage). When the eye marker is pierced by the wand it will disappear and the wand will return instantaneously to Lotus’s hand."
weapon,Omega,Scythe (Like the Emos Use),,,Omega uses this axe to get the job done (even though scythes are actually not a very efficient weapon but shhhhh). Deals 4 damage to up to two enemies in an adjacent 3x1 area.
talent,Omega,Your Special Eyes,,,Omega can not be blinded and her accuracy can not be reduced by any physical means.
passive,Omega,FIGHT ME YOU COWARD,,,"If Omega has not received damage for a round or more, her attacks gain advantage until someone finally gains the COURAGE to fight her."
ability,Omega,Blood Lust,1!,,"Once per round, after an ally within 5 spaces successfully attacks an enemy, Omega gets overwhelmed by the urge to finish them off. She rushes at the target, dealing her basic attack damage and landing on an adjacent tile. 14: Survival Instinct - ‘Bloodlust’ can now be used defensively. When an enemy attacks Omega with a melee attack, she can try to instantly slash her scythe towards them, reducing or negating the damage they deal to her and dealing her basic attack damage to them instead."
ability,Omega,BOMBastic,2⛯,,"Omega has a bomb! She can plant this bomb in any space adjacent to her (with the specific tile known only to her and the gm), and then moves away. After her turn ends, the bomb will activate when an enemy steps on it or on an adjacent tile, taking 5 damage, and the bomb deals 2 additional damage to anyone within 3 spaces of the explosion (including allies). Once per combat.  "
ability,Omega,Take the Shot,3,,"Nothing stands in the way of Omega hitting her target. Omega whips out her trusty laser gun and aims at an enemy up to 6 spaces away. The shot travels through any organic form, dealing 6 damage to the target and 2 damage to anyone who was standing in between them. "
weapon,Oz,Backpack (For Their Apple Sauce),,,"Oz’s backpack is full of applesauce! They can chuck a jar at an enemy up to 2 spaces away for 3 damage, or hand one to a teammate within range, who can open the jar as a movement action on their turn and eat the apple sauce, healing for 5 Stamina on average, but the longer they hold on to the apple sauce before eating it, the more it will heal, up to a maximum of 10 Stamina. 8: Ghapple Sauce - Azula and Adelaide have been helping Oz study up on magical concoctions. When Oz uses Backpack (for their apple sauce) on an ally, they can choose to have it be doubly effective from what it normally is, but when eaten, it will apply a Curse to them. 49:  Azula Took Oz To A Two Week Long Apple Mines Boot Camp - Oz’ ‘Backpack (for their applesauce)’ no longer has a range limit, and if they spend 3 Stamina when they use it, it is a bonus action."
weapon,Oz,Knives,,,"4 damage, 1 range. Oz has 13 of these. They basically have a collection going at this point. Received +1 purple knife (5 damage 1 range)"
talent,Oz,Years Beyond Containment,,,"Enemies have disadvantage when attempting to grapple Oz. 36: Tag World Champion - Upgrade for ‘Years Beyond Containment’. For being so young, Oz seems to be oddly experienced at maneuvering in combat. The first two attacks or effects in a given combat that target Oz specifically (AOE attacks are unaffected) have moderately reduced effectiveness if they succeed, usually doing only half damage and making debilitating effects last for a shorter time."
talent,Oz,I’ll Bide My Time,,,"If Oz fails their action on their turn, they can choose one of their allies. That ally has a +2 bonus to their rolls on their next turn. If one of those rolls involves supporting Oz in some way, it has advantage instead."
talent,Oz,Unphased And Unimpressed,,,"Oz is immune to psychic damage or fear effects of any kind. In addition, once per combat, Oz can choose to ignore a specific debuff or debilitating effect that they are under or about to be affected by, powering through it with gritted teeth and hate-filled eyes."
passive,Oz,Early Memories,,,"For only being ‘this many’ years old, Oz knows alot about world history, and their epithet allows them to repeat certain major events that have occured in the past in the present day!! At the beginning of each of Oz’s turns, they roll three years between 0-2020. Then, as a free anytime action during the next round, they can choose one of the major events that occurred during the rolled years (https://www.onthisday.com will be used for this) and bring them to life in some way. They can use this to enhance the attack they or an ally are doing, debilitate or distract an enemy, or just straight up summon the historical event into the arena temporarily. 57: More Like PISStory - Oz can now bring to life any historical event within 5 years of their passive’s history rolls. They also now roll five years instead of three."
passive,Oz,Wisdom of Millenia,,,"Whenever Oz makes a roll to know something, it rolls with advantage if it is not related to witches, witchcraft, or historical events. If it is related to these topics, they roll with triple advantage. If they use this to learn something about an enemy, it will give them bonuses to certain actions they make that exploit this knowledge in some way."
passive,Oz,One Thousand Lives Of Wicked Whimsy,,,"Oz has lived countless lives, and died countless tragic deaths. But thanks to their experiences they’ve had with their friends, they have learned to accept every part of themself, enough that they can conjure echoes of their previous lives even without the power of Grimm’s book. As an unrolled free action on their turn, Oz can spend 5 Stamina and roll 3d22 on a list of their past lives, choosing the result they like the most. An echo of that past life is then summoned to the battlefield under their control. This echo has 15 Stamina and 5 movement regardless of their usual statistics. Only one past life can be summoned at a time, and only twice per combat."
ability,Oz,Longing for Return,X,,"Become Baby! Epithetical chains wrap around a nearby target, draining away some of their life. This deals X damage (x is equal to the amount of stamina spent on the ability) and heals an ally for half the damage dealt (rounded up). Oz can spend a maximum of 10 Stamina on this ability at one time. (Because James is a forgetful baby, if he forgets to state how much stamina Oz is putting in before rolling, it defaults to 2.) 66:  My Pain Is Far Greater - The Stamina maximum that Oz can spend when using ‘Longing For Return’ is increased to 30, and they can now split the damage across up to three targets.  Only one ally can receive the healing, still."
ability,Oz,History Repeats Itself,2!,,"Oz can repeat something that just occurred, like a specific action or event. If the action was something like a damaging or healing ability, it will have slightly reduced effectiveness. Once per round. 20: Infinite Spite - When Oz uses ‘Again Again!’ to repeat a damaging or debilitating effect on someone that they REALLY don’t like, the repeated effect will be slightly stronger, instead of weaker."
ability,Oz,A Fraction of Countless Years ,3⛯,,"Once per combat, Oz focuses their magic and changes an opponent's age. The target rolls a d100, and that’s how old they are now! 14: Just A Number - Oz can now use ‘Age AU’ on allies as well as enemies. If they do, they can roll the d100 twice and pick the result they like the best. 40: Time Moves Nonetheless - When Oz rolls their 1d100 for ‘A Fraction Of Countless Years’, it now does not apply to the literal age of the person, but rather their relative maturity as compared to a human scale. For example, rolling a 10 or lower will make a character extremely child-like relative to their species, and rolling a 90 or higher will make that character old and frail relative to their species even if that character would normally live for millenia. If a character is a completely timeless or ageless being, they are still somewhat affected by this ability, but less so."
ability,Oz,Soul Chained in Purgatory,3!,,"Oz lashes out with epithetical chains that glow with violet and gold flames. They wrap around two targets of their choice, and Oz manipulates their very souls with their epithet and witch magic to transfer any effects that have just occurred to a target, such as damage, debuffs, or healing, from one target to the other. The effects are siphoned from the original target and applied to the second target instead. Once per round. 24: Karmic Imprisonment - The effects transferred from one target to another via ‘Cursed Chains’ have their effectiveness increased by roughly 50% when they apply to the second target, and in addition, if Oz pays 2 extra Stamina, the chains stay connected to the targets for another four turns, during which Oz can transfer whatever effects they want between each target as they happen. "
ability,Oz,Eternity's Crucible,5⛯,,"Once per combat, Oz can extend their hands, unleashing epithetical energy combined with their feelings, and time slowly grinds to a halt. It does not stop suddenly; everything grinds to a halt slowly over the next 6 actions that are performed. The people who took those 6 actions take 3 damage for each action taken as they feel their very souls being scraped against the friction of reality. The actions can be of any type, even moving. Then, after the sixth action is taken, Oz can do one of three things: Rewind any of those actions that just occurred and make them happen a second time, either with reduced effectiveness or on a separate target. Take a main action that cannot be countered. Move twice, and perform brief minor things as they do that can mildly alter the state of things once time unfreezes. 34: Lasts A Lifetime - Oz can now choose two of the three options when they use ‘Eternity’s Crucible' if they spend an additional 3 Stamina to do so."
ability,Oz,Can We Ever Meet Again?,5,,"Despite their young age, Oz sure seems to know a lot of people! Oz focuses their magic on a single point while recalling a person they’ve met in the past, and conjures them into the present moment. Oz can summon any relatively major figure from world history or DBA lore, though beings that are significantly stronger than them will require either very high rolls to summon, not stick around for a long time, or not be very cooperative while they’re there. Oz can also keep a list of named characters they’ve met before in sessions and summon them as well. They can’t summon player characters unless they’ve met them. Oz can give whoever they summon basic orders, but they’ll still act how they usually would for the most part, and they will only last for 2 rounds at most. If the person is defeated, they simply fade back to wherever they were before. They can’t summon a character if their creator/controller is not available to play them at the time. This ability can be used on dead characters (though it might piss off certain Demons or Grim Reapers), but not those who are completely erased from the timeline or imprisoned in extra-dimensional spaces like the Citadel or the Asylum. This is a bonus action. Twice per session. 52: Touching Reunion - Once per session, ‘Can We Ever Meet Again?’ can be used as an anytime action. It costs 3 additional Stamina to do so."
ability,Oz,Cycle of Life and Death,3,,"Oz digs a bag of tiny seeds out of their pocket and throws one up to 5 spaces away. Oddly, all of the seeds look like they’re already old and broken. However, the seed they throw immediately blooms into a massive tree or plant of their choice that’s 4x4 spaces in size. Everyone in the area where the plant grows takes 6 damage and is blasted outside the area. The plant has 10 Stamina and can do whatever Oz wants within the scope of the chosen plant (although magical, witchy plants can be chosen), acting on their turns if it has an action. Oz cannot have more than two plants out at once with this ability. Oz can also use this ability for a variety of more niche purposes that are a bit less effective in combat itself, such as restoring an object to its previous state or causing something to decay and become more fragile."
weapon,Peony,Magic Stick,,,"4 Damage, 3 Range. Peony’s Magic Wand gains a new special ability! Every two times that a target is damaged by it, the target takes additional damage equal to the pain Peony reflected or absorbed during the last round, if she did so (maximum of 6). Peony can then choose one of that targets limbs. That limb is temporarily numbed to the point of disuse, giving any attack that would normally need it disadvantage for 2 rounds. 19: Choose One: +1 damage and range to Peony’s wand. (5 and 4 now)"
talent,Peony,Just Ignore It!!,,,"It can’t hurt you if you don’t pay attention to it! Peony is not affected by over-time damage, such as poison or bleeding. 22: No Pain, My Gain - Upgrade to ‘Just Ignore It!’.  Peony is now able to ignore the pain she’s feeling even more effectively than before!  She is now resistant to emotional or psychic damage, and once per combat, when she would be reduced below 0 Stamina after taking 10 damage or less from an attack, she is instead set to 1/4th of her maximum Stamina, rounded down."
passive,Peony,A Magical Girl Doesn’t Need Arms!!,,,"Once per combat, when Peony is attacked she can lose a limb instead. After one round the limb turns into a smaller Peony with ¼ her max health, rounded down. This second Peony acts on the original’s turn and has her base kit. The Peony clone continues to persist between combats, meaning if there are multiple combats in a single session Peony can have more than one clone. After a clone’s stamina is depleted it dies and can not be revived. Peony’s limbs regrow after combat. 3: Full Of Life (And Pain) - When Peony’s clones are created, they can immediately take an action that costs 1 less Stamina than usual. 24:  Sturdy Sisters - Peony’s clones now start with Stamina equal to 1/3rd of her maximum Stamina, rounded down."
passive,Peony,Roll20 Is A Bitch-ass Motherfucker,,,"Dude, what the fuck. Each time Peony rolls a natural 6 or lower during a combat, she gets a stacking +1 bonus to her rolls until she rolls a natural 17 or higher. This has nothing to do with her epithet or magic source, I’m just mad."
ability,Peony,Oceanic Ice Blast!!,3,,"It’s time for a magical attack! Peony waves her Magic Wand in the air, summoning a large ball of icy water, crashing down in a 3x3 area of her choice, dealing 5 damage to anyone in it. 5 Prof - Peony can now channel the other inherent elements of the ocean, such as the steaming hot vents or vast caverns, to make her ‘Oceanic Ice Blast’ deal damage of any elemental type she wishes (Earth, Water, Air, Fire).

ability,Peony,Sub-Zero Ice Punch!,1,,"Peony coats one of her arms in thick ice crystals as cold as the arctic ocean, and punches an opponent in melee range.  This deals 5 damage initially, and also gives them a small penalty on their next roll due to crippling brain freeze.  If the same target is hit with this ability multiple times in the same combat, more and more ice begins coating their body, which Peony can manipulate to hinder or restrain a target, or do minor damage over time if she wishes.

Any allies that stand within a 25 foot radius of the slime can fuse any aspect of their character sheet they wish with another ally who is also standing in the aura. This can effectively allow allies to perform dual-techs without the second ally needing to use their action or hold their turn to do so, and can also allow weapons, passives, or talents to be used in strange and chaotic ways depending on what they fuse with. The slime lasts for 2 rounds, and has 8 Stamina. Each time Pluto or her allies use the slime, the slime loses 3 Stamina, and it can also be destroyed by enemies. Only one slime can be out at a time, and the cost of this ability increases by 1 each time it’s used in the same combat."

If a magical item or spell would enter said aura they are able to tell very basic things about said magic spell or item as well as its location. They also may apply Practical Knowledge to anything within the aura as long as they spend 1 stamina. This is an intrinsic perception that vanilla has grown into, meaning it is not something that can simply be shut off."
passive,Chizu Chizu No Mi,"Yes, I Am Edible",,,"Your very body is edible.

When Vanilla would say the phrase “Am I the Only One Who Came Prepared For This?” or uses the ability “Am I the Only One Who Came Prepared For This?” a very unstable and very dangerous magical item then appears next to Vanilla with a note attached to it with the phrase “Can you test this one out for me? xoxo”. Said item is determined by Rob ahead of time and said item is a counter to the encounter Vanilla would find themselves in. The item will be dangerous to use but potentially extremely useful for the situation so use it wisely. Said item is then added to a separate field testing list that can only be accessed if Vanilla pays 1/20th (rounded up) of their maximum stamina.

ability,Vanilla,Simple Magic,0,,"Bonus action, thrice per combat. Vanilla in their down time has been trying to learn and understand the concepts and teachings of magic. They are not a prodigy in the magical arts however which means they have a long road and meticulous road to walk. However knowing and understanding what lies at the end of this path, may prove more useful than they originally intended. This ability as of right now allows Vanilla to perform magic at a very low level. Damage and healing originating from the magical spell/ability is currently not possible at vanilla’s skill level. However with smart thinking and a smart application of this low level magic, can yield promising outcomes. This Ability will change over time as Vanilla uses it and can potentially be molded into a spell of their own design."

passive,Maybe,Exists?,,,"Whether or not Maybe exists is really questionable. They might just be a collective hallucination. Who knows? Maybe can’t physically touch anything and any wounds on them disappear when you aren't looking. This also means Maybe is immune to status effects that represent physical ailments (like bleed or burning), as well as not being affected by certain elements of the stage. When she passes out she sort of just disappears into a nebous haze and reappears later. As a small lore thing, people find it hard to say anything definitive about Maybe without some ambiguity involved, even if the thing is plainly obvious.

The GM has final say in this. Once per round."
ability,Timony,All Rise,1,,"Tim can try to make anything into a court procession on his turn, charging a target with a crime. Tim acts as the prosecution, while anyone else can step in and try to rebuke him.

passive,Tristan,Fuck the Popo,,,"You’re too cool to follow the roolz!

ability,Tristan,From the Hood Represent,0!,,"Tristan throws some awesome gang signs and looks totally “epic”. This causes a currently active attack to be redirected directly at his face to cure his continued existence. Of course getting beat up in a fight gives Tristan some street cred, so this also gives him +1 movement for the rest of combat. Once per round."
ability,Tristan,Welcome to My Crib ,3,,"Tristan pulls out some object or merchandise he’s bought at some point, seemingly summoning it from his room. He then channels his epithet throughout the object, causing an effect related to it to manifest out. For example, he could pull out this totally lit poster he bought once with all these flames and skeletons and stuff from his favorite band, and then launch flames and hellfire upon the enemy or make something a skeleton! Of course, you need to explain your thought process on why you, specifically Tristan, would buy this."

Gravitational pull does not affect living creatures, but can affect entities that living creatures are piloting/wearing."
ability,Jacques,Warp World,1!,,"Jacques causes an object to seemingly stretch and morph as if folded and curved by space, essentially causing a segment of it to disappear from one place and pop out somewhere else.

weapon,Cerulean,Headset With Mic,,,Good for shouting into. Really projects the voice and makes you look cute while doing it. 3 range 4 damage.
talent,Cerulean,In The Groove,,,"Cerulean’s used to working with music in the background, so if there is ever music playing in-world (not just the jukebox for the sake of the game itself), she gains a +5 boost to all of her rolls. No, using her headphones to listen to a portable MP3 Player does not count for this buff, giving her a +1 instead and making it hard for her to hear her teammates."

Every time she successfully performs an action involving her voice, she gains +1 Rhythm Point (which is tracked by use of a red stat).

If she expends an extra stamina point, this can be used as a free action on her turn."
ability,Cerulean,Took The Words Out of My Mouth,?,,"Not only is Cerulean’s own voice distinct, but she’s also good at imitating other people’s distinct voices! Specifically, she can take the words she has heard someone else say and replicate them herself, causing an effect based off of it to occur. If desired, she can use this to use someone else’s ability so long as she’s seen it being used before. The stamina cost depends on the end result of this ability, and if she uses someone else’s ability it simply takes that ability’s cost."
ability,Cerulean,Vocal Chord Tuning,2!,,"With a snap, Cerulean creates a literal chord that connects her and a chosen unit. While the cord is connected, they can both talk using each others’ voices, which allows the other unit to use Cerulean’s abilities and for Cerulean to use any of their abilities activated by the use of their voice. Since Cerulean is the one in control, she can also force the connected unit to use her abilities at the same time she does to amplify their effect.

passive,Kitsuko,Suzuri no tamashii,,,"Due to her unique form of existence, Kitsuko isn’t entirely corporeal, but rather formed essentially from ink. Because of this, physical attacks deal slightly less damage to her, unless the attacker can find and strike the inkstone she keeps hidden in her body that she was formed from. Managing to attack this inkstone causes the attack to do slightly more damage than normal."
ability,Kitsuko,Inky Assistant,3,,"Kitsuko extends her arm out with finger outstretched, and lets a drop of her ink fall to the floor. When it hits the ground, it suddenly begins pooling, before forming into an inky figure based on one of the characters in one of her stories. This inky assistant has the abilities of this character, whatever you say those are. The better the justification, the better the summons. Up to two of these can be on the field at any one time."
ability,Kitsuko,Retcon,1!,,"Because of the nature of her epithet and her existence, Kitsuko can re-write the definitions of anything she has created with her epithet (including herself). She can do this as a free action on her turn once per round, replacing one aspect of her creations with something else (like giving herself increased strength or a new weapon, or changing a summon’s powerset). The more fitting the change is to the character as they have been described in Kituko’s story so far, the more powerful the effect will actually be, while particularly un-fitting changes may be weak or not take effect at all, even with a good role. Furthermore, changing any one thing too many times makes the character less defined, which can lead to decreased power overall."
ability,Kitsuko,Recurring Villainess,1,,"Naturally, since Kitsuko’s appearance is based on a character from many of her author’s books, she has built up powers to combat powerful heroes. What are those powers? Well obviously they’re [REDACTED]. When using this ability, Kitsuko uses some ability or power from her stories that she probably would have had. Powers with more reasonable justifications or that fit in with previously established powers are easier to use."

He does have to pay the cost and it cannot hit the same target. [28] Flowmotion - Sonder gains +1 damage on Weaving Drive for each target he chains Parry Drive to, object or not, for each chain after the first the failure range increases by 2. This extra damage goes away after the chain ends."
ability,Sonder,Blessing,1!,,"The ribbon from Sonder’s Weaver splits off to form a bracelet, gifting an ally 2 spaces away a 5 stamina heal or a +5 to a roll of their choice. Once per round. [11] Optionally, Sonder may take all of his pending damage to increase a character’s natural abilities such as their strength or dexterity. The more pending damage taken, the more effective this is. [37] Blessed Blessing - Bloodstone Blessing and Blessing’s anytime usages are not tied to each other anymore. Additionally, their base effectiveness is multiplied by 2.5 rounded up."
ability,Sonder,Lotus Hip Flask,1!,,Negates any overtime damage to the previous and next incoming attack. Once per round. [DB] Nullify - The Lotus Hip Flash additionally removes one status effect of the target's choice upon consumption. [22] Brew for the Soul - Sonder’s allies within 2 spaces take 1 less stamina cost until the end of their turn. 
ability,Sonder,Bloodstone Blessing,1!,,"Guiding energy through his bloodstone wand, Sonder deals 5 damage and grants a -3 to the target’s roll. In return, Sonder gains an unstackable +1 to Blessing’s next use. [37] Blessed Blessing - Bloodstone Blessing and Blessing’s anytime usages are not tied to each other anymore. On top of that, their base effectiveness is multiplied by 2.5 rounded up."
ability,Sonder,Stand Our Ground,3,,"Sonder grants an invisible spirit guide on an ally which hovers near and assists them in battle. If the user performs an action, the spirit can either set their roll to 10, negate a critical fail to some extent, or repeat the action at half effectiveness on something of the user’s choice. This spirit can also function as utility such as retrieving items, moving units 2-3 spaces in any direction, or generally interacting with the environment. Only 4 of these things can be done before the spirit returns to Sonder."
weapon,Doppler,Invertention,,,"Doppler’s signature precision rifle. From how it’s zeroed in, she can only accurately shoot when her target is within a sweet-spot of 5 to 7 for 7 damage. Shooting a target outside of the sweet-spot must be rolled for disadvantage and deals 5 damage. Past 7 spaces, targets will be increasingly difficult to hit."
talent,Doppler,Ego Retention System,,,"You do not need to worry about Doppler being unable to take damage. While she used to be a human and is now a hologram, her programming has her blissfully unaware of this to prevent her from having a violent, mind-splitting existential crisis. Thus, it simulates pain whenever she were to take damage (though it will not connect). This programming additionally censors words that refer to her as robotic and make her look human when looking into anything reflective."
talent,Doppler,Sleight of Hand,,,"Her immense experience with firearms has made her precision almost surgical. Outside of combat, rolls based on accuracy or dexterity have a +4."
passive,Doppler,Tunnel Vision,,,"With her incredible focus manifesting through her epithet, the trails of her shots leave an epithetical tunnel that extends the range of anything that passes through it, end to end and parallel. Once she fires a new shot, the tunnel changes."
ability,Doppler,Seismic EMP,2!,,"Burst of air that sends anyone adjacent to her back 6 spaces as well as disabling electronics for half a round, rounded up. Once per round."
ability,Doppler,ExAcTO Round,3,,"Stands for EXtremely ACcurate Tactical Ordnance. As a twice per combat action, Doppler loads and shoots her rifle with a high velocity, armor piercing, anti-material round that ignores wind, drag, and gravity. Can penetrate through units. Ignores damage reduction and roll disadvantage from the weapon’s normal text."
ability,Doppler,Amped,4!,,"Holographic nanobots are sent to 2 allies to surge their adrenaline temporarily. For that single turn it is activated, said allies are granted a main action, their basic weapon’s damage is increased by 4, and an anytime action of the targets’ choice is refreshed. Requires a full 2 rounds to reuse. Failures take up a usage."
ability,Peony,Magical Girl Technique - Painful Ballet,3⛯,,"Once per combat, Peony can use her main and movement action to assume the graceful stance of a ballet performer, twirling and twirling, while a thin sheet of ice also manifests beneath her, allowing her to glide across the ground like a professional figure skater.  Upon using this ability, Peony gains movement equal to triple her movement speed, and glides across the arena however she chooses.  All spaces that she glides across are covered with slippery ice that acts as difficult terrain and also deals 1 damage to enemies specifically per space they step on. In addition, Peony marks all targets she passes adjacent to with this ability with a different status depending on whether they’re friend or foe.  Allies get stacks of ‘Numb’, which decreases damage they take by the number of stacks they have, and each time they take damage, one stack is lost.  Enemies, however, gain stacks of ‘Pain’.  A target with Pain stacks that deals damage to another target has an amount of that damage reflected back on themselves (reducing the damage dealt as well) equal to their stacks.  Each time they deal damage, half of their Pain stacks (rounded down, minimum of 1) are lost. Peony can pass adjacent to the same target multiple times with this ability, but not the same target multiple times in a row - she must apply a stack to another target before returning to the previous."

passive,Amilla,Lurking Fear,,,"Enemies affected by Amilla’s will take stacks of Fear. Everyone (accept Amilla) can accrue up to 30 stacks of Fear, upon being afflicted with max stacks of Fear, the Victim must make a Sanity save (1d4). If the Victim is healed they are cleaned stacks equal to the amount they were healed On a Fail (1, 2, 3): They roll a 1d3, gain the Affliction. Lasts until Victim is brought to 0 Fear. 1 - Masochistic: Victim will not defend itself, and if there’s no target in range (even with movement) it’ll basic attack itself 2 - Irrational: Victim cannot see the difference between friend and foe, must take a move action in a random direction 1d8 (must move at least 1) 3 - Abusive: Victim will actively and continuously berate allies applying Fear, the amount is determined by how well they roll to berate their allies. 4 - On a Pass: All stack of Fear are removed, and all allies within 3 sqrs. They lose half their Fear stacks"
passive,Amilla,Taste Their Fear,,,"As a free action, once per round Amilla can target someone and roll to learn their greatest fear. Using a fear that aligns with Taste their Fear doubles the effectiveness of the Fear stacks."

Abusive - The person is abusive even to themselves, stacking fear along with their teammates 3. Masochistic - They even enjoy hurting themselves, hurting themselves for 2 damage every time they fail at doing something."

talent,Julius,Sugar Rush,,,"When Julius or an ally is affected by his abilities, on their next turn, they gain a +1 to movement. (Note: Boost only applies on their next turn)"
passive,Julius,Expendable Exocarp,,2,"“You can’t kill an Aussie that easily.” Julius can only be K.O.ed if he is brought to exactly 0 stamina. If brought below 0 stamina, Julius becomes Peeled for 1 round per stamina below zero. While in the Peeled state, Julius’ abilities have a different name, effect, and cost (which are written in Orange). He can only cast Peeled abilities whilst in the Peeled state, and can only cast normal abilities in his normal state. If Peeled ends before Julius is healed above 0, he is K.O.ed"
ability,Julius,Coconut Concoction,3,,"Gives an ally within 3 squares 4 armour. Armour placed on ally cannot be replenished, target must lose all armour before gaining more.

weapon,Cherri/Charlotte,Tweedle Yo-Yo's,,,"Two power packed children’s toys that realistically should not be let into the hands of a child. The left is named Tweedle Dee, and the right is Tweedle Dum. When used as a direct melee weapon, they deal 4 damage initially, and if the first hit connects, Charlotte/Cherri can roll to hit once more for slightly lower damage. Or, by choosing to forego the second attack chance, the Yo-Yo’s can extend to have a 2 space range instead."
talent,Cherri/Charlotte,Toy Lover To Toy Maker,,,"These girls know toys inside and out, and could probably make a toy out of just about anything. As such, they can take objects they find and incorporate them into toys that they can then use as items with little to no issue."
ability,Cherri,Loaded Deck,3⛯,,"Once per combat. Cherri: Cherri wants a good friend, and what better friend is there than a giant living and breathing card soldier? Once summoned, the soldier acts both as Cherri’s bodyguard, blocking potentially dangerous attacks, and as an assist in whatever way Cherri needs them. They have 10 stamina."
ability,Cherri,All According To Keikaku,3⛯,,"Once per combat. Cherri: Cherri has a metric shitton of toys to choose from, but who could choose only one? Instead, Cherri has decided to use a bunch of them to create a Rube-Goldberg machine of her own design. Go nuts."
ability,Cherri,Pop! Goes The Dodo!,1!,,"Cherri: As a once per round anytime action, Cherri can attempt to spook someone around her with a sudden dodo themed jack in the box. This forces the target back at least one space, and on high rolls, may even end their turn immediately."
ability,Cherri,What A Mess We've Made,1,,"Cherri: Who needs regular bouncy balls when you’ve got explosive bouncy balls? With this ability, Cherri can produce a few “Cherri” Bombs that she can either place as traps or throw at something immediately. If set as a trap, she can choose how many turns they will take to blow up, with longer wait times correlating to more powerful explosions."
ability,Charlotte,Loaded Deck,3⛯,,"Once per combat. Charlotte: With a commanding snap, Charlotte summons a small armada of card soldiers to act at her beck and call. Once summoned, she gives them a command, and then the platoon will fight on until they either complete their mission or are stopped. If she desires, she can split them into two groups, but as smaller groups they are slightly less effective."
ability,Charlotte,All According To Keikaku,3⛯,,"Once per combat. Charlotte: Charlotte may play with toys, but she’s more for the sophisticated kinds when she has a choice. Croquet is an example of a pastime she very much so enjoys, and with this ability, she can set up a chain with three steeples that, when she decides to hit her ball, will guide the ball down a specific path. Anyone in the way of this path will take a hefty amount of damage."
ability,Charlotte,Pop! Goes The Dodo!,1,,"Charlotte: With a devilish smile, Charlotte tosses a small, wind-up box onto the ground. If any enemy unit steps onto a space adjacent to it, a dodo bird will pop out from the box and launch an attack towards them. If Charlotte wishes to do so, she can spend 3 stamina instead of 1 to make the Dodo Sentry more powerful. Only one sentry can be on the field at a time."
ability,Charlotte,What A Mess We've Made,1,,"Charlotte: Charlotte can throw out a set of jacks to act as a prickly trap for anyone who is unfortunate to face a “LEGOs on the ground at 2 AM situation”. They take up a space when placed, deal slight damage when stepped on, and reduce the movement of the hit unit on their next turn."
weapon,Vulture,Scavenger,,,"A glove Vulture wears on his right hand featuring sharp, talon-like claws on the fingers. They’re quite long, needlessly long even, and it looks like he hasn’t cleaned the blood off them in years. Actually, it smells pretty bad at this point. 5 damage as a melee weapon and can inflict a Bleeding Status Effect on particularly high rolls. 20. Disease Ridden - Due to Vulture’s refusal to clean off Scavenger, the blood on it has hardened and become generally very nasty. When he uses Scavenger as a basic attack, it inflicts a 1 turn status effect onto hit targets on rolls higher than 10. This deals 1d4 damage at the start of their next turn and then goes away."
talent,Vulture,Ow the Edge,,,"It is an inevitability that when Vulture’s around, he will spout some edgy bullshit that sounds like it should’ve been left in the early 2000s. Whenever he makes one of these remarks after performing an equally edgy action, he gains a proficiency point. "
passive,Vulture,Bloodbath Ritual,,,"Blood is not only a really good source of edgy imagery, but it also does something actually practical when it comes into contact with Vulture. When someone else’s blood is spilt upon him or his weapon, he gains the choice to either increase his base damage or his movement by 1, or to receive a point in his “Blood Pool”, which can be used to add larger amounts of blood to his abilities and thereby increasing their potency. As a side note, when he uses these Blood Pool points, he slices a gash open in his palm to let the blood out, even though he could probably do something less dramatic. 18. State of Decay - If Vulture attacks a unit that is already unconscious, the boost he gets from his Passive is boosted to two. So, either an increase in his base damage or his movement by 2, or receiving two points in his Blood Pool."
ability,Vulture,Dying Message,2,,"Emulating the cliché of writing one’s last words in their own blood, Vulture licks his fingers before spreading some red across the ground. He can either write a sentence, and that sentence will become true, or he can draw a symbol/object of some kind and interpret an effect from there. Using a Blood Pool Point allows him to write/draw out two things at once."
ability,Vulture,Final Moments,1,,"Vulture performs the classic samurai technique of “slash through someone, wait a second for them to realize what has happened, and then have a fountain of blood spew out from their body.” When he does this, he travels 4 spaces in a given direction and attacks anyone he passes through. This deals a fair bit of damage, but most importantly, guarantees a Blood Pool Point for each person he hits."
ability,Vulture,Dark Arsenal,1!,,"When he’s bored of the usual method of killing, Vulture likes experimenting with new weapons. Specifically, he can take any blood currently within his eyesight and solidify it into a weapon of his choice. If there is no blood present on the field, and Vulture does not want to spend a Blood Pool Point, he can pay an extra stamina point to damage himself and make some more blood appear."
ability,Vulture,Blood Clot,1!,,"Vulture likes his prey to sit still and watch as he brings their life to an end. Thus, with this ability, he is able to take blood from within him and transfer it into someone else incorrectly, mixing incompatible blood types to screw with their vessels. This stuns the chosen target, and the degree of this stun is, even more so than his other abilities, tied to his use of Blood Pool Points. Without Blood Pool Points, it simply reduces the strength of an action. Using one point, he is able to cancel an action as an interrupt. Using two points, he can cancel an action and cut their movement in half for their next turn. Continuing to use higher amounts of points further scales the ability. Once per round."
weapon,Candy,Spooky Pumpkin Bucket,,,"Truly the greatest weapon of this beautiful era. Candy can bash someone really, really hard with it for 5 damage. - Spooky, eh? - #1 - Candy's bucket deals more damage the more candy is in it. "

passive,Candy,How did I even got bound to this thing again?,,0,"Candy is stuck haunting objects and not having a body of her own. She can only float on or adjacent to whatever object she’s possessing (though movement is a free action for her to make up for it...A bit.). Candy, being a ghost, also can’t have human things done to her. Like being lit on fire or poisoned. This being said, she can be attacked and take damage normally. Her rock is also small enough to be carried, which is very important considering *she can’t move herself ;-;*"
ability,Candy,Poltergeist,1!,1,"Candy focuses really really hard and temporarily possesses an object, moving it around or activating it to whatever effect she may desire."
ability,Candy,GHOST PUNCH!,3⛯,2,"Once per Combat, Candy can rev up her ultimate punch. This deals 1 damage to the target...But far more importantly, knocks their soul out of their body! In a panic, she quickly possesses them to make sure nothing bad happens to their body while they’re temporarily away. In this soul form, the enemy that got their SOUL knocked out can only affect Candy, and with enough damage, can get their body back. They still have all of their abilities and attacks and such, but can only interact with other ghosts/their own body, and the possibility of there being multiple ghosts is...small. Meanwhile, Candy can use the attacks and abilities (using her own stamina) of whoever she may have possessed, just to try them out, obviously. She can never possess someone else permanently for a new body, that’d be mean ;-;"
ability,Candy,I WILL PROTECT YOU WITH MY LIIIIIFE,1!,1,"Candy intercepts an attack that she can go to, taking the damage instead. *Candy is most likely dead."
weapon,Skilton,Buttersock,,,"Sweaty gym sock filled with ultra compacted butter to form a flail. Hurts a lot. Specifically, 5 damage with 2 spaces of range."
talent,Skilton,Stomach of Steel,,,"After eating so much dirt, Skilton's stomach has toughened up to the point where it can digest just about anything."
passive,Skilton,Motor Mouthed Mafioso,,,"Taking after the effects of motor oil lubricant, attacks that connect with Skilton have their kinetic energy transferred into heat through conduction. Skilton then gains half of the damage taken as “Exhaust Points” that can literally be burned to increase either the direct result of a roll or the damage of one of Skilton’s attacks as clouds of smoke puff out from his mouth. The boost to rolls and damage are a direct 1-to-1 conversion from how many Exhaust Points are used, and if this is used to boost the result of a roll then it can’t boost damage on the same turn and vice versa. When spending Exhaust if you spend all of it at once and the amount is greater than or equal to 4, you get an additional +2 to the effect’s result."
ability,Skilton,Smooth Criminal,1,,"Skilton can place oil onto a space within 5 spaces of him. If an enemy is on the space he slicks, they take 1-2 damage. Depending on the roll, this can potentially cover multiple spaces. Each time an enemy steps onto a slicked space, they must roll to see if they slip. If they do, they must roll for damage. Whenever Skilton is on a space that's covered in oil, he can move two spaces for the cost of one."
ability,Skilton,Petroleum Petrification,1!,,"With a clap, Skilton hardens the oil (and this applies to any type of oil) within something or on something to the point where it’s rusted as hard and solid as a rock. This can be used to stop something in its tracks, or on Skilton or one of his allies to give them armor or damage buffs through oil coatings."
ability,Skilton,Light Em Up,3,,"Skilton lights a match made of oil which he can throw up to 5 spaces away, causing it to explode in a blaze of glory. It deals a massive amount of burn damage, as well as ignites any slicked spaces adjacent to it."
ability,Skilton,Rig-or Mortis,3,,"Cause the oil in something to “dry up”, causing said thing to shut down for a short amount of time. The oil that’s drained is then stored within your person, granting you the ability to fire said oil out in a spray as an anytime. You can only do one oil spray a round. The oil you drain will naturally replenish after a while… probably."
weapon,Father Fury,The Bible Belt,,,"Father Fury never goes anywhere without his trusty Pastodor Champion’s Belt. His honor as a wrestler binds him to fight with only his body, and so his primary attacks consist of melee and grappling. At 1 range he can perform various melee attacks or wrestling moves on a target for 6 damage on average, but up to 10 damage on a  crit."
talent,Father Fury,Divine Tag-In,,,"Wrestling is the second most sacred thing to Mr. Fury besides The Lord. One of the greatest tenants from his chapter is teamwork. If anyone offers a dual tech with him (not the other way around), he can use his holy connections to pray advantage onto all recipients’ rolls.  "
passive,Father Fury,Rules of The Ring,,,"When an enemy rolls to make an attack that is adjacent to him, Father Fury can activate this passive. If its roll matches/exceeds the initial attack roll, father fury is able to counter by grappling the assailant. The damage of the grapple is the same as the intended melee attack. When dealing with a ranged attack such as a projectile, Father fury can activate this passive to swat that oncoming attack away from him. Only cheaters and villains attack from a distance.  "
ability,Father Fury,The Lord's Tackle,1,,"Father Fury commits to a sick shoulder bash at an opponent. The tackle itself allows him to move an extra two spaces in one direction, and deals around 6 damage to its target on average. 20. Checkmate, Atheists - The Lord’s Tackle now, on rolls above 15, knocks hit targets 2 spaces away and halves their next movement action."
ability,Father Fury,Faith or Fury,1!,,"Father Fury reaches into his priestly robes (Official Pastodor gear) to pull out an item one of two ways. Inside his large robe pockets is a small cross, and Father Fury has large, meaty hands. Either he can pull out a cross being held upright, or held inverted (1d2 to decide which). Pulling out a regular causes him to pray, healing him for 1d4 health. Pulling out an inverted cross fills him with a desire for divine vengeance, allowing him to cause 1d4 extra damage on his next attack (his rage cannot stack, if he doesn’t use it by his turn, the effect disappears)."
ability,Father Fury,Righteous Retribution,3,,"Powered by divine light possibly from the lord himself, Father Fury jumps into the air and delivers a powerful atomic elbow. This elbow smites any enemy directly under it with 8 damage, and has an AoE effect of heavenly radiance cracking the ground that causes 5 damage across one space all around him.    "
weapon,Sara,Titanium-toed slippers,,,"Light, fashionable, and painful to be flash kicked by. 4 damage. Adds 1 to her Spin when she attacks. 29: Choose One: Sara’s basic weapon deals +2 damage, or it now adds 3 Spin when it’s used."
talent,Sara,Gyroscope,,,"Sara is extremely resistant to anyone (but herself) that tries to stop her flips. Anyone who tries to move Sara forcibly must roll 1d20 - Spin in order to do so. 32: Acrobatic Mastery - Upgrade for ‘Gyroscope’. It’s almost impossible to forcibly restrain or hinder Sara’s movement (they have to roll 1d20 - (Spin) to do so), and certain barriers or terrain difficulties that would hinder most people are nothing to her. She can casually backflip a dozen feet through the air, easily balance on the tips of sharp spikes, or anything else she could reasonably pirouette her way out of. If she needs to make a roll for doing any of this, she makes it with advantage."
talent,Sara,Spinning Sprinter,,,"Sara can now spend 2 Stamina on her turn to double move, even if she’s already taken an action on her turn."
talent,Sara,Unnamed Upgrade,,,"Once per combat, Sara can ignore a paralyzing or restraining effect she is under for a single main action unless that effect was dealt by an Outclass or Overclass."
talent,Sara,Whole World's An Obstacle Course,,,"At the start of  combat, Sara can choose two obstacles or props that one might see in an  obstacle course or parkour arena.  Conveniently enough, those two  obstacles appear in the arena.  The GM chooses their locations."
talent,Sara,Spin Artist,,,"When Sara uses one of the following attacks or abilities, she can spend 3 Stamina and 3 Spin to give it the corresponding additional effect.  She must choose to do so before rolling.  She can only use each effect once per round. - Titanium-toed Slippers:  Pierces all forms of physical DR, and if the target is knocked back, Sara can instead knock them in a direction of her choice. - Keep On Rolling:  All enemies Sara damages with this are knocked prone unless they are class 3 or higher, and each enemy successfully knocked prone in this way will refresh the amount of spaces she has left to roll. - Do A Barrel Roll:  The ally Sara uses this on can immediately make a counter-attack on the enemy who attacked them or move up to their movement speed.  The counter-attack cannot combo in any way. - Fatal Flow:  A target knocked back by this ability can no longer “come to a stop” or have their movement halted by anything less than an Outclass or Overclass-level effect.  If they hit an immensely solid obstacle such as a very thick wall, then their movement is slowed as they break through it, but they will still travel a decent number of spaces into it, taking damage for each space as though they had broken through an obstacle -  - Pressure Point Pummeling:  The once per two rounds usage of this ability is not used up, and Sara can also disable aspects of the target’s kit that are not what she is currently being attacked with as long as she has seen it be used.  If she does so, it is only disabled for 1 round.  The same thing cannot be disabled in this way twice in the same combat.  Multiple things cannot be disabled at the same time."
passive,Sara,Spin me right round,,,"Anyone watching Sara perform always notices that she becomes faster as the performance goes on. Sara has an additional stat called ""Spin"", which steadily increases as she performs actions. If Sara does not move or perform a Spin-related action during the turn, the Spin stat reduces by 1.  Various moves either add or subtract from the Spin stat. As her Spin rises, she reaches new speeds, making her more powerful. Mach 1 is at 3 Spin, and adds 2 damage to her attacks. Mach 2 is at 7 Spin. It adds another 1 to her damage, and 2 to her movement. Mach 3 is at 12 Spin. She can take a second action, and anyone who ends their turn next to her has to roll or be knocked back 2 squares. SPPPEEeeeeEEEEeeeeennnNNNNN! - Sara now gains 2 Spin simply by moving on her turn. Double moving gets 5 Spin. 47: So This Is The Power Of Ultra Spinstinct - This is to spin EVEN FURTHER BEYOND! Sara’s maximum Spin increases to 16, and she no longer suffers negative effects from being at Mach 3. However, 16 Spin is now Mach 4. While in Mach 4: - Her movement speed is doubled. - She deals 3 additional damage on top of the previous increases.  - All of her anytimes can be used one additional time per round while in Mach 4.  - Every time she deals damage, enemies are knocked back a number of spaces equal to the damage if she chooses to do so.  - She can move, attack, and move again.  - However, all of Sara’s Stamina costs in this state are increased by 2, and even actions that wouldn’t normally take Stamina now cost 1, including attacking and moving. In addition, Sara takes 3 damage at the end of each of her turns. 50: Emergency Beyblade Technique - Once per round, while in Mach 2 or higher, Sara can spend double her Spin instead of spending Stamina cost on abilities. The effects of having lower Spin take effect before the ability is used. 60: Controlling The Rate At Which SpeEEEeeeeEEEEN - Once per combat, Sara can spend 5 Stamina to set herself to any Spin value she wants at the start of her turn."

passive,Sara,Internal Axis Of The Heart,,,"Even the inside of Sara’s heart is always spinning, spinning, spinning. From one friend to another, from one challenge to the next; whatever Sara faces, the memory of those she’s met lingers on and powers her like an engine! - For every 15 Companionship Sara has, she gets 1 ‘Armor’ at the start of a session. It acts as temporary Stamina above her maximum, and it cannot be spent as cost, healed, or restored by any means. - For every 25 Companionship Sara has, she gains 1 movement during her first turn of combat only. - For every 50 Companionship Sara has, she gains 1 maximum Stamina. - For every 70 Companionship Sara has, she gains a once-per-session reroll that acts as advantage. - For every 100 Companionship Sara has, her movement increases by 1. - For every 150 Companionship Sara has, she gains one new ability based on a combination of two of the individuals she has Companionship with.

ability,Sara,Fatal Flow,3,,"All that G Force has got to go somewhere, and Sara can choose where. So long as Sara has been in constant movement and building up spin, she can come to a stop and touch an enemy. They are sent spinning in a direction, moving spaces equal to Sara's Spin. If they hit an obstacle they can pass through, they take damage equal to half of Sara's Spin and break through it. If they are forced to come to a stop they take damage equal to twice Sara's Spin, minus 2 for every obstacle hit. If they fail to hit anything, they are nauseous, and all their rolls must be made with a negative equal to Spin inflicted on them for 1d3 turns. After this, Sara's spin resets to 0. If Sara fails to connect with this, she loses half of her Spin."
ability,Sara,Casual backflip,1!,,"Just a flip. Can be used to dodge attacks, and adds 1 to Sara’s Spin. Once per round. 36: Somerassault - When Sara uses ‘Casual Backflip’, she can move herself up to 5 spaces, and if she’s adjacent to an enemy when she uses it or is adjacent to one when she lands, they take 3 damage. 55: Right Back At Ya - On rolls of 15+, ‘Casual Backflip’ can now reflect attacks back at opponents, dealing about half of their full effects back to them."
ability,Sara,Breaking The Law,3,,"This ability can be used as a free action on Sara’s turn immediately after she makes a basic attack on a target. She makes a second attack on the same target, with the roll for this ability being the roll for the attack. Adds 1 to her Spin whether it succeeds or not. (Named for Marshall Law's seemingly endless backflip combos)"
ability,Sara,Pressure Point Pummelling,3!,,"Once per two rounds, when Sara is hit by a powerful attack or ability, she can attempt to perform a lightning fast counter-attack in response.  With the power of pure athleticism and her general knowledge of the physical body, Sara precisely targets the attack to take the brunt of it while making a vicious attack on a particular pressure point, dealing 5 damage and disabling the ability from being used again for 1d2+1 rounds.  The more strange or chaotic the source of the attack or the attack itself, the less effective this ability is.  If Sara is at Mach 2 or higher when she uses this, she rolls with advantage.  She can’t avoid the incoming attack and still use this ability."
weapon,Elijah,"A Weapon? Why, I Wouldn’t Dare",,,"Yeah, Elijah doesn’t actually have a weapon the closest thing he has is his reference book for safety things. He *could* use it to bap enemies for 2 damage at 1 range but he wouldn’t think of such a thing. Instead he just reads it to people, anyone (yes anyone) adjacent to him when he reads his book gains +1DR to all types of damage, yes this can stack but only to 3 and cannot be used on the same people multiple times in a row as they have to get their heads around the first set of rules. The buff lasts for 3 rounds but refreshes for the targets every time it’s used on them to gain the buff. (Does not refresh if at +3 already). Increase range to 2, the DR can only be gained by allies at the adjacent range but anyone can gain it at 2 range. Regardless of choice, weapon damage goes up by 1 as the page number increases. 56 - Weapon Upgrade - Elijah can now be affected by his own weapon but only the amount of rounds that he has DR stack and not the amount DR. Regardless the damage on his weapon is increased by 2, there’s so many pages now, holy moly."
talent,Elijah,Danger's Biggest Enemy,,,"If Elijah is the last one standing on his team he goes into a “Safety Rage” at all the dangerous violence that has happened. - His damage on all attacks is increased by 8 and he gains DR 4 (which can stack with any DR he already had) he can increase one of these or his movement by 1 every round. However he may no longer use his passives, weapons or abilities on himself (he is still affected by things already set up). This has a stamina upkeep of 1. Upon becoming the last man standing he may take an out of turn movement and action and it must be towards the unconscious ally in the most danger, he may then use his action to either attack the closest adjacent enemy to them (he may choose to automatically succeed with an 11 or roll as normal) OR get a healing action that can heal an ally up to 8 stamina. If he is not the last one standing or the danger somehow passes after activation his damage and DR naturally deteriorates by 1 every round until his damage becomes base again or his DR becomes 0. When DR or Damage is lost it may not come back except through this talent. Once per combat. (50) This talent can be activated when Elijah has one or two allies remaining but will automatically start to deteriorate if he activates it then. However he may now also use Self Proclaimed Emperor of Safety and a single ability a round on himself while his talent is activated. This activation does not apply when he is on a team of 3 or less (including himself). Unless he is alone or started alone. (If the normal conditions of this talent are met it will stop deteriorating.)"
talent,Elijah,Safety Vest,,,"Elijah’s trusted reflective vest. With this on he feels invincible, which isn’t inaccurate. While he’s wearing the vest he may choose one specific hazardous thing to be immune to at the start of combat for the combat. (This may not be general stuff like “Damage” “Gravity” or “Stamina Costs”, nor does it give immunity to direct attacks of that type, but can be stuff like “Fire,” “Fall Damage” or “Toxic Waste”) He may also pass this vest on to others for them to gain that protection, but he loses it himself."
talent,Elijah,I Eat Safety For Breakfast,,,"A safe day always starts with a healthy breakfast, which gives him more energy to go about his safely duties. At the start of a session Elijah has 5 bonus stamina, if Elijah still has any of this bonus stamina at the end of a combat it heals to its max in addition to his normal heal but cannot be healed in other ways. Elijah may take his ability costs from his normal stamina or bonus stamina, damage is taken from bonus stamina first. If Stamina is chosen from the combat rewards Elijah may instead put it into his bonus stamina increasing its cap by that amount. (For the purposes of upgrades, the bonus stamina is gained immediately upon receiving this talent for the first time) The maximum bonus stamina cannot exceed his normal stamina. (29 Bonus Stamina). (??) Stamina taken from Elijah’s bonus stamina either through damage, stamina costs or other ways it is always reduced in some way. Physical (anything that physically affects you) damage is halved (rounded up (so if he took 5 damage, he would actually take 3)), Stamina cost is a minus 1 (to a minimum of 1) (unless it specifically takes from his bonus stamina in which case it remains the same) and other non-standard stamina damages etc are up to GM discretion. He can choose to take from either or in whichever case but things that ignore DR and defenses go straight to regular stamina. He is knocked out even if he has bonus stamina remaining."
talent,Elijah,That’s Not Very Safe Money Of You,,,"When an ally rolls a critical failure Elijah may roll to try and make it safer for them. On an 18+ the critical failure is negated and it is considered a minor success. On a 14+ the critical failure is negated, the failure still occurs however. On an 8+ he may choose to take the brunt of the failure for his ally should they be within 3 spaces or the range of the action (whichever is largest). 7 or less is considered a fail. This may only happen two times per combat and cannot be used on his own crit fails. Once per combat he may spend one third of his total max bonus stamina to completely cancel a crit of any kind by anyone. If used on a Nat1 the target of the cancellation may roll again with disadvantage but even on another Nat1 they cannot critically fail. If used on a Nat20 the target of the cancellation may roll again with advantage but even on another Nat20 they cannot critically succeed."
talent,Elijah,Earthen Defense,,,1 DR vs Earth based damage and such.
passive,Elijah,Self Proclaimed Emperor Of Safety,,,"Elijah is the ruler of safety and hates to see people get hurt, but he also has decided to his epithet to give him ruling privileges over anything safety related. When he or an adjacent ally is attacked he may put a shield of his own making into the way of the attack, this usually means putting pillows in the way of ranged attacks (to silence them), covering swords and other bladed weapons with safety foam and blunt weapons…..yeah I dunno, make something up, this greatly reduces damage or just cancels the attacks. This can happen once per round to defend himself and once per turn to defend an ally, but if he defends an ally before himself it *does* use up his once per round self defend. (31) Elijah’s once per round self defense is not used up if he defends an ally before himself in a round."
passive,Elijah,Ruling Privelage,,,"Elijah’s version of his epithet has given him ruling privilege over the concept of safety, this may start minor at first but the more proficiency he gains gives him more power over that concept allowing the user to do a bonus action on his turn of something related to Safety. The cost of this depends on the action performed and his proficiency level. (Decided by GM). (??) Elijah can smell danger from a mile away...probably. When entering a new area and at the start of combat the GM tells Elijah what 3 of the most dangerous things in the area are. This does not mean stuff like enemies or living things but more things like crumbling walls, uneven/wet floors or exposed wiring. Environmental stuff for the most part. (42) Elijah can now use the bonus action he has as a once per round anytime, but it will always cost at least 2 stamina to do so and cannot be reduced via bonus stamina, but could be increased depending on the action taken."
passive,Elijah,Establishing The Rules,,,"At the start of combat, Elijah states a rule. This can be any rule that isn’t immediately broken or something like “attacking”. If an enemy breaks that rule, Elijah gets a +2 to his rolls involving that rulebreaker for the rest of combat. Multiple rule breaks do not increase this. If an ally breaks that rule, they do not get the roll buff. They instead have a talk with Elijah afterwords about respecting the rules and why there’re there, along with a written apology. They cannot escape this."
ability,Elijah,OSHA Violation,2,,"Elijah’s looking around and wow, this place is looking pretty unsafe, are you sure it’s up to code? Elijah can point something out within eyesight and describe how that could be a danger to people, the thing he describes usually then happens immediately or after some time if the roll is too low. (10) If Elijah points out a Safety Violation that has already been proven to be a liability in this session, such as a tree falling or a wooden floor collapsing, (separate from Elijah’s interference) then he gains advantage on pointing it out."
ability,Elijah,STOP RIGHT THERE SAFETY CRIMINAL SCUM,2!,,"If anyone does anything obscenely dangerous or causes even minor property damage, Elijah can call them out on it and explain to them why it’s dangerous to do such things, after explaining all of this, the target has their action cancelled but they don’t spend stamina for it and Elijah heals for the stamina cost of the ability they tried to use for the good job he did. Once per round. (For RP purposes he may move freely during this but must return to his prior location). (16) When this ability is used on allies it allows them to reroll the ability instead of cancelling it but Elijah will only heal for 1 stamina instead of the ability cost. (37) Half of the stamina (rounding up) regained from STOP RIGHT THERE SAFETY CRIMINAL SCUM can be added to his bonus Stamina to heal it instead of his normal stamina but still cannot be restored if it hits 0. Any leftover goes into his regular stamina."
ability,Elijah,~sigh~ Get The Tape,3⛯,,"This place has been designated a class 5 safety violation and I must secure it. Elijah designates a 3x3 area and surrounds it in highly visible and resistant “safety tape” anyone already inside this area is forcibly removed from that area (by politely asking, he’s not a monster). If Elijah is inside this area he may spend 2 rounds to create and perfect “The Ultimate Safe Area” this area will heal allies for 2 stamina every round if they are stood inside it, naturally have DR1 and he may also add some small extra amenities of his choice to it. He has DR3 while creating it and cannot be removed under most circumstances by outside forces. Nothing is stopping other entities from entering the area but only allies will receive healing Once per combat."
ability,Elijah,NONONONONO WAITWAITWAITWAITWAIT,1!,,"Whoa there, that looks dangerous let me fix that up for you. Elijah can assist anyone in their actions and make them more safe for them by talking them through how they can improve themselves in the safety arts, this gives them either a lil’ boost or rerolling the dice. Once per round."
ability,Elijah,When Will You Learn That Your Actions Have Consequences?,4!⛯,,"Whenever someone fails at doing something dangerous (for example, firing a gun) Elijah explains to them about how potentially dangerous that action was and the unseen consequences that could arise from such a thing. After this, things continue as normal until a few turns or maybe even rounds have passed and the dangerous action that was taken has its consequences occur in a completely overblown fashion (for example, when the gun was fired the bullet ricocheted around and somehow causes a water pipe to back up and the built up pressure makes it explode into a high power jet of water the blasts the perpetrator). Once per combat. Once per round. (the player mainly decides what happens, but the GM has some say on what happens and when it occurs)."
ability,Elijah,Safe Passage,3,,"With the fervor of a boy scout helping an old lady across the street Elijah can assist a teammate complete their entire turn unhindered. Elijah can accompany an adjacent ally of their choice on their turn protecting them from harm, that ally’s action cannot be interrupted by anytimes and the likes and any damage they take this round may be taken by Elijah instead. Elijah may not use the protection from his passive during the round he uses this ability."
weapon,Dani,Dark Dagger,,,"4 damage melee. 3 damage at 4 range. You can use an opened Door of Darkness as the range for throwing but cannot target the owner of the shadow. (54) You may target the owner of a door to throw your dagger at, however doing so does not mark them with a door. (74) *teleports behind you*  - If you move to be behind a target with a Door of Darkness your dagger deals double damage/ against them that turn."
weapon,Dani,Cattail Derringer,,,"One shot should be more than enough to kill anything that moves. Single use. 5 damage, 5 range. If you manage to defeat an enemy with this, gain 1 proficiency and another Cattail Derringer. Can be repeated up to the 9th Cattail Derringer."
talent,Dani,Eternal Darkness,,,"Shadows will continue to exist until every light in the universe is extinguished, because of this you are biologically immortal and immune to aging."
talent,Dani,Rotating Doorway,,,While moving through Doors of Darkness you may take a willing adjacent ally as part of your movement.
talent,Dani,Shadow Realm Graduate,,,"Due to your years of study of the magical essence of the Shadow Realm and its inhabitants you have built up a resistance to the corruptive and damaging effects drawn from it. All Shadow Realm effects/damage only work half as well against you if you wish, regardless of if it is damaging or not. (Ex. Chaotic Cacophony would only summon a 6 Stamina Dani as opposed to 12.)"
passive,Dani,Shadow of the Soul,,,"They say the eyes are the window to the soul. “They” are wrong. The shadow is infinitesimally better than a window, it’s a door created by the darkness of their heart blocking the light of the world. As a free action you may mark any target of a successful attack or ability of yours as a Door Of Darkness which you may open and move through with your move action, open doors remain open until they are gotten rid of. You may have a max of 3 of these doors at a time. Additionally, when targeting someone you have already marked, if you have not used their door to move yet you may store one Shade (as specified in Shade Essence) in their shadow for when you do end up finally opening their door and they come out with you. (14) Increase two of your shades' stats by one each or raise the max limit to 4 via your ability (2 stats: +1 weapon range, +1 movement). (24) You may mark one ally with a door at the start of combat. (30) Increase your Door Maximum to 4. (35) You may choose to take damage for your shades and vice versa. If a shade takes damage for you any damage over its full stamina is still taken by you. (74) *teleports behind you*  - If you move to be behind a target with a Door of Darkness your dagger deals double damage/ against them that turn."
ability,Dani,Shade Essence,1,,"By allowing slivers of your own shadow to break free creating a 3 stamina Shade that has 3 movement and a 3 damage melee attack. Shades can move through your Doors of Darkness if you wish. You can summon a Max of 3 with this ability. They do not despawn after combat as they are a part of Dani's shadow, and earn prof for Dani if they crit. (14) Increase two of your shades' stats by one each or raise the max limit to 4 via your ability (2 stats: +1 weapon range, +1 movement). (45) Your Shade limit is now 5. (59) You now summon 1d4 shades when using Shade Essence normally. (80) Shade Essence is a once per round bonus action. (87) (Shade limit is now 10)."
ability,Dani,"I am a Shadow, the True Self",3,,"By fragmenting the shadow of an adjacent target and incorporating it into your own you can truly understand them, this deals 4 damage to the target (even if they're an ally) and gives you a bonus. If an ally, you have advantage on dual techs and rolls to protect them. If an enemy, they have a passive -3 to hit you and you deal an additional 3 damage on attacks against them."
ability,Dani,When One Door Closes,1!,,"If you would be attacked by someone with an Open Door Of Darkness you may willingly sever that door and immediately get one free teleport through their door as it closes to get out of the attack. Once per round. (17) Another One Opens - You may use ""When One Door Closes"" on an unopened door to dodge, opening it in the process. This does not count as ""affecting them"" in terms of gaining another shade."
ability,Dani,But a Silhouette,2,,"You may obscure yourself or something you touch with a layer of shadow which emanates from their entire form making it hard to tell where they end and the darkness actually begins. Actions to interact with this have an increased fail chance of +2, costs one upkeep per round to maintain. You may have however many things affected by this that you want as long as you pay the upkeep. You may also double/triple/etc layer if you wish as long as you pay upkeep for each layer. (64) Adding another layer of shadow to something already affected by But A Silhouette is a free action, additionally you may willingly dissipate 3 slots worth (they do not have to be shades that actively count against your limit, just that level of value total) of Shades to treat it as an anytime action once per round. You can expend One more shade per space required to do it anywhere as opposed to range of touch."
ability,Dani,Tether to Life,1,,"The shadow is a physical essence that ties you to the realm of the living, with this ability you can force someone to stay there. Create a spike made of shadow within 3 spaces that pins a target’s shadow in place making it so they cannot leave more than 3 spaces from their current position. Enough brute force can override this but it is difficult unless they just get rid of their shadow. (RIDBI) - Cannot leave more than 2 spaces from their current position, and deals 1 to them upon use and on their turns as long as the spike remains."
ability,Dani,Shadowcraft,2,,"As a woman of a high work ethic you have an important job to do, and any job worth its salt also has tools of its trade. Thankfully your job is equipped with both the tool and study of interest rolled up into one. You may create shadowy constructs of any item that you so wish. You may expend shades to reduce the stamina cost by one for each to a minimum of 0 and/or to reduce the action this takes. (i.e. 1 shade can make it a move action to use or a 1 cost, 2 could make it a free action or a 1 cost move action, etc) If you make it a free action you can only use it once that turn, unless you make it a free action again, this can happen up to 3 times per turn."
ability,Dani,Betting on the Dark Horse,3,,"While Dani might abhor people partaking of the energies and corruption of the Shadow Realm like it means nothing due to the dangers it presents to proper magic and the general public she has resigned herself that fools shall always exist and so she might as well take advantage of it. Dani may spend shades to give a target of her choice influence of the shadows as though she were their Patron. The more shades that are spent the stronger the effect, if at least three are spent then the target is treated as applicable for your damage splitting effect or anything similar. If they use their shadow powers you may choose whether or not it afflicts a door to anyone affected. She may use this on a “Regular” shade to influence it into a different entity as if it were under the effect of Blackened Soul (without actually using its once per session effect) but may only do that once per combat. Similarly, if at least 8 shades are spent on this to affect a normal person you may use Blackened Soul without them being knocked unconscious or taking maximum stamina damage and if you do, the implementation of them having shadow manipulation is permanent. Using this on a person already heavily exposed to Shadow Realm energies (or a regular shade) it only requires a minimum of 5 before being applicable."
weapon,Adhan,Fan the Hand,,,"Adhan deftly throws a number of cards at his targets with deadly accuracy and precision. This deals 3 damage at 5 range, and the damage can be divided up as desired among multiple targets or multi-hit the same target(s). Adhan may also discard cards from his hand, forgoing their normal effects unless related to Fan the Hand or being discarded, to add damage to Adhan’s current attack at an equal exchange rate (1 card discarded = +1 damage). The number of cards being discarded into Fan the Hand, along with which cards, must be decided before rolling."
weapon,Adhan,Plan B,,,Always carry a knife. 3 damage in melee. Can be thrown 3 spaces away for 2 damage.
passive,Adhan,Heart of the Cards,,,"A leather-bound card holder that is impossible to separate from Adhan, being the current subject of the Heart of the Cards. Deck of Possibilities - At the start of Adhan’s turn, he draws a card from his deck, corresponding to his weapons and abilities (roll a 1dX and draw the corresponding card from his deck list). This occurs even if he can’t physically draw his card. He can give away cards or discard them on his turn. He has a maximum hand size of 5 cards, discarding down to 5 at the end of his turn. When using a card, there is neither a stamina cost nor does it count as using the ability itself (for things like cooldowns and once per rounds/combats/etcs). It still must be used with the appropriate action. Regardless of success or failure, the card is used up. Card Collection - Should Adhan come across any interesting cards during his adventures, he can add them to his collection. They are converted into a useable format, or otherwise default into becoming a 1 damage 5 range throwing card if there is no good conversion. As Adhan has no way of selecting which cards he does and does not want to be active as of now, all new cards go into his deck. The deck has no max size. Owner-Bound - Adhan’s Heart of the Cards artifact and any cards he has, both in the card holder and those drawn, are theft proof. If this passive is disabled, Adhan keeps all cards already drawn and can still use them, but becomes unable to draw further cards."
ability,Adhan,Trap Card: Rib Cage ,2!,,"Adhan causes rib bones to spring out of any surface for a variety of applications. They can form around someone as a shield, grapple/cage someone to keep them from moving, or even just serve as a barrier. The Rib Cage persists in the space it’s created as if it isn’t destroyed or willed away by Adhan. Once per Round."
ability,Adhan,Equip Card: Ivory Armory,2,,"Summon tools, weapons, and/or armor for a target. They are made of bones, but these bones are sturdier than normal and can be shaped into any form desired."
ability,Adhan,Skill Card: Tumbleweed,1!,,"The Western favorite, an action that lets him combat roll a few spaces. He can use the roll to move out of a weapon’s range, get behind cover, dodge an attack, or just move around a little more. Once per Round."
ability,Adhan,Spell Card: Bone Shape,3,,Create something from bone and bones in a large area. May be used as a means of destruction or creation. The bones stay around until they are shattered or until Adhan wills them away.
ability,Adhan,Monster Cards: Skeleton Gang Series,3,,"Summons a specific Skeleton Gang Member to your aid. Each may be summoned only once per combat (except Blanky). Each has 5 stamina, 6 movement, the Skeleton Gang Member talent, the Gang Up and Distraction passives, and a 1 damage 1 range basic attack. These skeletons, upon reaching 0 stamina, fall into a pile of bones (effectively unconscious) that act as difficult terrain. They are fully destroyed at -5 stamina. Each different type of skeleton has some unique variations. Currently summonable: Blanky, Neighy, Shooty, Casty, Healy."
talent,Decca,[Probably? Unkillable?],,,"Decca, being a gremlin, often does extremely stupid things. However, due to how...odd...he is, these stupid things will never have any negative effect on him and he can often do things like drink poison or throw himself in front of a car without taking any self damage. If he does ‘harm’ himself a significant amount, he can roll to feign death or unconsciousness once per combat. Any action he takes upon coming out of the faked death is made with advantage due to him having the element of surprise. [29] (Talent Upgrade) Lrukinf - Decca’s so fucking unpredictable that it’s literally impossible to tell if he’s dead or not and frankly it’s disturbing. Decca may now feign death from being knocked out as well, rolling privately and telling another player their roll to determine whether or not they’re pretending to be down or if they’re actually down. If they ARE faking it, their stamina is at whatever it was at before being knocked out. Decca can additionally now fake his death up to twice per combat and he can perform VERY minor actions, like grabbing a rock that’s a space away or eating some floor food, once per turn while he is pretending to be dead without being discovered."
talent,Decca,You Better Not Do Something Dumb,,,"Words most people often say just seconds before Decca does something dumb. Decca gains a +3 on rolls he takes if he does something REALLY stupid. This means something like eating rocks to make yourself heavier so you can fall on people and do damage or lighting yourself on fire to get rid of a debuff or something but doesn’t allow Decca to do something he wouldn’t normally be capable of doing. [24] Attention Everyone, I’m About To Do Something Stupid. - On his turn, if Decca’s player comes up with a dumb idea and prefaces what he’s about to say with any variation of ‘this is probably stupid, but--,’ his action will have a +5 and will inexplicably affect basically everyone within 5 spaces of him but leave him totally unharmed. This is usually something like ‘I’m going to eat a rock from this wall, causing this room to cave in’ and not ‘I’m going to use my sword to cut a molecule in half to cause a nuclear explosion.’ Decca can also attempt to do something stupid as an anytime once per round without any bonuses."
passive,Decca,MONEY TIME MONEY TIME MONEY TIME,,,"Ooga booga kobold brain like money, money good. Money so good in fact, when Kobold get money, Kobold do better. For every amount of money Decca is given that adds up to at least 5 dollars, he gains a +1 to rolls for until the hour passes. The money must be given from another person to get the full benefit, but if he finds money on the floor or something he can gain up to a +3 this way. Items of monetary value also trigger this. Additionally, Decca has modified the Plutus Pathfinder to also be used to find valuable non-knack things! If used in this manner, it only has a cooldown of 15 real-life minutes because it’s for a lesser purpose than usual."
passive,Decca,Cringe-Ass Knick-Knack Kobold,,,Decca has already SOMEHOW fucked up 1d4 somethings on the battlefield just by being on it. This can be something like accidentally breaking a pipeline so it’s fit to burst if attacked or even somehow fucking up a big machine to make it malfunction in some ways. If Decca tries to use this fucked up stuff as part of an action he gains advantage on doing so.
passive,Decca,[Screaming Begins Again],,,"The more Decca is fucked with by someone, the more he just gets really really perturbed by them. Every time Decca is attacked or negatively affected, has his Knacks fucked with, or is otherwise antagonized by someone or something, the antagonizer gain a stack of [Screaming Begins Again]. Every stack they have, up to a max of 3, increases Decca’s crit range against them by 1, including his crit fail range. At maximum, the crit range increase becomes natural. All stacks are used up once Decca critically succeeds on hitting the target."
passive,Numa Numa No Mi,Endless Swamp,,,"As a move action you can, instead of actually moving, drag any adjacent items and/or people into your own body before reforming. As a once per turn free action you can retrieve an item stored in your body this way."

ability,Decca,I’VE SNUCK UP ON YOU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,2,,"Decca shouts the name of this ability really loudly before bodily yeeting himself at an enemy within 4 spaces. He grabs onto them, latching himself around their neck or onto their back or something, before starting to go ham. Decca cannot be removed by any means without the enemy using their main action to focus specifically on removing him from themselves, even following the enemy if they teleport. This action must be rolled for. While Decca is latched on in this way, all of his actions against them are 1.5x effective and have a natural +1 on the roll, which can get him prof. Decca can only use this ability out of a faked death, but if he fails the roll he may try it again outside of that once per combat."
ability,Decca,NYEH!,X,,"You receive an ability with two variants! Bonus Action - Decca haphazardly pulls out a random non-permakept knack or item and throws it at an enemy, applying a stronger and offensive version of it’s effects onto them! They will usually take 4-7 damage at base due to having something thrown at them though. Decca will need to retrieve their item whenever possible though, because they just...threw it. This is a 1 cost. Full-Round Action (NY-NY-NYEH!!) - Decca rummages through his...self...and pulls out any amount of non-permakept knacks or items and does stuff! For knacks, he throws them wildly up into the air, with them soon after landing in an area up to 4 spaces away from him! This area’s dimensions are XxX, with X being how many knacks he is throwing(which is also the cost, conveniently enough!) In this area, everyone within takes a big powerful combination of all of the Knack’s effects, along with 3 damage per knack! For items, he can instead choose to use the items effects from his own position in the area of choice, applied among the people already taking damage from knacks! Examples of this include shooting people with a fucking chaingun or something while they’re being pelted by knacks."

weapon,Magnolia,Flamescatter Lance ,,,"A huge lance that serves as Magnolia’s magical girl staff, and primary weapon.  It’s covered in brilliant orange jewels. Deals 5 damage up to 2 spaces away.  Alternatively, Magnolia can yeet the lance as far as she wants, dealing 3 damage at infinite range - however, each space she throws it beyond 5 spaces will give a -2 penalty to the roll.  The lance then teleports back to her hand. (14) +1 damage to Flamescatter Lance (5 to 6, 3 to 4) and it now optionally deals minor knockback and heals Magnolia for 2 Stamina on a successful hit. Searing Whirlwind (2!) - By spending 3 Pain Points, Magnolia can use this weapon attack as an anytime action after dealing damage with her Flamescatter Lance in melee range.  Magnolia swings her staff in a wide, fiery arc, dealing 3 damage to all enemies adjacent to her and setting them on fire on high rolls, dealing additional damage.  Each adjacent space to her that is empty of targets when she uses this will have a Needle Nest placed in it. Vile Finale (3!) - By spending 5 Pain Points, Magnolia can use this weapon attack as an anytime action after dealing damage with her Searing Whirlwind.  She suddenly sprints up to 12 spaces in a straight line towards a target and attempts to impale them with her lance.  This deals 4 damage, heals her for 2 Stamina, and restrains the target, as she holds them up in the air while they’re still impaled.  They can make a roll on each of their turns to escape.  Each empty space she passes through on her way to the target will have a Needle Nest placed in it.  Once per combat."
weapon,Magnolia,Feed Daga Jodida,,,"A small blade made of a massive tooth with a rune meaning “feed” carved in it, the handle's grip is wrapped in feathers. Serving as Magnolia’s offhand weapon, it deals 4 damage at 1 range. Half lifesteal, but on rolls of 17+ it has full lifesteal. It can gain new mechanics and become restylized over time (such as when thematically appropriate and especially if prof is spent to develop it) to be more in line with her capabilities."
talent,Magnolia,A Sharp Outfit,,,"When someone damages Magnolia with a melee attack, she can make a contesting roll.  If she rolls higher than them, she takes reduced damage, and half of the damage they originally would have dealt to her is reflected back at them (minimum of 1, rounded down). This counts as her needles."
passive,Magnolia,Orchestra of Agony,,,"Every little shriek and shudder makes Magnolia’s spine tingle.  Her red stat is ‘Pain Points’.  Whenever she inflicts direct damage with an attack or an ability, she gains 1 Pain Point, and whenever someone takes damage from her needles that was not the result of a direct attack, she gains 3.  Pain Points act as a secondary resource that allows Magnolia to use enhanced versions of her attacks and abilities and create combos with them.  These enhanced attacks will cost additional Stamina to use in addition to the Pain Points. In addition, many of her attacks or abilities also scatter “Needle Nests” around the battlefield.  Unless mentioned otherwise, Needle Nests deal 1 damage to anyone who passes through them (except Magnolia), at which point they vanish.  Airborne enemies are still affected - the needles hover in the air as well.  Needle Nests can never be stacked on top of each other. Red Symphony - Magnolia now gains 1 Pain Point whenever anyone takes 7 or more damage from any source. This can only occur once per turn. At The Princess’ Command - On Magnolia’s turn, she can move each of her Needle Nests one space as a bonus action. She can also move them further if she spends 1 Pain Point per two spaces of movement, which she can split between nests as she wishes. If she moves a Needle Nest intentionally into someone, she will only gain 1 Pain Point instead of 3. (25) Hmm… Might As Well Give It A Try…~ - Magnolia has figured out how to unify her sadism with her epithet. When she deals damage to any target that contains blood, the needles infuse the blood with the pain they’ve inflicted, and in turn draw the blood into themselves and store it. Just a little taste couldn’t hurt... Magnolia can now spend Pain Points at any time to heal herself for 3 Stamina per point. However, after spending a total of 8 points in this way during the same combat, it begins healing her for 0.5 Stamina per point. Death By Inches - ‘Needle Nests’ bypass all forms of DR and defensive effects, and can even damage normally intangible targets like ghosts or shades."
ability,Magnolia,Throne of Thorns,2,,"The skies fill with darkness as a gigantic throne made of needles emerges from the ground beneath Magnolia, lifting her 4 spaces off the ground, with the throne resting on a giant pillar made of needles, all pointing directly outwards.  The pillar deals 2 damage to all adjacent targets when it emerges, and is nearly impossible to climb without taking more damage.  Every space adjacent to the throne also has a Needle Nest placed in it.  The throne lasts until the end of Magnolia’s next turn, at which point it shrinks back to the ground unless she spends 2 Pain Points to keep it active.  She cannot place thrones on top of each other.  If she uses this ability in the area created by Forest of Steel, the roll has advantage. (19) Throne Of Thorns can now be used as a bonus action by spending 2 Pain Points or spending 4 Stamina. Queen of Pain (1!) - By spending 3 Pain Points, Magnolia can use this ability as an anytime action while she’s sitting on the Throne of Thorns.  She can place 3 Needle Nests anywhere she wants on the battlefield, including right underneath an opponent, but doing so counts as dealing direct damage, and they can roll to hop out of the way.  Once per round. Regicide (2!) - Once per combat, while Magnolia is sitting in the throne, she can spend 5 Pain Points and cause the pillar to collapse in a cardinal direction, dealing 5 damage to each target in a 4 space line in the collapsed direction.  Needle Nests are created in unoccupied spaces in the line."
ability,Magnolia,Leave You in Stitches,1!,,"Magnolia targets two enemies within 4 spaces of her and throws a needle at each of them with a long, crimson thread attached.  In nearly an instant, Magnolia manipulates the needles and sews the two targets’ clothes together, dealing 1 damage to each of them and pulling them together so that they’re standing adjacent.  They cannot move away from each other while trapped by the stitches, and each of their movements are halved on their turns.  At any time while the targets are restrained, by spending 2 Pain Points, Magnolia can give herself a +3 bonus to any attack or ability she uses on the restrained targets.  Once per round. (29) Always Ready For Fun - Magnolia no longer has to spend Pain Points to get a roll bonus against targets restrained by ‘Leave You In Stitches’ or ‘Katamari Denasty’. Katamari Denasty (3!) - Aww, doesn’t it look like those two are having fun?  Why don’t MORE OF YOU join in!?  By spending 5 Pain Points, instead of using ‘Leave You In Stitches’, Magnolia can use this ability instead.  It has the same effects, except it can target 4 enemies within 6 spaces of her instead.  On lower rolls, enemies might still be pulled in part of the way, but they aren’t restrained unless they end up adjacent to each other. (29) Always Ready For Fun - Magnolia no longer has to spend Pain Points to get a roll bonus against targets restrained by ‘Leave You In Stitches’ or ‘Katamari Denasty’."
ability,Magnolia,Reap What I've Sewn,1,,"Okay but let’s be serious for a second; Magnolia’s actually really good at knitting.  She can craft together fashion masterpieces in a matter of moments and then give them to an ally within 3 spaces.  This clothing can have a wide variety of effects depending on the roll and Magnolia’s specifications, but usually it will make the ally more defensive in some way, or offer some small utility buff.  By spending 3 Pain Points, Magnolia can use this ability as a bonus action on her turn. Patch Job (1!) - Once per round, by spending 1 Pain Point, Magnolia can attempt to repair or enhance one of the outfits she created with ‘Reap What I’ve Sewn’."
ability,Magnolia,Anti Acupuncture,2,,"Magnolia aims for a vulnerable part of a target’s body and expertly aims her needles to debilitate them the most.  Magnolia throws needles at a target within 3 spaces with extreme precision, while also choosing what part of their body she’s aiming for.  Depending on what she aims at, the target is debuffed in some way.  For example, if she aims at their legs, their movement could be reduced, or if she aims at their eyes, they’re temporarily blinded and have a debuff to their rolls. The target also takes 6 damage. Rage Chakra (2!) - By spending 2 Pain Points, Magnolia can use this ability to stab herself with needles immediately after using ‘Anti Acupuncture’ on an opponent.  But in her case, it heals her for 5 Stamina and strengthens her, giving her next roll a +5 bonus and granting her immunity to fire damage for 1 round, and the next time she deals damage, she heals for half of the damage dealt (minimum of 1, rounded down)."
weapon,Storm,Plasm Chainsaw,,,A giant plasma chain shoots out of an emitter on the forearm of Storm. It has an electrifying blue color. They can use this Plasma Chainsaw to deal 4 damage at 1 range and if they defeat an enemy with the chainsaw they reload all of their weapons. If Plasma Chainsaw crits you can choose one specific gun to give an extra use to.

talent,Storm,Gun Tinkerer,,,Storm is low key a giant nerd when it comes to guns. They believe that everyone has a special kind of gun that would suit them. Storm can observe each party member to produce a gun that has 1d6 shots per combat. The gun is uniquely made for said party members. (Is unaffected by Storm’s Reload mechanics)
talent,Storm,**GLORY**,,,"Storm loves the thrill of the fight. He especially enjoys tearing apart beings that are at death’s door. When an enemy within Storm’s aura falls below 15% of their max health Storm can perform a devastatingly brutal attack (described by Storm’s Player) that can deal a maximum of 12 damage on his turn as an unrolled main action. The damage depends on how brutal the attack is. If Storm successfully knocks out a target with this damage he can reload 2 guns of his choice. On targets with more than 100 stamina this also triggers at 45% and 75%. When using GLORY in this way, Storm can choose to reload 1 gun. Secret Mechanic: **GLORY CHAIN**- If you cause another GLORY to happen during a GLORY, you can immediately perform another GLORY."
passive,Storm,A Walking Nightmare,,,"Due to traveling *somewhere* for many many years Storm has a terrifying aura to him. The creatures from that place fear the legend known only as The Storm.  Whenever Storm uses an ability, regardless of that ability’s success, any enemy within 1 space of them are forced to use half their movement rounded down to move in a straight line directly away from Storm at the start of the enemy’s turn (Storm’s decision on direction) and they also take a fear token. At three tokens they are frozen by fear and cannot use their movement on their next turn and have disadvantage on rolls against Storm until the end of their next turn. The fear tokens then reset to 0."
passive,Storm,"""Green"" Energy",,,"It might not seem like it but Storm is in fact an individual who likes to look after the environment. He doesn’t outwardly say this but his power armor is partially powered by solar panels and the like. Recently he has upgraded these solar panels using a green crystalline substance as a base, giving him a number of different benefits when it comes to his power armor. At the start of combat (or during combat if he receives this upgrade mid combat) Storm can pick two parts of his power armor he wants to direct more power to. >Fear - Storm’s fear aura is extended an additional space and A Terrifying Gaze is now twice per round. >Weaponry - All of Storm’s energy based attacks have their damage increased by 2. (Plasm Chainsaw, Plasm Shot, Orbital Strike? BFG?) >Manufacturing - Storm can now produce 1d2 guns with Print Gun whenever he uses it as well as losing the twice per combat restriction. >Defenses - Storm gains 1 fast healing as well as an Armor Class of 6 + 1d4 that specifically defends on the natural roll of attacks directed at him. AoE abilities can bypass this Armor Class. Ties to attacker. The Armor Class rerolls at the start of Storm's turn."
ability,Storm,Menacing Reload,2,,"Storm reloads all of their guns in a very intimidating fashion. All* guns are refilled with ammo and the range from A Walking Nightmare is increased by 1 space for this ability. If Storm chooses, they can shoot one of their guns at a person with 3 fear tokens instead of making them frozen. If Menacing Reload Crits you can choose up to 3 specific guns to give an extra use to AND certain guns get to be reloaded."
ability,Storm,Print GUN,X,,"In the heat of battle Storm activates their suits 3D printer in order to produce an item that will help Storm in some way. Roll a 1d20 to determine which gun is printed. Storm’s Gun List. After a gun is printed it cannot be printed again.  For the guns that don’t have a set use number, they have 2 uses in them before they have to reload. Guns reload at the end of combat or if an enemy is defeated with the Plasma Chainsaw. Twice per combat. Storm loses all the guns 3D printed at the end of a session. Free action."
ability,Storm,A Terrifying Gaze,1!,,"After an enemy has used at least half their movement Storm gazes at them with a terrifying stare stopping them dead in their tracks instantly upping their fear token by an extra 1 token. This can also be used if an ally or Storm is being attacked to give a negative to the roll, still giving the attacking enemy a fear token."
weapon,The Conductor,Coal Engine,,,"The Conductor spits out hot fiery coals dealing 2 damage at 4 range. These coals are very hot and force the enemy out of surprise to move in a random direction roll 1d4 to determine direction. 1 = north, 2 = east, 3 = south, and 4 = west. Precision Coal Firin - Able to choose the direction an enemy is pushed in."
talent,The Conductor,Omnipresent Train,,,"If a train is heard from the real world The Conductor can manifest and deal 3 damage to a target of his choice in the combat. However this effect can only trigger if The Conductor's player is present (whether in call, or watching the twitch stream) or if a player has at least 5 companionship with The Conductor through their characters. This can only trigger once every turn and if a 20 is rolled The Conductor gains 1 prof. (Special) Blood for the Train God - The Conductor Secret Mechanic: Knockout a boss with Omnipresent Train. (Rat Every) - Whenever The Conductor would be summoned by Omnipresent Train, Once Per Combat a singular PC can offer their services to The Conductor. The PC can enter a contract with The Conductor for the remainder of the combat by sacrificing X amount of damage from their basic attack that is permanent for the combat. In turn The Conductor's Omnipresent Train damage is increased by the amount of damage sacrificed to him times 1/2 (rounding down). Each time The Conductor would appear the damage is taken away from the target's basic attack. Each time being a permanent reduction for the combat. When the target's basic attack begins to go below 0, 1.5X stamina (rounding up) is required when The Conductor is summoned. However The Conductor gets the full amount of damage when it gets to this state."
talent,The Conductor,Satan's Train,,,"The Conductor has seen many many different hells. When 3 6s are rolled cumulatively in a combat that The Conductor is a PC in, there might have happened to be a stowaway from one of the many hells in the DBA universe. At this moment in particular they happen to hop out and add an effect to a target of their choosing. They then disappear into the material plane. Who knows if they’ll show up again. (29) Multiplanar Stowaways - It seems as tho word has gotten around that the Conductor is stoppin by the material plane. Multiple different types of individuals from multiple different types of planes happen to be stowing away but only a couple are lucky enough to actually jump off at the material plane. The Conductor can choose 4 planes from this list of planes of existence to have beings from there that are able to hop off. Depending on the plane of existence chosen the required number may be secret but all the effects are secret."
passive,The Conductor,Manifest Destiny,,,"Instead of taking over the entire world, The Conductor likes to have control over the battlefield. The Conductor leaves behind train tracks wherever they move. When The Conductor moves back on the tracks they are considered to have double movement. Tracks are unable to be side by side with each other. The Conductor can still  move in these spaces but is unable to place tracks. When The Conductor also moves he seems to have a couple train cars in tow behind him for his passengers or for supplies. The train cars disappear at the end of his turn. Multi-Track Drifting - The Conductor now has triple movement when moving on his placed tracks. Tracks can now be placed right next to each other. Treat The Conductor as taking up 2 spaces when on tracks right next to each other. 3D Track Drifting - The Conductor is now able to drive his train in a 3-dimensional manner. However if he takes an action other than movement (or a movement-based action) while driving in the 3rd dimension he begins to fall. Yes tracks are placed in the air. Allies are unable to ride on these tracks however."
passive,The Conductor,"Trainsformers, More than Meets the Eye",,,The Conductor can on his turn give up placing down tracks to morph into a different vehicle of sorts. The vehicle still has a smoke stack and all the aesthetics of The Conductor while they are a train but now they are a different vehicle. This provides a passive buff or ability for the round that pertains to that vehicle; the buff/ability is decided by an agreement of the player and the GM. This can only trigger every other turn of The Conductor’s.
ability,The Conductor,What Does the Wells Fargo(TM) Train Have for You?,X,,The Conductor moves their movement on the tracks delivering helpful supplies and tools to their allies. These items can be anything ranging from healing food or weapons! X is decided by the GM and is determined by what is delivered.
ability,The Conductor,RAMMING SPEED,Y,,When this ability is activated The Conductor’s movement is now considered tripled their base movement while on the track. (quadrupled if they have the track drifter talent) until the start of their next turn. They deal X amount to a target that is within their movement. X is the number of spaces traveled on the track. Y is ¼ of the damage dealt rounding up.
ability,The Conductor,Everyone Can be a Train if They Believe Hard Enough!,2!,,"The Conductor inspires an ally that is on the track with TRAIN ENERGY. The ally now benefits from Manifest Destiny. This means they can build a track and have double movement if they move on the tracks. Lasts for the target's turn.

ability,The Conductor,4D Track Drifting,X,,"By spending his *entire movement action*, The Conductor is able to visit a map within the roll20 that people wouldn’t mind The Conductor visiting and retrieve an item from said map. X is dependent on what the item is. If The Conductor would be visiting a map that he has been to himself (such as with Omnipresent Train),  the cost of the ability is reduced by 2 to a minimum of 1."

weapon,Iradia,Petal Slice,,,"All of Iradia’s petals shift to her back onto the metal structure she calls a Coravain. They all combine, forming a beautiful pattern, and Iradia throws the Coravain full force at a target, before returning to her. It’s as much skill as it is a manipulation of the petals. This deals 3 damage at 4 range. Upon getting a crit, she gains 2 proficiency and deals X3 damage instead of the usual X2."
weapon,Iradia,Shattered Garden,,,"The proper name for the weapon that Iradia wields, the petals begetting other petals and ability to manipulate them comes from the Shattered Garden. While she’s used to attacking with her Coravain, she can still attack with the Shattered Garden purely. Usually, 2 damage, 5 range."
talent,Iradia,OH WE’RE BRINGING FASHION INTO THIS?,,,"Iradia almost always looks positively wonderful. You may be able to gather by her general appearance, but she absolutely LOVES fashion, makeup, clothing and knitting, she keeps several cases of related products on her at all times. She may take these cases out for materials whenever she desires, and rolls double advantage for spiffing someone up in some way. This can optionally be used for more...nefarious purposes."
passive,Iradia,Beauty Begets Beauty,,,"Iradia has various large glass petals surrounding them at all times, interwoven like a beautiful piece of art. Their Petals substitute their proficiency stat. At any point in time they may Obliterate the petals for upgrades, 4 for an ability and 2 for a passive or upgrade. They may use additional petals to be more exact with both what they get and the power level of the upgrade. More petals also makes everything they do more powerful. They gain 1.5X proficiency, and gain proficiency from anything relating to their petals. She may Obliterate the petals at any time, and people may steal them for proficiency or destroy them to weaken her. Iradia does not gain standard upgrades, but does get one for keeping petals at every interval of 10, and classes up upon gaining (not keeping) a total of 60 and 100 petals respectively. Classing up gives the same benefits it would usually."
ability,Iradia,Interlocking Garden,2,,"Iradia grabs someone and picks them up as the petals all stab into the target, around 6 damage depending on the amount of petals, as well as gaining 2 temporary petals that last for 2 rounds. These petals cannot be obliterated. She then throws the target (with the help of her petals) up to 3 spaces away. Once per Combat, Iradia can add Petals permanently to her entourage equal to the targets proficiency, divided by 200, rounded down."
ability,Iradia,The Radiant Bridge,2,,"Iradia jumps up and outstretches her petals, creating a construct from them all. The more petals she has, the larger, more complex and resilient the structure can be. The structure can defy gravity."
ability,Iradia,Opal Obliteration,3,,"Iradia manipulates the petals into a massive cannon, creating a weapon out of all of them, optionally blasting light into the crafted weapon, with the various petals increasing the powers depending on the colour and construct of the focus.  The range, area, damage, elemental, and whether or not it is a Once per Combat are all dependant on what she creates."

ability,Gendro,My Copy Right,3,,"Gendro gains an intellectual monopoly over a concept by patenting it. From then on, if that action is performed, they have to either give 1 stamina to Gendro for him to heal from, or take 2 damage while Gendro doesn’t heal. He can only have one of these active at a time and the GM can rule against him being able to patent things like breathing or walking. If he wants to make another, the first is disabled."
ability,Gendro,Start Up Loan,2,,"Gendro gives an ally a loan of stamina (which is the stamina cost), letting them heal for 3 stamina. After that, every time they perform an ability successfully, they heal 1 stamina. Keep track of this stamina however, as Gendro can as an anytime bonus action suddenly take all of the money this startup generated, transferring all the stamina healed over to himself as his own healing. The ally will still be gaining stamina when they use abilities. If desired, Gendro can use this multiple times on the same ally to apply more and more stacks of healing after successful ability usage."
ability,Gendro,It Fixes Problems,0!,,"Gendro can spend red stat equal to half the amount of damage he or an ally would take from an incoming attack rounded down to pay off the attack, deleting its effects."
weapon,Gargoyle,Stare,,,"(8 damage 2 range) A fuck-off sized blade that could be mistaken for a slab of metal on a stick. It takes a turn for the attack to occur, but from the beginning to the end of his swing he takes half damage rounded down and no other undesired effects (status, token, marker, and so on). In addition, it cannot be ceased or interacted with once in motion. Alternatively, Gargoyle may use this to protect himself for up to the total amount of damage an attack with this weapon could deal, which lasts until his next turn begins."
talent,Gargoyle,Lockdown,,,"Due to the side-effects of his epithet, Gargoyle does not get to move very easily. He cannot be moved or knocked around (including being knocked prone), his movement cannot be increased, decreased, or removed, and he remains where he is no matter the conditions around him (including if the floor is removed). Note that these effects occur whether he is willing or unwilling. He is also very good at stealth, due to his lack of unnecessary noise and motion."
passive,Gargoyle,"I’m Holding, That’s What I Do",,,"All actions Gargoyle can take can be performed anywhere from the start of his turn to just before his next turn. They are treated as if they were held actions, with the priority that held actions have. If Gargoyle intentionally holds an action during his actual turn, all rolls related to it roll with advantage."
ability,Gargoyle,Delayed Slash,,,"Gargoyle makes an attack with Stare. If he chooses to ignore the windup half the damage occurs now and the other half is set aside. If he chooses to include the windup, he can set aside up to all of the damage. Every time it becomes his turn, all stored slashes have their damage increased by 1. This continues until Gargoyle releases the damage. If Gargoyle is knocked out or worse, all stored slashes immediately trigger."
ability,Gargoyle,Give it a Minute,2!,,"Gargoyle focuses, and the action the target is taking becomes delayed. Once per round. Instant Delay - This gives enough time to block, dodge, or avoid the action. Extended Delay - One round later from when this ability is used, the action goes through as usual (including any efforts to interact with it). This ability is just rolling to work, not to beat the enemy. Higher rolls delay the action further, while lower rolls shorten how long the wait will be. The target may move around and act as per usual, but the action is still considered used until the delay is over (still paying the costs, preventing anytimes from recharging, and that specific action from being taken again). (A natural 20 might mean Gargoyle chooses when it activates)"
ability,Gargoyle,"A Moment, if You Would",3!,,"Gargoyle suddenly pauses existence, allowing him to take a non-ability action before unpausing and allowing everything to continue. The roll for this is whether or not he gets to take his action before someone may complete theirs, not to directly beat someone’s roll. And, he must roll for the action he’s taking if applicable. However, this action may be used in the middle of other actions to affect the outcome."
weapon,Dellanora,Record Scratch,,,"The perfect tool for a musical performance on the go, armored finger claws that can bring out the greatest screech out of a sound board. Capable of switching between three different variations of itself: Regal Record [A-Side]: Sound from the Soundboard that deals 3 Damage at 4 Range. Regal Record [B-Side]: Sound from the Soundboard attuned with Dellanora’s Epithet that deals 1.5 times the effect of her current Track within the aura’s Range. Scratch Strum: Armored Claw that deals 5 Damage at 1 Range. (24) Scratch Strum may now apply a debuff based on Della’s current Track."
talent,Dellanora,Natural Rhythym,,,"Who knew that such inspiration was hiding amidst violence, you just gotta play to your heart’s content. Whenever an ally or enemy rolls a natural 20 with an ability, Dellanora can immediately use a 1-cost anytime to improve or worsen their success based on one of the abilities in her kit. If this rolls a 15 or above, she can add a new Track flavored after their Critical Success Theme. (Secret Mechanic) Whenever Della crits on Natural Rhythm, the track acquired from that is not limited to being applicable to only allies or enemies. It may be selected targeting. It’s also boosted!"
passive,Dellanora,Welcome to My Center Stage,,,"Any audience captivated by Della’s fashion and music is one worth playing to, as she responds to their attention with a track that matches the scene. In other words, Della emits an aura with a radius of 3 squares (15 feet) in which she can play one of the following Tracks. A Track may be selected at the beginning of combat, they can be switched during the start of Della’s turn. The effects of these Tracks only last for one round before repeating (or changing) during Della’s turn in the next round. However, these effects do not apply to allies outside of the aura and do not passively apply to Della. (Secret Mechanic) - When Dellanora gets another Track from the same person, she must choose which version of that Track to bring for a combat / bounty. (18) Expert of the Audience - Not feeling the vibes of what you’re listening to anymore? Well then it’s time to change it up. Della intuitively knows what any gathering of people desire, and as such, she can now switch her current Track for another one in her collection once between her turns. Tracks switched this way have all bonuses moved to the new track. However, this does not automatically trigger any Tracks with healing effects like Medical Melody, but it would replace any effects lost on allies through Let Them See and Hear You with the newly selected Track's effect. While on Della’s turn, she may separately trigger this talent to exchange her movement action to swap any two targets’ places that are within her aura (unwilling targets may roll to resist if they’re selected). (27) Humming Along - Behind everyone’s chattering, and possible fighting, the world is playing its own song. Instead of switching to one of your currently available Tracks, you can instead use the BGM to create an effect befitting the current scenario."
ability,Dellanora,Sounds Like You Need Some Coordination,2!,,"This audience needs a bit of fine tuning to get what they want done right, and you can give them that tune. If an ally were to fail a roll within Della’s aura, she may attempt to give them a reroll to have a better chance at success. Additionally, if her roll were to be a 15 or above, that ally may reroll with a bonus equal to the current amount of allies in Della’s aura. Once per Round. (21) Sounds Like You Need Some Coordination can now be used on Della’s own roll, in addition it is now Twice per Round."
ability,Dellanora,Let Them See and Hear You,3!,,"The audience is here to cheer us on darling, so show them what you do best. Out of everyone within Della’s aura, she can focus the spotlight on one of them. Depending on who she picks, one of the following effects will happen: Della - If she picks herself, she’ll actually receive the collective benefits of her active Track (current effect multiplied by the number of allies within her aura). However, the boosted effect for the spolighted person stops when it's used once and all allies will only have half the effect of this Track for the rest of the round. An Ally - If she picks an ally, they will receive the collective benefits of her active Track (current effect multiplied by the number of allies within her aura). However, the boosted effect for the spolighted person stops when it's used once and all allies will only have half the effect of this Track for the rest of the round. An Enemy - If she picks an enemy, the collective benefits of her active Track would be turned into a detriment for said enemy (opposite of current effect multiplied by the number of allies within her aura). However, the boosted effect for the spolighted person stops when it's used once and all allies will only have half the effect of this Track for the rest of the round. Note: If Medical Melody is the current Track, it cannot be used on an Enemy, but it can still be used on Della or an Ally for a collective healing effect. This is the same for any other healing-based Tracks. Note: If Della has any Tracks that are detrimental to enemies, they are applied appropriately no matter who is picked. Once Per Round. (Secret Mechanic) Your allies now only lose half the effects of the track rounded down when you use spotlight."
ability,Dellanora,Keep Your Eyes and Ears on Me,2,,"If the audience can’t hear you, just keep raising the volume til they can’t stop hearing anything but you. If Della were to concentrate on her epithet for a moment, she can either increase the radius of her aura by 1 square (5 feet) or boost the effectiveness of her current Track by 1 (this boost is lost if she changes Tracks)."
ability,Dellanora,Brace Yourself With Some Lo-Fi Beats,2!,,"Let yourself get lost within the audience through the groove coming to you. Della can pick anyone within her aura, including herself, to receive protection from a sound barrier created through her Epithet. This reduces damage by her aura’s range plus the current Track’s effect number (if the Track has no actual numeric value, it defaults to 2).

Range is unlimited so long as they can hear Dad, inability to hear him means they can’t be affected. You don’t have to roll for this ability, instead relying on the recipient’s honest judgement of the joke, though you may still roll for it if you wish. High rolls or particularly amazing/terrible jokes may cause fitting status effects, a crit guarantees one. The amount the joke damages or heals depends on how bad/good it is.

passive,Perla,The Future Is Now,,,"Perla has a direct line of contact directly with fate itself… through their epithet fax machine. At the start of combat, she is sent a vague cryptic prophecy of things to come, determined by the GM. While how they are interpreted can be a little variant, the events in this are guaranteed to happen… and they aren’t always very beneficial. In fact, at least one of the predictions is guaranteed to involve something horrible happening to her. Unfortunately Perla can’t change them either, so she and everyone else are stuck with the fate they’re given. Maybe they can prepare ahead of time to turn it towards a more favorable outcome? [7 Prof] Pick Your Poison - Once per batch Perla can choose to reroll one of her predictions. However, the reroll universally creates a more destructive result. Fate doesn’t like choosers. [32 Prof] Change The Future - Whenever Perla is able to use a future prediction against an enemy and make it in her favor (warning, not always possible for every prediction), she gains +1 max stamina. [43 Prof] I See God is Forgetful Today - Whenever the GM forgets one of your predictions and doesn’t have it occur during their active combat, you gain +1 proficiency or +1 max stamina, your choice.

ability,Perla,Pathetic Request,3,,"Send in a really overly polite and pathetically worded request through your fax machine out to the future, to please please *please* have a certain something happen.

ability,Perla,Random Transmission,3,,"Perla gets a sudden transmission from one of the only people still using a fax machine! Unfortunately Perla is pretty sure they’re doing it entirely to fuck with her specifically. Every time it’s just some random image. Luckily she can resubmit this towards an enemy or object to impart some properties of the image into it. By the way, as a passive of this ability Perla receives literally every message sent on any fax machine in the world. [15 Prof] Random Transmission now rolls two images, and you may choose which one to use for the ability! ...you still have to, like, physically keep the other one though. [25 Prof] Focused Search - Perla can use this fancy-spangled google imagers to find images with Random Transmission. However, doing so allows the GM to manipulate the resulting effect for the worse, and you still must pick the first image."
ability,Perla,NOT AGAIN!,1,,"Through some twist of fate, something horrible happens to you! However, you manage to duck out of the way just in time. This can cause whatever bad thing that would’ve happened to instead hit a nearby enemy instead! Take that, fate! Please don’t hurt me."
ability,Perla,FIXITFIXITFIXITFIXIT,0!,,"Perla quickly types in a new d20 roll for a target! However, despite her fast typing the fax machine takes way too long to submit, making it so the person is stuck with their original roll. However, their next roll they make is replaced with the roll from you! For allies the roll is equal to the d20 of this ability, and for enemies it’s equal to the inverse of the d20 for this ability. Once per round."
ability,Perla,Cyber Bullying,3⛯,,"The future isn’t the only thing you’re good at provoking! With this, Perla can send a pestering message to any one greater being, whether it be some god or archon of an aspect of the universe, or a pre-existing character. This provokes them into sending horrible terrors and catastrophes into the arena periodically for the rest of combat, flavored around their powers! Alternatively, you may message The Future to give you another prediction. If used with File For Later, the message will be perceived as from the one who triggered it, and thus the disasters will target the activator. Once per combat."

ability,Burly,Batting Arm,3,,"By transferring the strength of his bat into his arm, Burly can throw a particularly fast ball that's incredibly difficult to avoid.

They each come with their own baseball base, and are arranged in a baseball diamond shape (bases are 5 spaces to diagonal up right, then 5 up left, then 5 down left, then down right 5). They can attempt to catch and negate any enemy projectiles that pass adjacent to them, and also attack any enemies that walk within once space of them with a 4 damage baseball bat. Each goon has 5 stamina, and if they are ever commanded to, or are forcefully removed from a base, the next attack they are hit by automatically knocks them out. Once per combat."

Specifically, they get an extra movement action +2 to ram into anyone and everyone they can. However, using this reduces their movement by -2 on their next turn. This debuff stacks if this ability is used multiple turns in a row. Grand Drift - Who needs brakes when you can make seemingly impossible turns?  When using Grand Drift, the path Hot Rod takes is covered in fire."
ability,Hot Rod,Burning Rubber,2!,,"Hot Rod drags their tires deep into the ground, kicking up a massive dust cloud that can be used to blind opponents.

She can roll to siphon energy, and her basic weapon gets a +2 lifesteal Drawback: Sickly Sweet - Anyone may consume Holly’s oil for 1 Stamina. This disallows her from picking it back up, as well as dealing damage to her if consumed while attached to her body. Plus, the taste of the oil is highly addictive, and while it’s not attached to her “main body,” it only very slightly corrodes. If this talent isn’t chosen, it’s bland instead...But it smells sweet!"

ability,Holly,Oil Composition,2,,"Holly is technically made out of a viscous oily substance. Therefore, as well as health, she has a red stat called “Excess.” Excess represents how much extra oil she has. She gains Excess by eating things, absorbing things into her mass, and anything roleplay based that may increase her Excess. Excess can be used as a replacement for stamina for abilities, to regain stamina, or if a lot is gained and used, temporarily ignore a Drawback."
ability,Holly,Oily Reconstruction,2!,,"Holly forces a bit of her body outwards towards a location, able to hit someone for 2 damage within 5 range and covering the target, be it a tile on the ground or a person. As a Once per Round (0 cost) anytime, she can freely control the substance launched from this ability. Holly can reabsorb these bits that she launches out to regain the stamina. Once per Round. Drawback: Never “Together” - At the end of combat, Holly restores all but 6 stamina, has trouble going to sleep, and gains reduced health from resting or sleeping. Plus, she has a constant...feeling of being just slightly hollow."
ability,Holly,Black Lake,2,,"Holly swiftly dissolves into a 5x5 puddle, dealing 3 damage to any enemy caught in the radius. She may stay like this, morphing and shaping the oil field to her desire and being able to move it up to 3 spaces. She may also reform suddenly with a bit of velocity, rolling advantage for a surprise attack/ability, as well as dealing 2 extra damage to anyone on the “Oil mat” as it suddenly reforms. Drawback: Falling Apart - Below half health, Holly starts to drip and fall apart more and more, not quite being able to hold herself together anymore. Any movement above 3 costs 1 stamina to do, unless she can find some way to keep herself together."
ability,Holly,Puddle Creature,2,,"Holly fires out a puddle of her weird goop and snaps, giving it a limited sentience. The creature has a nerfed version of all abilities besides this one, and no basic attack. The critters have 5 health. Drawback: Freezer Burn - Holly takes 2X damage from ice/cold based attacks, and can take massive damage if shattered."
ability,Holly,Melting Pot,3,,"Holly can cover a person or an object in her oil and melt it down into the same substance as her, regaining some health and getting a property based off of the object. She also gets more of the oil, which can be used for things like a larger Puddle Creature or a larger Black Lake with more resources. Drawback: Corrupted Mind - Sometimes, Holly gets intrusive thoughts that want her to consume more and more, wishing to baptize more and more objects and people into her substance...She can brush these off...Mostly...But sometimes they get… Really bad. Upon rolling a crit fail, she suddenly gets a...Need to absorb things. People, objects, anything so long as she can get her hands on it. People can snap her out of this, or she can eat enough to satiate her hunger, but the more it happens the harder it becomes to bring her back. It only gets a bit better in between sessions, but if unlucky it gets far worse than it does better."
ability,Holly,Fragmented,1,,"Holly focuses a bunch oil to her core and explodes it outwards, dealing 4 damage to anyone adjacent and jumping 2 spaces in any direction, along with covering anyone who she jumps over with her oil. Drawback: Dissolve - Things that: Suck up/absorb liquid, Slow down liquid, Trap liquid, And other things of a similar vein, Deal actual (and often serious) damage to Holly."
ability,Holly,Bound to the Walls,3,,"Holly explodes outwards suddenly, either sending out multiple chains that deal minor damage to everyone hit and pulling them in closer, leaving the chains attached for potential follow-up attacks, or she makes herself jet around, gaining around 16 movement and dealing damage to whatever, and whoever, gets hit. Drawback: Back To The Source - If any of Holly’s oil is painfully stimulated (attacked or shocked), she takes minor damage, even if it’s no longer attached to her."
weapon,Alphonso,Whistling Rapier,,,While seemingly just a simple weapon this sword hides a special feature. Small holes hidden throughout the weapon turn the brutality of combat into a beautiful symphony. 6 damage 1 range.
talent,Alphonso,Symphony,,,"When performing a song ability such as Crescendo Forte you can choose to instead use it as a full round action. Doing this reduces the cost of the ability to 1 and the buff ends if you stop playing. At the start of your turn you can choose to continue playing your current song, switch songs, or end your song."
passive,Alphonso,Perfect Tempo,,,"Alphonso has sought perfection in every task since he was a young boy. And through persistence and great intellect he can achieve it. When Alphonso performs an action he gains a beat. He can spend 3 beats to give himself advantage on an action, spend 6 beats for double advantage, or spend 10 beats to make his next action critically succeed. (Anytimes do not count towards your beats)."
ability,Alphonso,Vivace Harmony,2,,Playing a lively tune you fill yourself and your allies with energy. Those affected by this ability gain +1 to attack rolls and +2 movement for 3 rounds. When Vivace Harmony is conducted as a symphony you may select an ally to become “First Chair”. While this song is played they gain an additional attack action. (Song)

ability,Alphonso,Battle Rando,3⛯,,"Alphonso goes into a destructive dervish; rapidly attacking a target over and over again.

Additionally, each successful attack gives Alphonso a beat. (Once Per Combat)"
ability,Alphonso,Sharp/Flat,1!,,"Usable on both allies and enemies, with a swing of his sword Alphonso makes an allies roll go up by +2, or an enemies roll go down by -2."

weapon,Zochoten,Raw Strength,,,"Zochoten’s physical form and technique are incredibly strong, allowing him to deal 5 damage at melee range. However, the more his epithet flares up the more powerful his physique gets."
talent,Zochoten,Adrenaline Reignition,,,"Once at stage 5 or greater, abilities no longer cost stamina (except for Hurts So Good)."
talent,Zochoten,Unnamed Upgrade,,,"Zochoten can now create a decent amount of more regulated heat around him. This means that anyone adjacent to him doesn’t suffer from cold terrain effects like rain and snow. Freezing of any kind begins to melt around Zochoten, disappearing after a round or so."
passive,Zochoten,OW OW FUCK FUCK OW,,,"As Zochoten takes damage, their inner spark begins to ignite, unleashing more and more potential from their epithet. Whenever they suffer damage, they gain that much red stat. Once you’ve reached or passed certain thresholds, your kit is augmented to be more powerful! Stamina costs for abilities don’t count as “taking damage” for this passive. Once your red stat is above your maximum health, you take damage equal to half of the amount of red stat above you are rounded up, and this damage does not increase your red stat. - Stage 1 (5 Damage) +1 movement, +1 damage. 1 range aura that deals 1 damage at the start of his turn to enemies within. - Stage 2 (10 Damage) +1 damage, all attacks have a fire proc chance, +3 chance to land attacks, +1 aura damage. - Stage 3 (17 Damage) +1 movement, advantage on strength checks, immunity to staggers and stuns. - Stage 4 (25 Damage) +1 damage, critical hits are exploding, +1 crit range, +1 aura range. - Stage 5+ (35 (+10) Damage) +1 damage, +1 movement, or +1 aura damage. [14 Prof] “+1 aura range” is now a potential effect of your stage 5 and ups to choose from."
ability,Zochoten,Hurts So Good,?,,"Due to the unfortunate nature of his power, Zochoten has to straight up stab himself with some sharp instruments in order to activate his epithet. Luckily he knows how to inflict the most pain onto himself while minimizing damage taken. With this he stabs himself in the arms, causing the stamina cost to be between 1-3 for this ability. He then gains red stat equal to double the cost of this ability, as if he were dealing that much self damage. Stage 1 - Your epithet momentarily flares, causing your aura to tick its damage immediately. Stage 2 - Zochoten’s epithet is leaking into the sharp objects themselves, effectively injecting more fire into himself for an additional +1 red stat gained. Stage 3 - This can be used as a once per round bonus action on your turn. Stage 4 - The sharp objects spark your arms with energy. Depending on what you flavor the object to be, your bare arm attacks gain a special effect. Stage 5+ - Increase the cap of stamina that can be spent on this at once by +1."
ability,Zochoten,"Hey, That's My Attack!",2!,,"Zochoten notices an attack coming within 2 range, and jumps into the way to take the damage instead.

ability,Zochoten,Rekindled Demon,3⛯,,"Once per combat Zochoten dashes forwards a range equal to his movement, traveling forwards with an echo despite holding a strong form and stance. He then grabs an enemy adjacent to him and activates all of the epithet energy within him at once, performing a massively damaging combo from all sides that deals damage equal to his red stat. - Stage 1 - Movement section ignores all terrain. - Stage 2 - Target hit crumples in pain, having to spend their next move action to get up.

talent,Soph'et,Prepared Casting,,,As a bonus action Soph’et can cast a spell before storing it. The spell floats as an orb trailing behind him. For every round the spell is stored it’s effective tier cost is lowered by 1 to a minimum of 1. Soph’et is able to store up to 3 spells at a single time and he may release a stored spell as if it were an Any-Time.

passive,Soph'et,Mana,,,Soph’et’s spells are powered through his trained inner well of Mana. He starts combat with 3 Mana and gains an amount of Mana equal to 1/10 of their current proficiency. Soph’et uses this Mana in place of stamina for the cost of his abilities.

ability,Soph'et,Free Cast,2,,Soph’et attempts to cast a spell spontaneously. He can combine up to two Spell Words and the spell cannot be up-cast.
ability,Soph'et,Cantrip,0,,"A simple but effective skill that you're so trained in as to consume no mana to cast. The spell uses only one Spell Word of yours and cannot be upcast, but cannot fail even on a crit failure (though its effect may be very slight in such a case)."

ability,Soph'et,Transmute,1,,"Spells of the Transmutation School start with one of a set of Core Words. Shape, Move, Alter, Augment, and Change. This school specializes in changing things that already exist, bending reality to your will. Effects something in your casting range, and if the spell would deal damage is does 4."
weapon,Siegfried,Crowbar,,,"5 damage 1 range. 23. Second Hand - After making a successful attack with his Crowbar Basic Attack (or any other melee, one handed weapon), Siegfried may pay 1 stamina, morphing his open arm into hardened smoke and performing a slugger hit on a unit within melee range. This deals 5 damage, and either knocks a hit unit prone or inflicts them with Blindness until the start of their next turn (Siegfried’s choice). If targeting the same unit hit by the initial Crowbar, Siegfried must pay 2 stamina instead of 1. Note: Unless the unit is somehow completely unaware of Siegfried’s presence after the first hit, enemies will typically be aware of Sig after getting slammed with a crowbar. So unless he is able to somehow avoid it, concealment for Creeping in Fog is hard to maintain between these two attacks. I’m just saying it here before someone asks in the thick of a moment."
passive,Siegfried,Creeping In Fog,,,Your vision is not impaired by smoke. While striking from concealment you may add an additional 1d6 to your damage on a successful hit. 27. Get Smoked - Creeping in Fog’s 1d6 extra damage has a minimum of 3.
passive,Siegfried,Passion Fumes,,,"Like hell Siegfried’s going down without a fight! After Siegfried takes a hit that deals 15+ damage, or a hit that puts him under 10 Stamina, his body begins expelling smoke like crazy as his temperature skyrockets. While in this “Fuming State” Siegfried gains a +3 to all damage he deals, and +1 to all damage his summons/constructs deal. Siegfried can also expend Fuming State in order to make one of his actions unnaturally crit. However, this is not a critical in the sense that it makes Siegfried’s roll count as an unnatural 20. Siegfried must call that he is using the crit before he rolls, and the crit’s effectiveness is based on how Siegfried rolls, so he can still potentially fail. If he does fail, he loses Fuming State unless he pays 2 stamina."
passive,Kiro Kiro No Mi,Featherweight,,,"You can become as light as a feather or as heavy as something thats like a thousand kilograms, but you like being lighter generally anyway. You can adjust your weight as an unrolled anytime action once per round. While on the light side of things you can push off the ground to go 1.5x your movement straight up and you will move one square back down every other turn in a direction of your choice.  Devil’s Power Grows 2. Featherweight lets you move 2x your move speed upwards when light."
ability,Siegfried,Smoking Buddy,3,,"Once per round, you may summon a puppet composed entirely of smoke. It has 5 stamina, 6 movement, and deals 5 damage. It cannot speak, can float over small gaps, and can act autonomously in accordance with commands. They are summoned adjacent to you, and you have a max of 1. 19. SmokeSTACKED - Smoking Buddy now has its maximum amount of Buddies increased to 3. When using the ability, Siegfried may choose to either summon up to 2 of the standard Smoking Buddies, or a singular “Smokestacked Buddy”; who is 2x2 in size, has 10 Stamina, 4 movement, and an 8 damage basic attack at base. When summoning a Smokestacked Buddy, Siegfried can produce a smoke-weapon of his choice for the Buddy to wield, which may augment its capabilities."
ability,Siegfried,Billowing Blowout,3⛯,,"Siegfried solidifies his stance and takes a deep breath in as his chest puffs up to a cartoonish degree. He then releases an 8 space, 90° cone of smoke in a long, continuous, pressurized blast containing glass particles in the shape of fists. This deals 10-12 damage to all units within the area, which passes through physical DR. Siegfried can choose for this attack to send all hit units to the edge of its range if he so desires. Once per Combat. Upon a successful activation of this ability, Siegfried can choose to either: A.) Have the smoke created from the ability stay on the combat arena for 1d2 rounds. Or B.) Have a smoke cloud as per Effort Emission appear around every hit unit. The size of the cloud is determined by the roll for Billowing Blowout. 6-11 = 1x1 Cloud. 12-16 = 2x2 Cloud. 17-20 = 3x3 Cloud."
ability,Siegfried,Puff and Pass,1!,,"Anytime, once per round, when you are the target of an attack or ability you may replace yourself with a cloud of smoke. By spending 2 additional stamina, you may also teleport behind the attacker. At no additional cost, you may instead intercept an attack directed at a target within 6 tiles of yourself."
ability,Siegfried,Smoke Construct,2,,Once per round you may create a stationary construct out of smoke. This construct must start adjacent to you and may occupy up to 4 tiles. You may only have a max of 8 tiles worth of constructs at once. 35. Quick Fix - Smoke Construct can now be used as a Bonus Action if Siegfried pays an additional 2 Stamina or if he expends a Cloud from Effort Emission (this counts as the buff granted from Effort Emission).
ability,Siegfried,Steam Train,2,,"Siegfried hunches over and assumes a runner’s stance, before the sound of a steam locomotive whistling can be heard. He then bursts forward at blistering speeds, producing a giant, 3x3 smoke cloud behind him. Using this ability, Siegfried can travel up to his Movement Speed +5 spaces, and he must travel in a straight line. As he does, each space he dashes across has a smoke cloud left on it. While moving via this ability, Siegfried has the ability to power through difficult terrain, and potentially other terrain hazards. This burst gives Siegfried a ton of momentum, which he can use to perform athletic and acrobatic feats, along with generically boosting the damage of attacks performed out of the dash. But that’s not all, when Siegfried performs this ability, any Smoking Buddies he passes adjacent to can join him in running! This ability uses Siegfried’s Movement Action."
ability,Kiro Kiro No Mi,Gram Slam,X!,,"Drop all the way down to the earth as an anytime,the cost is between 1 and 3 depending on how high you increase your weight category for damage which has benefits.1 cost deals a flat 4 damage and allows you to hit anyone within your falling down range, 2 can hit anyone within 2 squares from your current position for 4 damage and allows you to knock them 4squaresin any direction of your choice, 3 is a flat vertical drop for 7 damage and targets have disadvantage to counter it. Once per round."
ability,Kiro Kiro No Mi,Weighty Blow,2,,"The user delivers a powerful attack, boosting the weight of their move part way through to amplify its kinetic energy! This acts as a use of your basic attack, but with +3 damage and +3 knockback, or you can trade off the knockback for a prone effect. These effects work regardless of the targets’ size."
weapon,Brave,Heroic Punch!,,,Brave does one of the coolest things a hero can do! PUNCH AN ANTAGONIST! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (3 damage melee range)
weapon,Brave,Blast Wave!,,,"Dai Brave’s Blast Wave not-signature-technique is nothing to sneeze at, he’s taken down many a villain with even in his short time as a hero. Deals 4 damage at 5 range and pierces through evildoers dealing half damage to every other one it hits."
talent,Brave,Your Cheers Keep Me Going!!,,,"When Brave fails a roll and his ally cheers for him, he may heal for 5 stamina instead of getting the reroll. The rest of the conditions apply."
passive,Brave,The Super Star,,,"Brave is The Hero and The Hero cannot lose or else the kids would cry. If Brave were to *somehow* fail a roll, one of his allies may cheer him on in a “Don’t Give Up! You Can Do It Brave!!” kind of way. Hearing the pleas of his fans/allies gives him a confidence boost and allows him to roll that action again, this may only happen once per roll and the same ally may not cheer him on again until all of his allies have cheered him on. Once all of his allies (the important ones anyway) have cheered him on at least once they can choose to cheer him on his turn in unison allowing him to transform into his ultimate form. Brave is not easily turned against his allies, if something like this is attempted and looks like it would succeed one of his allies can cheer to try and snap him back to reality. The Super Star: Final Cheer - Brave’s 2nd Hero Transformation which can only be attained when he hears the cheers and support of his allies. When Brave hears the support of all of his allies at once, once per combat, he is able to undergo a heroic transformation into “Dai Brave”. Dai Brave is instantly powered up, putting him up to 10 stamina (if he is below that), giving him a +2 to all his rolls, his movement is increased by 2 and increasing the damage of his “Heroic Punch” by 3. This also augments some of his kit. However he is now at the peak of his heroic powers, he may only receive the cheers of one of his allies per round (and Francis)."
ability,Brave,Protection of The Mighty,1!,,"Brave protects the smiles of children and the bodies of his allies. In a flash he moves as though teleporting to intercept an attack aimed at his allies, he then takes the attack himself receiving half the damage it would have dealt rounded down to a minimum of 1. He is The Hero and no one should get hurt at his expense. Once per round. If he has had his “Final Cheer” and is currently Dai Brave, he may roll once again to reflect the attack back at an enemy within 4 range, failing this roll means he just takes the damage as normal and it may not be cheered to allow him to roll again."
ability,Brave,BRAVE FLASH!,2,,"Brave’s signature move. He charges up a big ol’ blast of energy and swipes in front of him, sending out a 4 damage projectile that goes 4 range. Up to 2 People who have not cheered him on can choose to cheer him on to do one of the following: - Add a piercing effect - Add +2 damage - Add +2 range - Add a minor burn effect - Or refresh the ability! Once per Combat. If he fails, the secondary cheering effect cannot happen. DAI BRAVE FLASH! (2) - Dai Brave raises his hands to his dastardly opponents and readies his SIGNATURIER technique! A flash of light erupts from his hands, dealing 6 damage to everyone in a line of 6 in front of him, and melting completely through walls. He may pay an extra 2 stamina at the start of the ability to Punch the nearest person in the line as a follow-up for 2 damage. Dai Brave may only use this ability when in “Final Cheer” and he can *not* use “BRAVE FLASH!” while he has access to this ability."
ability,Brave,Francis,3⛯!,,"Brave’s biggest fan. Always hiding in places he’s not supposed to be and revealing himself at the worst moments. This ability must be used to either cause something bad to a teammate or Brave himself. Nonetheless, the biggest fans have the biggest cheers, Francis being here gives all of Brave’s rolls a +2 and he is able to cheer Brave’s failed rolls an extra time, he is also not bound by the limitation of not being able to cheer if he has already cheered. However, he is almost certainly in grave danger, just him appearing gives Brave worry (in the form of ability stamina cost), Brave has to pay a 1 stamina upkeep per round and if he does not he has to try and convince Francis to go home. Francis has 8 movement, cannot attack and any time Francis might take damage Brave is automatically put into the way of the attack and takes the maximum damage the attack could deal to a single target for him but while he is adjacent to Brave, enemies have disadvantage targeting him. If Brave is knocked out Francis gives one final cheer before running home, this cheer is rolled, if a Nat 20 is rolled Brave is revived at 1 stamina and has advantage on his next 3 rolls but Francis cannot be found during the next combat (If Brave is in Final Cheer mode this happens automatically). Once per combat. Francis can not be made to appear by anyone else, there is also only one of him."
weapon,Soviet,Bottle of Zhuravli,,,"Soviet’s preferred brand of Vodka. It does 5 damage, mostly due to his overwhelming strength, but its contents could knock out a bear (and has before. Ask him about it sometime). Anyone who drinks from the bottle will be out for the count, but of course this has no effect on Soviet. Drinking from the bottle restores 3 stamina. Bar Fight (2) - This isn’t Soviet’s first rumble, and it sure as hell won’t be his last. Soviet breaks the bottle over his head, doing damage to himself (the stamina cost) and turning his trusty Bottle of Zhuravli into a Broken Bottle of Zhuravli, upping its damage by two points but removing all of its contents."
weapon,Soviet,Hopak,,,"Soviet Union crosses his arms as he squats down as he turns the classic Hopak/Cossack dance into a deadly weapon! His kicks are lightning quick, and there is no doubt that his technique is immaculate. This is a multi-hit attack, with each of Soviet’s 3 kicks he performs dealing 1 damage. Soviet can funnel Movement into this attack at a 1-to-1 ratio, and each Movement adds an extra kick."
talent,Soviet,Iron Gut,,,"Having lived in Russia his entire life, Soviet has drunk more than a few questionable things. Any liquid that he drinks will have no negative effect on Soviet, and any positive effects he would receive from them have a chance of being bolstered. (The chance for improvement does not apply to Bottle of Zhuravli, as he’s too used to drinking it)"
talent,Soviet,Elemental Bending: Ice (Soviet Version),,,"Soviet is able to harness the element of cold, ice, and snow, creating and manipulating it in limited quantities. When performing actions, he can utilize this to augment them, and/or, if he wants, he can use a Bonus Action to perform small elemental feats on his own. Depending on the severity of the desired effect(s), he may need to pay varying amounts of Stamina. Soviet is now able to pay up to 4 Stamina at the start of his turn to create an equivalent amount of Frozen North Spaces anywhere on the battlefield. If he is creating a Frozen North tile on an occupied space, he must roll for it. Along with this, Soviet is able to walk across Frozen North spaces without using up any of his Movement Action. Additionally, instead of resistance, Soviet is immune to cold/ice damage, unless he wishes to take the damage for whatever reason."
passive,Soviet,Comrade in Arms,,,"At the beginning of the game, Soviet chooses an ally to recruit to the cause of the USSR, making them his Comrade. This Comrade receives advantage to any rolls involving Soviet, and can pass through The Iron Curtain without a save. They also have a decrease in cold damage. On top of this, Soviet and his Comrade can pay 1 Stamina to turn the spaces they move across into “Frozen North” spaces, which are covered in snow. These spaces reduce movement by 1 each, for a maximum of 2 (This effect only lasts for the time the enemy remains on the spaces)."
passive,Soviet,The Might of Russia,,,"Soviet exudes an overwhelming presence that anyone in the room can feel, probably because he is 147 kilograms of pure muscle. He gains advantage in any intimidation rolls."
ability,Soviet,The Russian Reversal,X!,,"Things are different in Russia, and in Soviet’s eyes EVERYWHERE is Russia. Invoking the power of Yakov Smirnoff, Soviet can take any two words in an action and swap them around to change the outcome of the action. Costs more stamina the bigger the outcome of the word swap. Once per Round."
ability,Soviet,Seize The Means of Production,3,,"What’s mine is yours and yours is mine comrade! Once per combat during his turn, Soviet can take the health of every player character away, average them out (rounded up), and redistribute them. (Note, the stamina penalty is taken AFTER the redistribution.)"
ability,Soviet,The Iron Curtain,1!,,"A bit more literal this time around, Soviet uses his russian steelworking skill to erect a giant steel wall adjacent to him (diagonals do not count) that takes up a single space. This wall cannot be passed through by enemies or attacks and allies must pass a save to go over it. These can be placed anywhere within reason. 46. Communism Never Sleeps - Iron Curtain’s wall becomes a 3x1, and if someone is standing directly behind it, they can spend a Main or Movement Action to craft explosive weapons of their choice."
ability,Soviet,Seeing Red,2,,"All that he surveys is property of Soviet Russia. Anything within three spaces he can turn Red, both figuratively and literally. Any object he turns red can produce golden hammers and sickles, which he can control from those objects (for 1 stamina). Doing so also turns any spaces adjacent (including diagonals) into “Frozen North” spaces (see passive)."
ability,Soviet,Pin of Gorbachev,1!,,"This pin gives the user the power to fix what is broken. Once per round, the user can “reform” anything, from restoring half of stamina taken (rounded up), to lessening status conditions, to fixing objects that were recently broken."
ability,Soviet,The Terror of Siberia,X,,"The toughest beast of the USSR shows itself: The Siberian Bear. Soviet Union chooses up to a 3x3 square of Frozen North spaces, and from them, a bear comes slashing out!. If a singular Frozen North space was used, it is 1x1. If a 2x2 of Frozen North Spaces were used, it is 2x2. If a 3x3 of Frozen North Spaces were used, it is a 3x3. For each size category, it gains 6 stamina, and its basic attack goes up by 4 damage. It has four movement (unless it is a 3x3, in which case it has 3) and sometimes even a machine gun. When summoned, its slash deals its basic attack to all enemies in the area. If a bear 2x2 or larger is created, this ability cannot be used on Soviet’s next turn, and only two bears can be on the field at a time. A summoned bear is explicitly able to move and act on the turn it is created if Soviet Rolls an 11+, and it gets one or the other on 7+. Cost for this ability is equal to the size category of the bear +1."
weapon,Adam,Banhammer,,,A giant sledgehammer shrouded in darkness Anyone killed with this weapon cannot be resurrected by any means other than the end of that combat scenario. 3 damage 1 range.
talent,Adam,[Kicked due to inactivity],,,Anyone who doesn't move at least 1 space on their turn takes 3 damage by the end of it.

ability,Adam,Shadow Spike,3,,"Make a physical spike of shadow, dealing 3 damage to someone at a target location within 6 range. Anyone hit by it cannot move more than 3 spaces away from it without being warped back into the radius around it. Disappears at the end of their next turn"
ability,Adam,External Plugin,3!,,"Adam can’t be everywhere at once, so he installs plugins to automate things. In combat, he can install someone else’s passive (determined by a roll) to one of his allies, or himself. Only one passive can be equipped per person. Once per round."
ability,Adam,Command Line,3!,,"The power of a god, Adam can use a variety of abilities to change the flow of battle. Once per round - teleport - Teleports him to an ally - spawn - Allows him to spoon an object into existance (must be present on the map already) - smite - Strikes an area with lightning for one damage and sets the ground on fire - timeset - Changes the time of day - weather - Changes the weather"
weapon,Toxic,AUX Cord,,,"Toxic is able to control the AUX cord of her headphones as if it were an extension of her body, and its movements often resemble that of a snake. Deals 5 damage with 2 range."
weapon,Toxic,Bubble Blowout,,,"Toxic takes out a piece of bubble gum, chews it, blows a bubble, and then plugs the end of her AUX Cord into it. This fills the bubble with concentrated sound waves. It moves 2 spaces per round, homing in on an enemy of Toxic’s choice. Upon colliding with them, it deals 1 damage, and allows an adjacent ally of Toxic’s (if there are any) to follow up with a basic attack."
talent,Toxic,Open Your Ears,,,"Toxic is just about always wearing her headphones, but when she isn’t, her hearing is amplified and damn near perfect. She cannot be deafened."
passive,Toxic,Background Music,,,"Toxic is pretty much always listening to music. It’s hard for her to focus on things without it. As such, when in combat, she puts her “beats to beat people up to” playlist on loop. This playlist currently has 5 songs on it, and she can arrange them in any order she wants. Each song lasts for 1 round, and she gains a specific buff while listening to each one. Once a song has been listened to, it cannot be replayed until all of the others are cycled through. “Hell Pepper” by Devil Wing. A hard rock song that goes in really, REALLY hard. Gives a 1.5x multiplier (rounded up) to all damage Toxic deals, and adds a fire element to everything she does. Her body heat similarly goes up drastically. “Round the Town” by Caution Tape. A Hideki Naganuma/Jet Set Radio style song that makes you want to get up and move. Gives Toxic +3 movement and allows her to scale surfaces regardless of physics. Styling, especially when unnecessary, can also give bonuses to her actions. “Love Letter” by Sweet Dreams. A future funk song with beats coming straight out of the 80s. Heals Toxic 1 stamina for each 2 spaces of movement she uses, and heals allies who she passes by for 2 stamina each the first time she does so. Also gives her a +2 on non-damaging actions. “Electric Eel” by Beetz. Techno with a lot of bass and chiptune thrown in, making a unique, video game-y sound. Adds an electric element to all of Toxic’s actions, and makes contact with her deal 1 electric damage. Conversely, attacks specifically targeting her roll with -3, as her reflexes are honed to the point where she can more easily dodge. - The fifth song on this playlist tends to change around a lot. Create a song, and a single effect said song can grant you. If you like a particular song enough, you can make it a permanent addition to the playlist, therefore allowing it to have secondary and, potentially, tertiary effects. This cannot be done very often, however."
ability,Toxic,Noise Cancelling,2!,,"Toxic uses her headphones to completely block out the world around her. This makes everything in a 10ft radius around her a “dead zone” where attacks/effects cannot pass through. Upon use of this ability, the dead zone lasts until Toxic’s next turn. Once per round."
ability,Toxic,Tangled Mess,3,,"Toxic sends her AUX Cord flailing in every which way, completely tangling itself and any objects in a 3 space line up. From there, she can either detach the cord from her headphones and create a new one, or immediately toss all of the objects somewhere else regardless of their weight. Units stuck in the cords must roll to escape, and take 1.5 times damage from attacks as the cords continue tying knots around them."
ability,Toxic,Bass Boost Boomburst,3⛯,,"The air reverberates in a 2xinfinite line as Toxic’s headphones begin rattling. After a moment, the bass drops as sound waves blast forward, dealing around 7-10 damage to any enemies along the path. This blast can be maintained for as long as Toxic wants, but she must pay a 2 stamina upkeep and her movement is reduced to 1. However, she can still perform other actions while blasting. Once per combat."
ability,Toxic,Volume Warning,1,,"This allows Toxic to create an ethereal pair of headphones that attach to a unit of her choice. The headphones then blare a sound/song of her choice, dealing around 3-5 damage (unless she intentionally lowers the volume) and inflicting them with a status based on the sound. While these headphones are on someone, they have a very hard time hearing things happening around them."

talent,Kristen,Moving At My Own Pace,,,"Kristen is the master of her own movement in time, and cannot have it negatively slowed or stopped."
passive,Kristen,Passage of The Dual Elements,,,"Kristen has some manipulation over the concept of passing time, which manifests as fire and ice depending on if she speeds up or slows down time, respectively. This gives her a few modes she may embody, which changes what her abilities do. She may change her mode once at the very start of her turn.   Neutral Mode: The mode Kristen is naturally in. Neutral actions do not use her epithet, so they aren’t affected by anything that would interact with such. This also means she does not get proficiency for critical successes since she is not utilizing her epithet.   Speed Mode: In Speed Mode, Kristen becomes fiery and feisty, small fires dotting her body. She gains +1 movement, DR1 vs fire damage, and her attacks may now deal fire damage.   Slow Mode: In Slow Mode, Kristen becomes icy and haughty, frost forming in patches across her body. She gains -1 movement, DR1 vs cold damage, and her attacks may now deal cold damage."
ability,Kristen,Neutral - Flip Strike!,3,,"Kristen does an acrobatic pirouette over her opponent, slashing at them twice (as separate rolls) and throwing them off, forcing disadvantage on their next roll. This places her on the other side of the target."
ability,Kristen,Speed - Immolation,3,,Target begins burning alive. 3 damage now and 2 damage every time it’s their turn until they save.
ability,Kristen,Slow - Cryofreeze,3,,"Target becomes encased in ice. They cannot move. Attacks against them have advantage and actions and anytimes they use have disadvantage. Blunt attacks do extra damage, but Bladed attacks do less damage and lower the save req. by one for each strike."
ability,Kristen,Neutral - Parry,1!,,"Kristen parries an attack, with high rolls allowing her a counterattack with her basic weapon if the attacker is within range."
ability,Kristen,Speed - Burn Back,1!,,"By speeding up time, and therefore atomic motion, Kristen causes the temperature in the air to spike near instantaneously via friction, incinerating most things in a circular 10 meter area, including incoming attacks. On high rolls, this can inflict burning"
ability,Kristen,Slow - Flash Freeze,1!,,"By slowing time, and therefore atomic motion, Kristen causes the temperature in the air to drop near instantaneously, forming crystals of ice around her. These crystals shatter on contact, disrupting attacks, but can be left untouched as a trap."
ability,Kristen,Neutral - Whirlwind,3,,"A whirling spin attack that pushes anyone nearby back, knocking them off balance and leaving them open for a followup from a nearby ally."
ability,Kristen,Speed - Firestorm,3,,"1 fire damage for everyone. Everyone else makes a roll at the start of your turn, failure (5 or less) means target is now on fire and takes 1 damage now and every round until they are put out (roll dependant on action required to put out, may choose not to put themselves out if they don’t want to spend that action)."
ability,Kristen,Slow - Blizzard,3,,"1 ice damage for everyone. -1 movement for everyone besides you while in the area. Every 2 rounds someone spends time in this area this penalty increases. Reaching 0 movement means you cannot move, and you begin taking damage = to your negative movement score. Every round spent outside the area lowers the movement penalty by 1 (including if the area becomes a Firestorm)"
weapon,Icaria,Cupid's Bow,,,The signature bow of the Big C himself. Icaria happened to be borrowing it when she fell out of heaven. Big C’s probably real upset about that. 4 damage 4 range.
talent,Icaria,Guardian Angel,,,"There’s no way Icaria’s gonna let someone good (or at least someone she thinks is good) get hurt! As such, when adjacent to allies, they have damage reduction of -2."
passive,Icaria,Sorry to Keep You Waiting!,,,"The god that watches over Icaria is always waiting for her to prove that she’s worthy enough to come back up there, and Icaria is always here to please! Whenever Icaria shows incredible prowess in combat or helps a good person in need, if it is enough to impress her god, they will award her a given number of Heaven Points. These points can be expended either to simply improve rolls, or to create cloud platforms that Icaria can jump up to."
passive,Icaria,Tile Toss And Turn,,,"You get a new passive, which gives you a lil’ square on your outfit, perfect for fitting your gods favorite tiles into! If Icaria rolled a 20 at any point during a combat, she gains a tile imbued with a bonus effect based on whatever unfolded after it has ended. These bonuses, however, are usually small, and you can only have one at a time. But they’re collectable! You have a lil’ box of your favorites at home."
ability,Icaria,Divine Divebomb,2,,"Icaria extends her wings and begins flying up as much as her poor body can manage, locking onto a target in the process. Then, with a quick spin, she divekicks down to the target aiming for wherever looks the most kickable. This deals 5 damage and drags the target 3 spaces at minimum. However, the higher up Icaria is relatively to the target when she initiates this ability, the higher the damage and drag distance will be."
ability,Icaria,Stairway To Heaven,1!,,"With a hop and a skip, Icaria suddenly leaps forward and upwards towards the sky. She can take anything or anyone adjacent to her with her while she does, and is able to take 3 spaces worth of flutter-steps before must stop. This is normally a once per round ability, but landing on a cloud platform created from Heaven Points restores its usage for a particular round."
ability,Icaria,Hell Zone,3⛯,,"Icaria produces a 3x3 ring constructed of darkness on a surface, and anyone who steps in it suddenly has a cracked halo above their head. If any enemy is in the Hell Zone at the start of their turn. If an enemy is in the Hell Zone, the cracked halo above them fills them with so many evil thoughts that they lash out, and their attacks hit their allies as well as their enemies. They are also more likely to listen to commands given from Icaria while in this state. As a bonus, Icaria can move the Hell Zone anywhere within her sight as a free action on her turn, taking anything inside it with it. Once per combat."
ability,Icaria,Matchmaker,2,,"This bow being owned by the Big C isn’t just for show y’know! Icaria locks two cute lil’ heart arrows in her bow and fires them at two separate targets (for 2 damage each). These two are now infatuated (but not in love, because if Icaria had that power god help us all.) Anyway! While the two struck do have advantage on actions they do together, they have disadvantage on actions they do apart, and too long away from their lover may make them lovesick! Having them take damage that only deepens the scars of their forbidden love… If used on two targets that are already in love, this not only increases the chance of stuff working out with them (yay!), but also has the lovesickness effect at least double."
ability,Icaria,Perse-Phone,3,,"Icaria has made (sometimes reluctant) friends, some of them being gods. She takes out her handy dandy Heaven Phone and calls in a favour from any god she desires, by reminding them of the time Icaria did something for them and politely asking them to pay back the favour right about now. The thing that Icaria did for them must be said for the ability to work."

ability,Tommy,A Weapon To Surpass Metal Gear,"?, ? red stat",,"Using energy from his bar, Tommy can shoot a nuclear blast from his hands that grows in power the more stamina and energy he puts into it. (Note: Failed rolls do not take the energy cost, but they do take the stamina cost)"

Note that Gold Dust Woman has a movement action of her own and has to follow Aurum herself. As a bonus action, Aurum can dispell (and then summon) GDW on his turn. Gold London - Aurum can change  Gold Dust Woman into a CD and throw it into someone, having them control Gold Dust Woman for however long Aurum wishes. Any damage dealt to GDW while being controlled by someone else is still given to Aurum. I prefer the term ""Hired Gun"" - Gold Dust Woman can keep objects within her gold-dust-y mass, as a sortof container for handy dandy materials, or hiding murder weapons. Usually they're covered in gold dust and uncomfortable to hold though. At the end of a session, he may choose 1 item to take between sessions."
ability,Aurum,See ya at Sunrise,3!,,"An ally flickers out of existence for a few times before disappearing. They reappear at the start of their turn, but for them they just teleported to the future. This can be used on enemies if they have a Gold Dust stack. It can also be used on objects."

Sunrise - Aurum uses the sunny barrel firing a large bullet, dealing 8 damage at 8 range and throwing a 2X3 field of Gold Dust out.

She can reach into one of her bags and get some dust to blow into someone's face or try and do something else with it. The dust she pulls is determined by a 1d10, pulling the dust out is considered a once per round free action and using it is an action. She can mix powders to increase their effect but only two at a time.1, Black Pepper - You must have grabbed the wrong bag because this just has some regular black pepper in it. There’s a 50/50 chance it will make someone sneeze, but otherwise tastes good on food. 2, Magnesis Magnolia - For one round the target becomes magnetically charged, their head is considered the positive pole and their feet the negative pole. 3, Purple Root - You can tell this one is poisonous because of its signature Poison Purple color. Deals 1d4 poison damage each round but can be fought off using a free action after each instance of poison damage. 4, Color Blind - When consumed, this powder removes your ability to discern color of any kind for the rest of combat, making everything shades of black and white. 5, Seven Heavens - A delicious sugary substance that heals for 3 stamina. 6, Cast Iron - A magic dust that forms metal casts around a specified body part on a target for one round restricting/removing its ability to move.  7, Bitter Crumble - This dust is an aging catalyst that rapidly ages nonliving targets, like causing metal to rust, or rotting some wood. 8, Sure Victory - Grants a +1 to rolls for the rest of combat. 9, Electric Impulse - For 1d4+1 turns this powder increases the target’s speed dramatically, anytimes are temporarily rolled with disadvantage because the speed is too much to handle, but regular abilities become temporary anytimes and Once Per Combat abilities lose that limitation for the duration of the effect. 10, Restful Slumber - This powder aids with sleep and guarantees 1 round of slumber upon those who inhale or otherwise ingest it.

Run & Gun: Lilin May spend X FF while moving to assign X damage as she wishes amongst targets in range (Sweet From may choose to heal targets this way instead) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxLII2uxnNmrRofhJd6srr0iQZx23ermUNJNgWRrst0/edit?usp=sharing "
ability,Lilin,Devilish Dress-Up,2,,"Lilin makes and stores clothes in hell to infuse them with infernal energy. Wearing these clothes has various benefits. Lilin can only be affected by 3 benefits at once, but may cast this again to change 1 effect. While under 3 effects, she additionally generates 1 FF a turn. Choose from below:  - Increase max FF by 5 (to 25) - Ignore the next instance of feedback damage from a summon and lose this buff - Burn FF for DR. if you reduce FF to 0 this way, lose this buff - Specify a new buff like resistance etc."
ability,Lilin,Command Belial,2,,"Lilin may spend her move action to cast this without generating FF. Lilin commands Belial. This may be to move and attack, to perform a specific action, or to protect Someone for a turn, where he rolls against the next attack directed at the target being protected. If he beats it by 5 or more the attack is deflected, if not, it hits him instead. (Belial - 5 damage. 6 Movement. Flying. If Belial is hit for 10 or more damage he is reduced to his diminished form for one turn per 10 dealt. (2 damage, no fly speed, may not protect))"
ability,Lilin,"Surgat, Seek Me",1,,Lilin Summons a tiny lizardlike demon that can unlock any lock. Additionally he can squeeze into tight spaces.
passive,Ori Ori No Mi,I CAN BREAK THESE CUFFS,,,"As someone who can pass through people to apply some form of restraint to them you, yourself are immune to any form of restraint and can freely exit any restraint on you as long as your powers are not actively being negated."
ability,Ori Ori No Mi,Rat in a Cage,3,,Create a 3x3 trap made of iron to stop targets from escaping. These Cages have a total of 10 stamina with 10 hardness (essentially DR against physical damage)
ability,Ori Ori No Mi,Bracer Blast,1,,"By swinging your arms, you send a metal restraint forwards up to 7 range, grabbing the first target it passes through and dragging them with it. Then, when it collides with another thing the initial hit target is restrained to it. If it doesn’t collide into another thing, the target is simply restrained in place. This also deals 3 damage on impact. This restraint has 3 stamina and 5 toughness."
ability,Ori Ori No Mi,Shackle Storm,6⛯,,"As a once per combat, cause masses of chains to come roiling out from your body. This deals 8 damage to everyone other than yourself within a 7x7 centered on yourself. Afterwards, for each target you may pay 1 stamina to restrain them, forcing them to either roll with disadvantage or spend a move action to attempt to break free."
weapon,Abigail,Dodgeball Launcher,,,"Basically a large cannon that shoots dodgeballs. Abigail somehow isn’t weighed down by this thing. Abigail can attempt to hit an opponent further away, but they roll with a +2 to dodging it for every 4 tiles between them. If she rolls a critical success when using her weapon(even with one of her abilities), It hits the target in the face, stunning the target, in addition to normal crit effects. When this happens, the target has half movement rounded down for one round. Naturally, for these additional effects, the target must have a head to hit. If they don’t it just applies normal crit effects. 2 Damage 4 Range."
weapon,Abigail,I could crush you like a bug,,,Abigail gains a 6 damage melee attack.
weapon,Abigail,Ya Like DODGEBALL?!,,,"Way back when Abigail joined, she used a big dodgeball cannon that used her epithet. However, she doesn't actually need the cannon to make dodgeballs. These things are essentially balls of epithetical energy that she can throw all day long. For this attack, she throws two dodgeballs close together. Each ball she throws does 3 damage. These things hit hard, but their power only matters if the attack lands… 6 Damage 6 Range."
weapon,Abigail,Overwhelming Strength,,,Abigail is an absolute monster in head to head combat. She can make an attack against an adjacent target to deal 8-9 damage.
talent,Abigail,Dodging the Questions,,,"Abigail is very familiar with interrogation tactics, truth serums, and the like. She can avoid answering any question should she so choose. Her epithet also grants her very high resistance to most things that could compel her to speak or tell the truth."
talent,Abigail,Do You Even Lift?,,,"Abigail’s strength is unrivaled, and she knows how to use it to her advantage. She can lift most things that are not bolted down, and can even lift a lot of things that are. She’s also very good at improvising heavy objects into throwable weapons. Prof 46: I'll beat a motherfucker… - When Abigail uses a person as a weapon, Only one check is made for both picking up the weapon and striking the target. However, this check is rolled with advantage."
talent,Abigail,I’ve actually been working on my speed quite a bit!,,,"Abigail’s default movement speed is 5, despite being a heavyset build, and when she double moves, she gains triple the movement speed instead of double. This still only counts as two movement actions. Prof 36: I’m just going to get faster! - Abigail can now move-act-move."
talent,Abigail,Storm in a Bottle,,,"When Abigail throws a ball in an enclosed space, any balls that are dodged have a chance to rebound into the target anyway. When one of the balls is dodged, Abigail can spend 1 stamina per ball dodged in order to roll those attacks again. This does not apply to any balls that were intercepted. If this is used on balls dodged with projectile storm, the first ball is free."
passive,Abigail,"Dodge This, Asshole!",,,"Abigail’s true power lies in her ability to survive attacks by avoiding them altogether. It turns out, keeping an eye open and watching the battle around you can be very effective when it comes to dodging incoming attacks. Whenever anybody tries to attack her or involve her in any way, she can make a roll to dodge it. Through this passive, she is pretty much capable of dodging anything, even if it doesn’t logically make sense. However, the capability to dodge almost anything comes at a price. Since she is so focused on dodging her enemies' attacks, those enemies have a chance to dodge her! Whenever Abigail makes an attack, the enemy can attempt to dodge it. (Prof 30) Too Easy! - On high dodge rolls, Abigail can redirect the attack. For large projectiles, she usually punches them back into the attacker, her epithet and stand working in tandem to block the damage her hand would take. For small projectiles like bullets, her epithet affects the object as it passes by her, and forces it into a path that strikes an opponent. Finally, for close combat, she usually does unto the attacker what they tried to do to her. Turnabout is fair play, and all that."
passive,Abigail,I Can Work With This,,,"Abigail is very accustomed to the everyday chaos of DBA, and is close friends with a glitchling. As a result, she feels right at home when in a chaotic situation, and knows how to adapt to the chaos, even redirecting it to something preferable. When Abigail rolls on a rollable table, if she doesn’t like the result, she can reroll the table."
passive,Abigail,Flashstep,,,"For her movement action, Abigail can move to any tile, so long as it is in a straight line from her position. This counts as one tile of movement. This can only be used once every three movement actions, natural or otherwise. Double movements count as two movement actions."
ability,Abigail,"If You Can Dodge a Wrench, You Can Dodge a Ball",2,,"Fire your weapon five times. With each shot, the target gains an additional +1 to dodging it."
ability,Abigail,Movement Prediction,2,,"Fire your weapon, predicting how your opponent will dodge. Opponent has to have been attacked by somebody on the field first. If the roll is successful, they roll to dodge with a -3."
ability,Abigail,Avoiding Fate,2!,,"Dodge the numbers on the dice, and reroll your roll. Once per round, and the effect can be used on an ally. 66: Sidestep Fate: Rerolls from Avoiding Fate are counted as advantage."
ability,Abigail,STAND: GO BEAT CRAZY.,2!,,"A barrier forms to intercept incoming damage. If the attack is energetic, or would reasonably bounce off a stone wall, reflect the attack. Prof 73: Crazier Beats - Go Beat Crazy’s barriers are very reflective now, and instead of deflecting everything, it can now reflect attacks back to the attacker, provided that it makes some measure of sense. A sword strike would simply be interrupted, but a magic blast or fireball would be reflected back to the attacker."
weapon,Alan,MEGAPhone,,,"A simple red and white megaphone. Can hit people over the head with it for 4 damage at 1 range. Alan can spend an action to shout either “cut” or “Action” into the megaphone. If he shouts “Cut”, all players other than himself take 2 damage. If he shouts “Action”, everybody except Alan moves 3 spaces in the direction of their choosing. 23: ECHO!!: In any place that has an echo effect (Caves, Grand Halls, etc.) double the effect of Alan’s sound based attacks. The attacks also affect him, but at the original rates."
talent,Alan,Copyright Infringement...What's That?,,,"Alan, despite stealing people's intellectual property on a regular basis seldom gets punished for it. As such any and all rolls made by government officials made against Alan roll with disadvantage."
passive,Alan,The Shatner Effect,,,"ALL characters within 3 tiles around Alan get a +2 bonus to all rolls (including attacks) when they over act their situation, including Alan himself."
passive,Alan,Bad with the Budget,,,"Alan can never properly allocate funds, as such he spends all his money in one place and leaves none left for anything else, making him start each encounter with a stored nat 20, however after he uses it he must face a -1 penalty on all his rolls afterwards (20's are still crits)"
ability,Alan,What? No! It's Not A Self-Insert!,3,,"Alan is able to turn into nearly any movie character. Can take multiple turns. Must return to original form to change into something else. Returning to base form is free, and takes no turns. While in another form, current weapon, as well as this ability is temporarily replaced with a character specific ability and weapon. Ability and weapon return to normal upon returning to normal form."
ability,Alan,"What Do You Mean: ""Somebody Else Did It First""?",3,,"Alan can use any trope from TvTropes. Trope is determined by pressing the random trope button on the TvTropes Homepage. He can only use one trope at a time. He can use that particular trope until he rerolls it. It costs the same as this ability, and overrides it."
ability,Alan,"No, no no, do it again! With feeling this time!",1!,,"Alan doesn't like that take, so we're running it back. Roll again. Once per round."
weapon,Gerald.exe,Virus Killer,,,"An electric USB Wire fashioned into a whip, can be used to cause 3 damage in 6 range."
talent,Gerald.exe,Extra Battery Pack,,,"Knowing that he greatly relies on his abilities, Gerald packed an extra Battery pack for the road. The extra power gives you Plus 1 Range on his electric whip and extra health.  "
passive,Gerald.exe,"What’d you think it’d do, dummy?",,,Electric Damage Heals Gerald.exe at the cost of being weak to spikes.
ability,Gerald.exe,Reprogrammed For Fun!,1!,,By coming into contact with another character they can use this anytime to copy any of their abilities Gerald has seen them use for a limited use of 3 times. He can carry a maximum of 8. Stamina Cost of copied abilities are the same as the copied ability. Anytimes are once per round.
ability,Gerald.exe,Now I’ve got your power!,3,,"Hook into an enemy’s very being using your USB whip to drain energy and power from them which can then be fired anytime for a range of 8 spaces. Effect, Damage and Usefulness vary from who you steal power from. Get creative!"
ability,Gerald.exe,The Infection Grows,3,,Infect any electronic device into becoming your minion. What it does is up to you and what the device is. If used on robotic enemy player characters they will be on your team for one round.
weapon,Ravenfeather,Scythe,,,"Melee weapon, deals 6 damage. When he successfully connects a hit, half the damage dealt is added to the soul counter."
talent,Ravenfeather,Voice Dichotomy,,,Raphael has two voices. He has his angelic voice and demonic voice. This gives him a +1 to persuasion and intimidation rolls.
talent,Ravenfeather,Raphael's Resistances,,,Raphael takes less damage from dark or shadow type attacks. Raphael also takes less damage from Light based attacks.
talent,Ravenfeather,Shadow Step,,,Raphael can now walk through walls and other solid objects by bending his soul through them. His soul reforms back into its solid form as soon as he leaves the object. He cannot end his movement in an object.
passive,Ravenfeather,Soul Jar,,,"Raphael has access to a counter known as “Soul Points.” Soul Points are tracked with Raphael’s red stat. These points can be increased or spent by Raphael’s abilities. With the exception of “Purgatory,” Raphael can spend soul points in place of stamina. “Purgatory” has its own soul point cost."
ability,Ravenfeather,Heaven,2!,,"Heal a target on the field, maximum amount determined by soul points. Once per round."
ability,Ravenfeather,Hell,2,,Target a space up to six tiles away. Drain 3 Stamina from any characters either on that tile or one adjacent to it. Damage dealt is added to the soul point counter. Once per round.
ability,Ravenfeather,Purgatory,8,,"Target is frozen in time until Raphael’s next turn. All moves charging through the target’s turn must charge for an additional turn, and target cannot activate any abilities until Raphael’s next turn. Target is also frozen in place until the effect resolves, so all rolls to hit target are rolled with +2. Raphael must either pay stamina cost or 15 soul points. "
weapon,Kwint,A Brief Bash,,,Literally. This smacky deals 4 damage at 1 range.
talent,Kwint,*HIC*,,,"Kwint can pull out a seemingly endless supply of a flask or bottle of alcohol, which he can either drink to become inebriated (no heal) or chuck it over someone’s head to deal ~2 damage. Can also be used for general alcoholic purposes like creating molotov cocktails or working as an effective trade."
passive,Kwint,The Greatest Treasure of All,,,"Kwint’s epithet materializes as a special silver briefcase he always carries. As a once per round bonus action on his turn, Kwint can choose to show the briefcase explicitly to a target, activating his epithet on that person. They are suddenly convinced that whatever is inside the briefcase is the thing they want most. This can be material possessions, or it could even be the power for something to happen. This doesn’t need a roll, and because the belief is illogical already nothing can stop someone from believing it. This will make the targets attempt to attack you more often and steal your briefcase, but they roll with a -3 when doing so since you’re so used to these attempts by now. Kwint is also aware of what this object or power is once this is activated. If the object or power is somehow pulled out, it has its full power but has much of its true purpose sealed away, which can only be lifted if the person who wants it sacrifices everything else they have or would ever want, essentially a complete spiritual death where one loses all potential to find purpose in life for this one solitary thing. However, they aren’t aware of this until they remove the object, nor can they rationalize this if they’re told about it while under the effects of this passive. Kwint cannot use this on himself. [30 Prof] Chekhov’s Gun - Kwint can use his briefcase passive on items to gain a copy of that item in his briefcase. This doesn’t count towards the number of triggers that are on actual people for things like Single Target Specialty."
ability,Kwint,Plot Coupon,2,,"Kwint can click open his briefcase, revealing one of the objects or powers that someone believes is in it from Kwint’s passive. He can quickly use it for something before sealing it back into the case. However, despite seeming to have the full power itself, Kwint can only use these abilities roughly inline with how strong they’d be if made by his proficiency level. Other people cannot snag the object or power when you pull it out as if by fate."
ability,Kwint,Briefcase Block,1!,,"Kwint uses his near-invincible briefcase to block an incoming attack, preventing it from damaging him. If used on someone afflicted by your passive, their irrational fear takes over and forces them to make their original attack roll a disadvantaged one, trying not to damage what is inside. Once per round."
ability,Kwint,Big Plot Thing,3⛯,,"Once per combat Kwint can spin his own tale of a very powerful relic or item, which has special powerful properties. However, these properties can only be used under some special archaic conditions and restrictions. The more difficult these are, the stronger the artifact can be. This item is effectively stored into your briefcase as if it were in someone’s mind from your passive. No one is effected with the supernatural draw to get it from you, but they just might try anyway. And unlike items normally created with your passive, it doesn’t need to be limited to your rough prof level when used with Plot Coupon, nor are there any restrictions to unlocking its potential if it is taken out of your briefcase. It can be wielded by anyone."
weapon,Wish,I Could Beat Ya’ Zero Handed,,,"Wish warps space at the center of their fists, causing reality to pinch inwards slightly. This deals 5 damage at 1 range when hitting a target directly. However, alternatively Wish can use it to strike at empty space or a nonliving object to “erase” it, pulling in nearby space to fill what’s missing. This can be used to pull people or objects in from far away despite a size difference, or alternatively getting rid of a single section of something without getting rid of all of it."
weapon,Wish,Typedef Weapon,,,"Whenever Wish is hit with a weapon, she can choose to replace this weapon with a copy of that one for the rest of combat. You can only copy one thing in a combat, and you can’t get rid of what you have copied either. 45: You can now choose to switch the weapon copied by Typedef Weapon."
weapon,Wish,Brass Knuckles ,,,"Weapons you save for when the fight gets serious. Deals 10 damage at 1 range, but can’t crit."
talent,Wish,New Update! Download Now?,,,"When you get proficiency upgrades, if you have an ability filling getAbilityText(), you may choose to replace that upgrade you would’ve gotten with that ability as a new and permanent upgrade! The thing you passed up then goes into storage, letting you replace any of your future upgrades with that one if you desire."
talent,Wish,Undefined Behavior,,,"Null is immune to mind reading or altering effects. This does not provide protection from mental effects, just mind reading and altering."
talent,Wish,Clear Body,,,Status effects that passively require rolls to clear are now cleared automatically whenever you would’ve performed the roll. Status effects that you can’t clear passively with rolls now let you roll once at the start of your turns to try and clear it from you.
passive,Wish,NULL_POINTER,,,"Whenever Wish experiences/is hit by an ability or passive, and this passive isn’t targeting anything, they can choose to target that thing. When doing so, the person is presented with a choice: Either they lose that part of the kit and must function without it, or they get to keep it but you get a copy of it filled in this passive slot. Once chosen they can’t change their mind unless you give them the opportunity yourself. You can only have one thing targeted like this at a time, but you can release your one target on your turn as a free action. This doesn’t work on weapons or talents."
passive,Wish,Virtually Nonexistant,,,"At the start of your turn, you may choose to spend 4 stamina and turn invisible. This requires no roll. While invisible, you have advantage on all actions that target people who can’t perceive you, and obviously your enemy becomes unaware of your location. You are also immune to all terrain hazards while this is active. However, the second you perform an attacking or damaging action successfully, your invisibility shuts off."
ability,Wish,Factoring Space,2!,,"With this ability Wish opens a palm and proceeds to delete the lack of space there. This causes an object to subsequently fill the void left behind. The object needs to be holdable in one hand, but other than that can have any special properties that Wish desires. If this ability were to fail, it instead creates a really messed up and dysfunctional version of the intended object. Once per round."
ability,Wish,Garbage Collection,1!,,"Wish snaps, and suddenly the mass of an object or part of an object is significantly reduced! This allows Wish to force objects to float or have less impact, or alternatively be easier to warp and damage. This effect only lasts one round at max, although Wish can choose to make it a brief momentary effect if she chooses. Once per round."
ability,Wish,getAbilityText(),1,,"This ability spot counts as a blank space. When you use it, you may have it gain up to a sentence of another ability used the previous round put inside it. You can slot that segment of text at the ends or in between any part of the ability. Then after the insert, the ability is immediately used. This continues to mount and mount as the ability gets more complex. You cannot choose to just ignore your insertion, you must at least put a letter somewhere that makes some sense. You cannot copy from once per combats, and while you can copy from anytimes it does not then make this ability an anytime. This ability re-empties itself at the end of combat as the scope of this ability ends."
ability,Wish,Rainbow Magma Spew,1,,"Stomps on the ground, crushing its surface a revealing a river of magma traveling in a line from where she initiated the attack that can have any special properties that Wish desires.. This also puts a tagged counter on them as they are now covered in spray paint. This allows Wish to force objects to float or have less impact, or alternatively be easier to warp and damage."
ability,Wish,Lockdown,1,,"Make a physical spike of shadow, dealing 3 damage to someone at a target location within 6 range. Summons from any nearby shadows some chains made of some dark substance foreign to this plane of existence. May put more energy into the chains, allowing them to seal off epithets or magic-reliant abilities and effects until broken. "
ability,Wish,Exception Throw,2,,"By crossing how different types of data are transferred and interpreted, Wish is able to corrupt a passive, talent, ability, or weapon she’s seen used this combat! However, she also keeps a backup of the previous form, meaning that if she doesn’t like the result she can choose to switch back immediately before applying."
ability,Wish,Void Shock,3,,"Wish points forwards as electricity is pulled out from the surrounding world, magnifying in her finger tip before firing out! This attack acts as an infinite range attack which not only deals 7 damage, but also applies any one secondary effect that one of her other abilities can inflict! On top of that, if the ability succeeds she may immediately pay another 3 stamina and roll to see if the lightning can chain to another target within 3 spaces of the initially hit target, doing the damage and effects again! This chain can continue until you run out of new targets (as you cannot re-chain to the same enemy) or you fail the roll."
weapon,Wally,Weed Wacker,,,"You know what they say: keep your friends close, and your ENEMIES CLOSER. Weed Wacker deals 5 anti weed damage as a melee weapon."
talent,Wally,Green Thumb,,,"Wally is really good with plants, even if he doesn’t want to admit it."
talent,Wally,Tenacious Nuisance,,,"Wally, as a Bonus Action, can let out a devious snicker and extend roots out from any of his limbs in the same manner that he does when using WEED CANNON (although it does not charge WEED CANNON at all). The roots’ emergence is fairly slow, but if Wally manages to dig them into something, he is rooted to them! This can keep him stuck in place, or something stuck to him! Initially, the roots have 1 space of range, but if they stick into something, they then can extend further over time."
talent,Wally,MY BRETHREN ,,,"Wally can speak to plants! What secrets do they hold? It’s difficult to say…they don’t usually talk too much. Depending on how Wally gets along with them, he might be able to convince them to help him out. The effectiveness of these plants is not guaranteed. If Wally talks to any plants he creates with his Epithet, they sound and act exactly like him."
passive,Wally,Invasive Species,,,"Wherever Wally is present, the nutrients of the world are partially stolen. Whenever someone heals, gains a buff, or is affected by something positive, Wally can choose to have a roll off with them. If he rolls higher than them, the positive thing is split between them."
passive,Wally,I AM SPREADING,,,"As combat begins, Wally stances up as his Epithet flares outward, smelling of wet grass. In a 3x3 centered on him, a patch of weeds manifests! This area counts as difficult terrain for any unit except for Wally, and if he starts his turn in the area, Wally heals for 1 Stamina. On any turn past his first, Wally can pay 1 Stamina and use his Movement Action to increase the weed patch’s size category by 1."
ability,Wally,**I AM A MENACE**,1!,,"Wally selects a target, and they must tell him the place they would least like him to be right now. They MUST be honest. And then, of course, Wally immediately teleports to that spot. For situations in which Wally is rooted in the ground, this does not unroot him, making it so his roots are extended from his new current position. Once per round."
ability,Wally,THE WEED CANNON,3,,"Wally extends roots into the ground, making him stuck on the space he is currently standing on. Each turn that he remains rooted, he heals for 1 stamina as he absorbs WATER and NUTRIENTS. However, that’s not all. He is also charging a solar powered mega laser that will absolutely destroy everything in its path. Each round that he charges, the laser gains 5 damage, and releasing the 2xinfinite death causer is a bonus action on his turn. Upon releasing the laser, this ability has a 1 round cooldown. 20. EAT WEED, JACKASS!! - If Wally pays an additional 1 Stamina when activating WEED CANNON, it gains 1d2 rounds of charge immediately! Similarly, when stealing positive effects via Invasive Species, depending on the effects, Wally may be able to convert them into additional rounds of charge for WEED CANNON depending on the effects’ potency."
ability,Wally,Call in WEED MAN,2,,"Wally whistles, alerting his presence to “Weed Man”. Weed Man’s sole goal in life is to remove weeds, and Wally has been his toughest challenge by far. When summoned, Weed Man appears on the opposite end of the arena to Wally, and nothing will stop him. He will attack any enemies he passes by with a 7 damage weed wacker to let off steam before his “big hunt”, and any enemy that damages him becomes the new target of his ire until they are knocked out. Weed Man is only able to be gotten rid of once he sustains 10 or more damage or once he attacks Wally once."

ability,Blossom,Hedgerows,1!,,"Place a 1 by 3 hedge wall within 7 tiles of yourself. It won’t block bullets, since it’s a big bush, but it does break line of sight."
ability,Blossom,Intoxicating Scent,2,,"Blossom hands someone a bunch of flowers. If they are an ally, they gain confidence from the smell, and deal extra damage next turn. If they are an enemy, they are intoxicated by the overpowering smell, and are less likely to hit their opponent on their next turn."
ability,Blossom,It Soothes the Soul!,,,"Blossom produces a cup of refreshing herbal tea. This heals 4 stamina when drunk, and calms the drinker. This is shown in RP, and that their next roll, whatever it is, has a +1 buff. PvE: +1 healing."

weapon,Junebug,Volleyball,,,"A simple volleyball. She can bounce it off an opponent’s face for 2 damage at 5 range, or she can tri-tech with her team to spike it into dealing 7 damage at 6 range. In order for the tri tech to work, two members must roll to pass the ball, and Junebug rolls to spike the ball. This does not take her teammates' actions. Whatever happens, the ball always comes back"
talent,Junebug,Things are Heating Up!,,,Junebug is so used to high temperatures that she is immune to hostile heat-based effects.
passive,Junebug,Meltdown,,,"Junebug gets very angry very easily. Any time that Junebug is attacked, half the damage is added to her Heat Gauge, rounded up. She can also gain heat from getting angry. When she reaches 10, she enters the Meltdown state. All of her abilities gain an additional effect, and she is coated in flame. This effect lasts 2 rounds, after which heat is reset."
ability,Junebug,Scorching Shot,2,,"Jump up and spike the volleyball so hard it turns into a fireball midway! Deal 5 damage at 5 range if it hits, and target takes one fire damage at the start of their turn for 1d3 rounds. *Meltdown:* With a wicked grin, Junebug jumps and spikes the ball so hard that it not only turns into a fireball, but it will pass through weak objects. It now deals 8 damage, but also pinballs off of opponents, dealing 1 less damage to each successive target."

weapon,Esmerelda,Flash of Light,,,"Esmerelda waves her arm, and a bright light flashes across someone. It seems to have a solid form, but it’s gone before you can get a good look at it. Whatever it is, it’s huge. 4 damage melee, can hit up to three adjacent targets. Cracked: Whatever the weapon is, it’s sticking around for longer… It also does 6 damage as Esmerelda laughs creepily. "
weapon,Esmerelda,JUST DIE ALREADY,,,"BROKEN:  In her fury, Esmerelda forgoes all subtlety and tact, and generates claws of shadow to tear into your fucking throat. Damage varies, but tends to be around 8 damage to a single target."
talent,Esmerelda,SpOoOoKy!!!,,,"Esmerelda is a ghost. She can do ghost things. She isn’t all that good at them, but with enough concentration, she can walk through a wall. She can’t gain height all that well, but she can walk across a gap if she focuses. She can’t be invisible for very long, if at all. Creeeepy... - While in Cracked State, She’s a bit better at the ghostly stuff. She doesn’t have to focus on it as hard to walk through a wall, and she can float in a menacing fashion. Oh My God, What The Fuck is THAT!? - In the Broken state, Esmerelda can do most ghostly things easily. She can fly through walls, and can move vertically just as quickly as she can walk. She can also vanish for a round, but doing so has a 2 round cooldown. She doesn’t like to remain invisible for long, so she’ll drop her invisibility on her next turn. "
talent,Esmerelda,...,,,"Esmerelda is dead, and unconsciousness isn’t something that happens with her current… state. When Esmerelda reaches 0 stamina, she simply stops attacking. She no longer responds to outside stimuli, and will just wander at random. You get the feeling(attackme) that targeting her(c’mon,hitme) is a bad idea.(Youknowyouwantto…). It’s not like she’s going to return fire, right?(HITME)... Right?"
passive,Esmerelda,Broken Soul,,,"As combat continues, Esmerelda starts to lose her cool. Every time she takes damage or incurs a stamina cost, the amount is gained as FRACTURE. FRACTURE maxes out at 30. Esmerelda can attempt to calm herself by spending fracture, but this requires a roll, and failing this roll increases FRACTURE by the amount of FRACTURE she would have spent. The ways she can spend FRACTURE include: Once per round, she can modify a roll by up to her current FRACTURE total. On her turn, she can apply a damage modifier to the next attack of an ally or herself, equal to half the FRACTURE spent, rounding down. Once per round, she can spend 5 to give an ally a reroll. This cannot be used in the same round as a roll modifier. On her turn, she can give herself or an ally a speed boost for 1d3 rounds, equal to the amount of FRACTURE she spends. Heheheheeeeeeee… - When Esmerelda reaches 15 FRACTURE, she enters the Cracked State. Overall, she acts in a more violent fashion. All of her abilities gain an additional effect, and her attacks now deal +2 damage. Esmerelda will revert out of Cracked State if she drops below 10 FRACTURE. If using an ability puts her into the Cracked State, the ability uses its Cracked addition. It All Comes Crashing Down… - When Esmerelda reaches 30 FRACTURE, she starts to physically break, turning into a monster, and entering the Broken State. FRACTURE now decreases by one per round, and every 5 damage taken will also decrease FRACTURE by one. Taking damage and stamina costs no longer increase FRACTURE, but dealing 10 or more damage in one turn will increase FRACTURE by one. While in the Broken State, Esmerelda has 8 movement, 1 DR, and all of her abilities are replaced with Broken State versions."
ability,Esmerelda,Light's Warm Embrace,2,,"Esmerelda holds a hand out to a friendly target, before she and the target are surrounded in a heavenly glow. The target is healed by up to about 5. She can use this on herself to heal for 3. She can also reduce the amount of healing in order to heal status conditions. Cracked: If possible, Esmerelda will reach her other hand to an enemy, and drain their lifeforce. Effectively, any healing done to an ally is equal to the damage an enemy takes. Any effects this draining would do to the drainer are applied to Esmerelda, not the friendly target. If used to heal herself, the enemy pays stamina cost as well."
ability,Esmerelda,Darkness’ Chilling Breath,2,,"BROKEN: Esmerelda disappears in a cloud of darkness, which envelops a nearby target. When the smoke clears, the target is covered in wounds and severely rattled. Target takes 9 slashing damage and has a fear effect, where they will try to avoid Esmerelda until either the effect is dispelled, or she reverts out of Broken State. Esmerelda gains half the damage dealt as stamina."
ability,Esmerelda,Lifegiving Glow,2,,"The area around Esmerelda gives off a calming glow. Everyone within 15 feet of Esmerelda heals for 3 at the start of their turns. This has an upkeep of 1, which does not add any FRACTURE. Cracked: While the glow is still calming, there’s now a menacing aura to it. Everyone within feels on-edge at all times. Allies have a +3 to reactionary anytimes while in this area. Enemies will feel compelled to get away from her, since she is so damn creepy."
ability,Esmerelda,Deadly Shadow,2,,"BROKEN: The area around Esmerelda starts to turn sinister, which scares everyone around her. Anyone within 15 feet of her gains a fear effect. This causes all allies to deal +1 damage, and all enemies to take +1 damage. This modifier does not apply to herself. If Lifegiving Glow is active when Esmerelda enters the broken state, it is converted to Deadly Shadow. The upkeep is the same one stamina per round. If Esmerelda leaves the Broken State while Deadly Shadow is active, it becomes Lifegiving Glow."
ability,Esmerelda,I Will Protect You,X,,"A glowing green light floats out of Esmerelda, which then stretches to surround an ally. When that ally would take damage, Esmerelda's veil takes it instead. The veil will protect an ally from any attack, but will dissipate if it takes damage equal to or greater than the amount of stamina spent on this ability. If the veil takes a significant amount of damage past the amount of stamina Esmerelda put into it, then some of the damage will bleed over to the target. Half of all damage dealt to the veil is added to Esmerelda as FRACTURE. Cracked: Half of all damage dealt to the veil is dealt back to the attacker. The veil has splashes of darkness now, instead of being a soft green light."

ability,Esmerelda,Time to Cool Off,1,,"Esmerelda lets out some ghostly energy to chill the area around them. She can use this to put out fires, freeze water, stuff like that. She can also make constructs of ice, though they usually aren’t all that big. Cracked: patches of darkness appear in the ice she creates, and while this doesn’t do a lot mechanically, anything she makes that’s used to deal damage does more than it would normally."
ability,Esmerelda,F R E E Z E,3,,"Black ice shoots out from where Esmerelda is, coating whatever surface she is touching, up to a 4x4 area. Any unit in this area when the effect is activated immediately takes 4 damage and is stuck to the spot. On their turn, they have to roll to break out of the ice. Anybody passing over the ice has to roll to keep their balance. If they fail the roll, they fall over and lose the rest of the movement action they were using. Esmerelda can instead choose to use this on a specific target, causing them to be coated in ice, and chilled to their core. This will do about 6 damage while also freezing them in place. On their turns, they make a thaw check. If they fail the check twice, they automatically thaw on their next turn. If an ally can provide a source of heat, the target can immediately make an advantaged thaw check. Any heat based attack can thaw them immediately, but it deals a little extra damage due to the sudden temperature change. While frozen, they cannot move, but can still act with a higher chance of failing actions that don’t lead to thawing them."
ability,Esmerelda,This Isn’t Me! That’s Not Who I am!,X FRACTURE !,,"Esmerelda realizes that she’s doing some bad shit. She panics for a bit before forcing the violent actions down, strengthening her resolve. She either heals herself by the amount of FRACTURE spent, or gives herself DR for 1d3 rounds equal to half the FRACTURE spent. She can only use this ability when she has 10 or more FRACTURE. The DC for this ability is equal to the amount of FRACTURE she spends, and she has to spend at least 5."
ability,Esmerelda,This Isn’t Meheheheee! That’s Not Who I am! Ahahaha...,X FRACTURE !,,"CRACKED: Esmerelda knows she should force down the darkness. It has to be held at bay! People could get hurt…? Esmerelda attempts to hold herself together by unleashing her FRACTURE in a damaging way. She grabs an opponent, and forces the FRACTURE through their body. Doing so causes them to take damage equal to the FRACTURE spent. The roll becomes harder the more FRACTURE Esmerelda has, and if the attack fails for any reason, she gains 5 FRACTURE."
ability,Esmerelda,This is how I’m meant to be!,X FRACTURE !,,"Esmerelda GROWLS, before her claws glow a bright purple. She can spend FRACTURE to boost all damage, given and taken, by the amount she spends. This lasts for 1d3+1 rounds."

He can immediately follow up with a weapon strike if he does this, but it does half damage if it isn't used on his turn. Once per round."
weapon,Fyira,Pyromancy,,,"Fyira can create and control fire, there isn’t too much in the way of limits as to what he can make and/or control when it comes to fire. This of course can make the damage, range and area affected vary wildly depending on what he does with it but generally he will be dealing 5-9 damage to one or more targets at up to 15 spaces away. This will always inflict a burn so long as it hits a unit that can be burned."
weapon,Fyira,BurnOut,,,"Fyira’s claws. Not much in the way of use for these exactly, what with the pyromancy normally, but they deal a mean 7 damage at 2 range and on rolls of 13+ either create a 2x2 of area flames within 2 spaces of him or the target OR inflicts them with a “Seared Wound” that inflicts 2d4 burning damage at the start of each of the afflicted units turns and requires two 14+ resist rolls to fully clear (each one lowering the amount of die rolled when the burn inflicts damage). Multiple inflictions of this at once increase the amount of dice rolled for the damage but decreases the DC to clear."
talent,Fyira,Thermally Empowered,,,"If Fyira is within a source of heat (such as fire or an entire volcano), once per turn, he may use one of his abilities or basic attacks as a swift action. While in “Overheat” he may pick a second basic attack or ability to use as a swift action and gains a second swift action on each of his turns."
talent,Fyira,Cooldown To Heat Up,,,"Fyira can choose to spend accumulated “Heat” to gain damage or roll modifiers on his actions at a 1 Heat to +2 to rolls or damage ratio (1:2). If he spends them at a 2:1 ratio instead, these are natural modifiers (meaning they can cancel crit fails and grant crit successes). Regardless of how he spends Heat, he may do it after seeing the roll."
talent,Fyira,Type Balancing,,,"Fyira, like most of the oldest generation of Glitchlings, is somewhat weak to his counter element. When Fyira is struck by Cold based damage, the user of the attack can choose to either multiply the damage dealt to Fyira by 1.5x rounding up or reduce his Heat Points by an amount equal to half of the damage (rounding down minimum 1). This cannot send his Heat into the negatives."
passive,Fyira,Overheat,,,"When Fyira is in the presence of sources of heat, his red stat starts to raise appropriately. Basically, if he is hit with a heat-based attack, stands close enough to fire, submerges himself in lava, etc, he gains variable amounts of Heat. For every turn on initiative he is in an area that is of extreme heat he gain 1 Heat, he naturally gains 1 heat at the start of each of his turns, any heat based damage he takes or would normally is converted into heat (1:1) and if he takes 8 or more damage at once from any source half of it is converted into Heat (rounding up). When Fyira reaches 10 Heat his body starts to burn hotter and hotter as he enters Overheat. For the next round, Fyira’s movement is tripled, he can move-act-move and all of his fire powers become intensely enhanced. Fyira’s enhanced fire powers can not be interrupted and become a lot harder to block, in addition they deal at minimum 1.5x the normal damage. In addition, any fire or heat based maneuvers that Fyira performs while in Overheat ignores resistances and lowers immunities to resistances, when someone would heal via heat and fire it is reduced to ¼ effectiveness (rounding up). Once Overheat ends all of Fyira’s accumulated “Heat” dissipates."
passive,Fyira,Dunno If You’ve Noticed But…,,,"Fyira cannot be hurt by fire or heat. if an attack is pure fire, like a fireball, he'd only take small damage from the impact, not the fire. He also cannot be afflicted with burn status’ and other heat based status’ instead give him relative amounts of “Heat”."
ability,Fyira,Embodiment Of Flame!,2!,,"Fyira commands heat and flame as though his own body, he can stop and control any fire, heat or flame based actions as he sees fit. If an action is only partially one of those things, and controlled by an enemy, the original user rolls off for control with Fyira rolling with advantage. Twice Per Round."
ability,Fyira,Burning Soul,3,,"Summon a flame elemental. It has 10 stamina, a 4 damage 8 range attack that inflicts burn and 6 movement. Any heat based attacks or action heal the elementals. If an enemy willingly and physically touches a flame elemental they take 3 backlash damage."
ability,Fyira,Flare Ultima,5⛯,,"Fyira has had enough of your shit. He begins to pool all of his power into one powerful attack. This attack does damage in a 3xInfinite area equal to Fyira's current Heat Points, spending them all in the process. If this deals 20 or more damage to a single unit it is Once per combat."
ability,Fyira,Worms for the Wyrms,3,,"Fyira summons one of his wyrms. Each wyrm has its own stat totals, two abilities, and a basic attack. Each Wyrm can only be summoned once per combat and just disappear if they are KO’d rather than being killed."
ability,Fyira,The Crispy Dib!,2,,"Fyira places his claws to the ground and starts to chip and char the very earth. This creates a 9x9 area of difficult terrain centred on himself, every enemy in the area when this is created starts to feel their own body’s heat up and become almost charred and charcoal-like. This doesn’t deal any damage but afflicts the “Crispy” status that forces all ability costs to be increased by 1, forces enemies to pay 1 stamina when they move, removes any form of DR they have and finally reduces their durability vs heat and/or fire based damage (increasing it to 1.5x rounding down). This area only lasts until the start of Fyira’s next turn but “Crispy'' lasts until it is cleared. Not an anytime, but can only be used once per round."
weapon,Dodger,Dagger Claw,,,"Dodger with its quick feet and quicker wit, darts up to a target within their movement and stabs them twice for 4 damage. This can be done mid-movement."

weapon,Eruption,Wyrm Breath,,,"Perhaps the most standard of the three, Eruption breathes a 5 range cone of searing flame that deals 8 damage to everyone inside. This always leaves a burn if it hits a target."
ability,Eruption,Wing Beat,3,,"Eruption’s mighty wings let loose and create a gust of hot air in a 5x9 in front of it. This deals 3 damage to all it hits, but if there is any flame in the area at all this damage is tripled and leaves the area scorched, becoming difficult terrain and dealing 3 fire damage to anyone who starts their turns, enters or leaves this area once per round for 1 round. Can not be used multiple rounds in a row."
ability,Eruption,Fireball,2,,"Not the most imaginative attack normally but Eruption makes use of its magnificent tail, swiping it to cover up to 4 spaces away on one of Eruption’s sides, dealing 3 damage to all enemies caught and catapulting the fireball at greater speeds making it harder to interact with. The fireball deals 8 damage at 10 range."

ability,Princess,Blasting Powder,2,,Princess starts pounding at the ground with its forearms and pushes up 1d3 powder stones boulders in places within 3 spaces of itself. These powder stones will explode if they take a big enough hit for 5 fire/physical damage to all units within 2 spaces of it. Only Princess is completely immune to this detonation.

talent,Bingo,Past Transgressions,,,Bingo has learned from the mistakes of their ancestors and is immune to fire based attacks.
passive,Bingo,Living Airship,,,"Due to Bingo Blimp’s blimp anatomy, they are usually filled with a large amount of helium. Therefore, they are able to take their movement action in any direction they desire, enabling them to fly and avoid making checks to jump around environmental obstacles. They start off with 100 Helium in their Red Stat, and every time they end a turn while off the ground they lose 10. The lower Bingo’s Helium Stat is, the harder it is to fly, and reaching zero disables flight capabilities. If Bingo wants to recharge helium, they can spend either a movement action or regular action to gain 10, or both to gain 20."
ability,Bingo,Threaten' Zepplin,3,,"Bingo’s gondola opens and drops a giant bomb! Ooh, explosive! Deals 7-12 damage in a 4x4 area with Bingo as its center. If Bingo desires, they can designate an element that explodes out of the bomb, such as fire, ice, or electricity."

weapon,Streggo,From Suck to Blow,,,"Dr. Streggo gives into reckless abandon and fires a random fossil out of the Jurassic Pack. Deals 4 damage with 3 range, and on rolls 15 or higher, may inflict a status/effect based on the fossil type that was fired."
talent,Streggo,Pack Protection!,,,"Any attacks that target Streggo from behind deal half damage, and cause a fossil to immediately shoot out at the attacker in retaliation. This counterattack counts as a basic attack but without range restriction. If Streggo is to be knocked out from an attack, he can perform a once per round anytime to turn himself around so The Jurassic Pack takes the blow. When doing this, he acts as cover for anyone in front of him."
passive,Streggo,The Jurassic Pack,,,"Dr. Streggo always has his handy dandy fossil extracter/holder on his back at all times: The Jurassic Pack. Not only is it what makes him a heavyset build, but it also has a load of fossils Streggo has discovered during his studies. There are 10 types overall, and things that require use of them roll d10s to determine which ones are used. The list consists of: 1. The legs of a big, t-rex like dinosaur. 2. Sharp, dragonfly like wings that produce electricity 3. The shell of some kind of ancient Coleoptera, which secretes a sticky substance. 4. The bottom half of a gigantic, whale like creature. 5. The head of a wooly mammoth with icicle tusks. 6. Chicken head, whose comb ignites into flame for some reason. 7. Big snake head with poison in pretty much every inch of its body. 8. Neanderthal Body with an ancient...video game controller? 9. Brain of a psychic monkey. 10. Just a whole ass sabretooth tiger. 23. Research Mission 1: Complete! Pick 5 of these fossils to add to the Jurassic Pack’s list: The arm of a gigantic (5x5) monkey creature. An evil dinosaur head with devil horns that mocks you when you come in contact with it. A human like skull that turns everything within 10 ft of it into a gelatinous substance of some kind. A nearly withered, yet very effective leaf that can act as either a power generator or a healing device. Massive hercules beetle horn. 5 - Ehhh, Can We Call That One A Mulligan? For each ability/action of Streggo’s that requires him to roll on his Fossil List, he can call for a reroll once during a session. If he goes an entire session without calling for a mulligan, he gains +2 Proficiency."
ability,Streggo,Dinosaur Revival Concert,3,,"Dr. Streggo somehow found a way to revitalize long dead fossils, but let’s not worry about that for now. Most of his fossils aren’t complete though, so he’s just gonna mix them up and see how it goes. Roll 3 fossils from The Jurassic Pack, and reroll one of the results if all three numbers are the same. From there, the “creature” is now revived with as much or as little as the combination may give it, and it acts as a summon that Streggo can control. When using this ability, he can pay 2 additional stamina to add another fossil into the mix, but the more times he does this, the more likely it is that the creature will gain enough awareness to betray the good doctor. Only one of these creatures can be on the field at a time."
ability,Streggo,Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks,1,,"Roll 2d10 on the fossil list and pick one. Congrats! You’ve now partially revived that fossil and can graft it onto an adjacent person of your choice, giving them/inflicting an effect based it onto them! Fuck it, dinosaur leg time. 9. IT’S ALIIIIVE!! - Dr. Streggo can now use Teaching A New Dog Old Tricks on adjacent objects other than people, or even himself! If a fossil is grafted onto something without life, and the fossil is more of a supplementary part (wings, legs, shells, etc), the creature tends to have lower stamina than average."
ability,Streggo,Dino Radar,3⛯,,"What’s that, Dr. Streggo’s Dino Radar is going off? Well we better go check what it’s saying. What’s that, there’s a dinosaur crawling up from the ground trying to reclaim the remains of its brethren? Uh oh. Fortunately, Dr. Streggo practiced workplace safety and kept his radar on him, so he managed to take another movement action and run away. However, in a 3x3 area centered on where he was standing, a dinosaur pops up and makes the space a “Dino Zone”. Anyone in a “Dino Zone” takes 10-20 dinosaur bite damage upon initial entrance, and 4-7 at the start of their turns if they do not roll higher than an opposing “Dino Check” from Streggo. Once per combat. 17. Persistent Perusal - When a Dino Zone from Dino Radar is active, paying another 3 stamina as a bonus action will cause the dinos to notice that Streggo has evaded capture (for now) and move over to his current location.

But on high rolls or crits they get the best damn fish imaginable. Fish can be used for anything they want but can also be traded to Duke for in-game bonuses like modifiers on rolls, extra stamina, DR or anything else they can think of. It’s dependent on the fish quality and lasts till the end of combat. 10 - Fishing Minigame - Nice Catch! Anyone who successfully fishes and hands in fish to Duke Tackle gets extra bonuses.

passive,Edith,Scale Model,,,"Edith loves to build little models that she displays in her windows, her attention to detail draws in lots of praise from passerby’s. This instills lots of confidence within her, essentially boosting her rolls whenever she is building one. Since Edith spends combat making models, she gets a +1 to her rolls for having more than 3 models active at once, and a +1 to for every extra model added afterwards. (ex. 5 models would yield a +2). On a Roll - The turn after Edith’s passive activates she is able to place down 2 models per action.

ability,Edith,Up and Around,1,,"Edith places down a replica of the local ferris wheel, because of the limitations of the 2D top-down viewing experience offered by Roll20 this ferris wheel kinda looks like it's on its side so its effect will also be like that. After placing this down the wheel will spin and rotate any players adjacent to it on Edith’s turn to one space in a clockwise rotation.

ability,Ebino,Jade Carapace,1!,,"The clothes that Ebino wears are not made of normal mortal fibers, instead they are a loose complex of chitosan and jade that can be hardened by Ebi’s will.

ability,Ebino,10 Limbs of Heaven,3,,"Mimicking the great heavenly beast, Ebino can take a multitude of sword stances that imbue him with holy power. This power can manifest in several ways, but after being cast down from heaven he has only regained access to 4 stances: 3 Pleopods and 1 Pereiopod. Ebino can take on a Pleopod and Pereiopod stance at the same time, and can drop one or both at any time without rolling. 1st Pleopod: Stomatopoda - Ebino takes a low stance, concentrating all his power into one single point, with a swift motion he forces the hilt of his Kusanebi downwards with a strike that deals 8 damage. This strike can also break shields or DR by dealing half damage. 3rd Pleopod: Alpheidae - Ebino creates tension in his spine and forces his Kusanebi upwards still in its sheath, then quickly drops low and repeats the action catching the blade. The speed of this action causes the sound to reverberate inside the sheath until he next draws the blade as an anytime. This deals 1 damage at .5 range per turn the sword is kept sheathed, but it can only be sheathed until his turn the next round. 5th Pleopod: Penaeidae - Ebino focuses on a piece of the local environment, covers his vision of it with his hands, and closes his fists. This forces the environmental aspect to accumulate into a new form that acts as a benefit towards him. (ex. Heat loosens his muscles making him faster/stronger). 4th Pereiopod: Anostraca - Ebino’s body becomes greatly attuned to the gravity wells of everything around it, allowing him to manipulate them into giving him free gravitational control centered on him. This basically lets him do controlled falling in any direction he wishes. He cannot fly with this ability but he falls at his base movement speed and can change the direction of his gravity at will once per round. "

In extreme cases (giant items, uber plot important shit, instakill items) the GM may decide to increase the cost, however, this should only be done SPARINGLY.

weapon,Harvey,Pedal Pump Boots,,,"Your boots have been modified to have large compartments, making them really big platform shoes, it looks kinda weird, but you spend all day in the machinery so nobody really sees them.

ability,DeVrosky,Medical History,3,,"Leon has a pocketwatch he keeps on him at all times that he pretends to not be noteworthy or important, but it has the ability to check...Various things about people. He may check his watch to see the “Medical History” of whoever is within 5 spaces. This makes him enter a scene of the target's most recent point of being injured by another person...Or themselves. Leon may walk around freely and make alterations to the scene, which affect the future as though the events that unfolded always happened. "
ability,DeVrosky,Scientific Method,3,,"Being on the capture duty, Leon has reverse engineered plenty of experiments. When he captures one, he may add another use to this ability, an invention relating to the abilities of the captured experiment. When this ability is chosen, he may also choose ability functions based off the 2 already captured experiments. Current Uses: - A scanner that records the weight of an object, it can then be set to firing mode to alter the weight of what it hits to make it of equal weight to the recorded mass.

Slightly."

This will continue to happen until the number of spawned Gremlins equals half his current proficiency rounded down. Rolling a 1 on summoning means you have to wait a round to respawn. Each new Gremlin has the inventory of the one that just died.

talent,Grimald,King Pin Bowling,,,"When the shadows of multiple targets are adjacent to each other, any attacks Grimald performs against one will knock it into the others, dealing half the damage of the attack to the shadows caster rounding up. If a target has multiple shadows they each deal damage separately and can be split to hit different targets."
passive,Grimald,Void Out,,,"The space Grimald occupies is always completely void of electromagnetic energies and all forms of radiation because he absorbs them passively.

weapon,Avery,Abyss Cardinal,,,A scythe that Avery can make from the odd metal shards that make up parts of her arm. Can cleave 2 spaces for 3 damage each.
talent,Avery,Cuts - Between,,,"At the start of combat, Avery marks a singular space in combat. Moving through that space takes .5 of a space of movement instead of a full space."
passive,Avery,A Spirit on the Battlefield,,,"Avery, due to her unique state, is as much a sortof ‘spirit’ as she is a human. She can freely move past enemies, dealing 2 damage the first time she passes through an enemy in a turn, and 1 damage the second time. Avery may also move, act, move."
ability,Avery,Side-Line,2,,"A shadowy ghost manifests where Avery started her turn and goes through the exact path she took, dealing 5 damage to everyone it passes through, optionally teleporting to any tile across or adjacent to her path. If she pays 1 extra, she may deal 2 damage in a line from where she came from to where she is without needing to roll anything else."
ability,Avery,Precipice of Death,4,,"Avery raises her scythe and forces all of the metal within her body - blood stream and otherwise - all into this one executioner’s blow. It rolls a D4, dealing 4 damage if it’s 1-3, and 27 if it rolls a 4. Once per Four Rounds."
ability,Avery,The Shadow's Judgement,2,,"Upon using an ability, this rolls with a +2, however must be used to follow up an action. Avery dashes 2 spaces in any direction and reaps everywhere around her for 4 damage to everyone adjacent to her, healing 1 for everyone hit. She cannot be adversely affected by using this ability by anytimes (eg. she may not be damaged while using it.)"
weapon,Din,Gevurah,,,"Din’s signature weapon, a katana with a red silk ribbon looped to the bottom of the hilt. Using the Iaido fighting style, this weapon has base stats of 6 damage at 1 range. However, when attacking Din can trade out damage for range at a 1:1 conversion rate. Hitting with an odd roll number on this weapon also applies a stack of Burn, which causes the target to pay an additional stamina on all abilities for a couple rounds for each stack. All burn stacks disappear after a couple rounds, but their decay rate is refreshed when another stack is reapplied. 49: +3 weapon damage."
talent,Din,"Bruh I Beat You, It’s Mine Now",,,"Whenever Din defeats an enemy, that target loses their class name and Din adds it onto his own. 51: Whenever Din defeats someone with powers relating to an “element”, he can kinda just decide to “take their gimmick” so to speak and use it as a trophy. This lets Din come into his next session with another set of magic versions to his abilities. And YES, he also gets a dog to commemorate the occasion. Can only trigger once per session."
talent,Din,Immense Pressure,,,"Anyone of class 2 or higher can immediately sense an insane amount of power originating from you even over large distances. It is genuinely fucking stunning. I understand that this does literally nothing helpful for you and actively reveals your location but, like, no biggie."
passive,Din,Son of Prometheus,,,"Considering Din’s natural affinity for fire, he can simply create the Hellfire versions of some of his skills by unsheathing his sword fast enough that it becomes red hot, not paying the additional stamina in the process. Still does not allow him to stack Hellfire on top of different magic types. In addition, the Hellfire version of Divine Form is a bonus action and not once per combat."
passive,Din,Not Worth Getting Up For This,,,"Din’s skills allow him to easily ignore weaker opponents, automatically dodging all attacks and effects that are traditionally dodgeable made by targets whose proficiency is less than half of his own, unless the action crits. You can also choose to not enter combat when everyone first rolls initiative, being able to move and act freely outside of turn order so long as you don’t use any abilities, weapons, or any other statistical effects. While like this you automatically dodge all attacks that are dodgeable instead of just those at a certain prof level. Din can choose to enter combat at any time. (obviously disabled for PvP, since Din would at least humor his enemies by taking their blows in a fair duel) Stored Power - For each turn (not round) you spend not in combat, you begin to store points in a red stat. Once you finally join that combat, Din’s rolls will gain a boost equal to the red stat stored, capped at +3. However, you also lose red stat equal to the boost gained each time it’s used. Effectively this acts as stored power that is released over time once combat is joined."
ability,Din,Fragments of Sky,3,,"Din quickly pulls and re-sheathes Gevurah, leaving a slash in the air. This slash occupies 4 spaces, and its shape can be freely determined by Din so long as each space is adjacent to one another and at least one space is within 2 range of Din himself. If these are placed directly on enemies, they immediately damage them for 3 damage each. However, if there is no one within that range the area stays, and will automatically trigger whenever an enemy enters the area, dealing 6 damage instead. If you rolled a 16 or higher on this ability, you can immediately use this ability again, up to a maximum of three uses in a turn. You have to repay the stamina cost for each one. Also when using this ability, Din can choose to channel a different magical element through his sword to augment the attacks at the cost of an additional stamina cost paid. You can only pick one of these effects per usage: -Hellfire - Targets hit gain a burn stack (as described in your basic weapon). -Galeforce - Targets hit are all knocked in one direction of your choosing 2 spaces. -Frostbane - The area that this takes up is coated in stalagtites of ice, making them wall-like obstacles. -Sparklash - Targets’ reflexes are jolted, making them roll disadvantage on anytimes for this round. -Blackwake - The areas act as barriers of sight that cannot be seen or even heard past, meaning that people don’t know what’s happening on the other side of them. This also affects your teammates, but not yourself."
ability,Din,Over Here,1!,,"Din vanishes with extreme speed before reappearing directly next to another person. He then taps on them with the hilt of his sword, which despite lacking in speed flings them up to 5 spaces in the opposite direction. Note that this repositioning does not cancel the target’s move if they were performing one, it simply relocates both you and them. Once per round."
ability,Din,"Good Boy, Milton!",2,,"Din has actual goddamn dogs as pets, and he’s trained them well. With this ability, he summons a 5 stamina 6 movement 5 damage 1 range bite basic attack doggo! Also when using this ability, Din can choose to channel a different magical element through his dog whistle, which calls over a different dog at the cost of an additional stamina cost paid. You can only pick one of these effects per usage. In total you have six dogs, one normal and five representing the five different elements. Each one can only be summoned once per session.: -Hellfire - Dante, who’s your loyal hunting dog. His attack has 5 range as it is a fireball projectile which deals Burn stacks on odd rolls. -Galeforce - Beatrice, a very noble doggo. Can fly. -Frostbane - Speare, your elegant guard dog. Enemies cannot approach it to be adjacent due to the icy walls that form in response, they must wait for Speare to do so. -Sparklash - Virgil, your first dog. Wields as sword that deals 5 damage at 2 range, and has +1 movement compared to your other dogs. -Blackwake - Poe, who’s one beautiful mastiff. Gets a dodge roll against all non-light attacks by phasing through."
ability,Din,Divine Form,1⛯,,"Din channels a magic element of his choice into himself, entering a boosted state. Choose Hellfire, Galeforce, Frostbane, Sparklash, or Blackwake. Using that elemental version of your abilities doesn’t cost extra stamina in this form. You also gain heavy resistance to fire, wind, ice, electric, or darkness damage respectively. You also get a buff based on which element you choose. However, this form only lasts for three rounds. Once per combat. -Hellfire - All of your attacks inflict Burn on odd rolls. -Galeforce - +3 movement. -Frostbane - +1 physical DR. Melee attacks that fail end up being partially frozen, reducing their damage by 2 for the rest of combat. -Sparklash - All your attacks deal an additional 2 damage to all tiles adjacent to where they struck. -Blackwake - You appear invisible in shade and shadowed areas."
ability,Din,Touga Hyojin,2,,"Din performs a quick slash that creates a projectile-like wave effect as the force of the attack cuts the air in front of it. This deals 4 damage at 8 range and can pierce through targets at the cost of halving its damage upon each pass rounded up. If you rolled a 16 or higher on this ability, you can immediately use this ability again, up to a maximum of three uses in a turn. Also when using this ability, Din can choose to channel a different magical element through his sword to augment the attacks at the cost of an additional stamina cost paid. You can only pick one of these effects per usage: Hellfire - Targets hit gain a burn stack (as described in your basic weapon). Galeforce - Damage now scales by decreasing by 1 instead of being halved when piercing. Frostbane - The projectile creates a sheet of ice along the ground which causes those running across it to move at double speed, but those moving from one side to the other to roll or slip over and lose movement. Sparklash - Targets hit are shook by the blast, getting -2 movement for this round. Blackwake - Targets hit feel a malaise that gives their rolls this round a -3."
weapon,Gen,Blader,,,"A uniquely-shaped longsword that was one of Elin's weapons of choice in life. This is the same sword she used, and is the only sword that feels right in Gen's hand. 5 Damage 1 Range."
weapon,Gen,Cross,,,"An energy-based hand crossbow that was Elin's other weapon of choice in life. This is the same hand crossbow she used, and is the only other weapon that feels right in Gen's hands. After firing, it can't be used for a round as it automatically reloads. Quick Reload - If Cross is currently reloading but needs to be used for a basic attack or ability, Gen can spend 1 stamina to immediately reload it as a free action."
talent,Gen,Phantom Walker,,,"Using his half-ghost heritage and some help from Elin, Gen can more or less freely jump between the material plane and the phantom plane, where ghosts and spirits reside. This requires spending an action in combat, however while in the phantom plane Gen can interact with ghosts and spirits as if they were fully corporeal. Furthermore, Gen is treated like a ghost while in the phantom plane, meaning most people can’t interact with him, and likewise he can’t interact with them."
passive,Gen,Eleena Figatura,,,"The soul of the previous owner of the outcast epithet, its true power has come forth after communing with Gen. Any and all skills and general knowledge that Elin possessed in her lifetime are transferred to Gen, including her combat ability. The only real limit to this is Elin’s significantly limited memory, and Gen’s physical ability. Elin is always around Gen, but cannot be targeted and doesn’t have her own stamina pool. She is dead, after all, and after being cast out of pretty much every possible afterlife there isn’t exactly anywhere else for her soul to go. Because of how their souls are linked, if Gen goes down in combat then Elin similarly will go down and become unconscious. Linked Fighters - Despite being a soul trapped in the ethereal plane, after communing with Gen Elin can physically interact with and use Blader & Cross. As such, aside from Gen’s basic attack, every one of Gen’s abilities essentially has two parts: one performed by Gen and the other by Elin. Every time one of these abilities is used two rolls must be made, one for each part, applying to the order that they happen in. Generally speaking, if at least one of them succeeds at their part the ability mostly works, though it might have some slightly reduced damage, or lose a part of its effect. Also, if one of them crits then the entire action is treated as a crit, regardless of the other roll."
ability,Gen,Spring Leaves,3,,"Elin rushes forward up to 5 spaces with Blader and launches up to 4 enemies adjacent to her (She can be physically on top of one) into the air while dealing 1 damage to each, as Gen takes aim and fires 4 targeted shots from Cross. Each shot deals 3 damage, and they spread out evenly between the available targets. If 3 enemies are launched only 3 shots come out, but they each deal 4 damage instead, and if one enemy is launched, each of the four shots only deals 2 damage. In either case, each target is also launched back 3 spaces from the force of the shots hitting them while airborne."
ability,Gen,Autumn Petals,2,,"Gen lunges forward 4 spaces, Blader outstretched, dealing 4 damage to a target he can reach after those 4 spaces and pushing them back 1 space. Elin then immediately follows up as Gen hands Blader to her, appearing directly in front of Gen and slashing an arc in front of her. This deals 4 damage to every enemy in that arc (normally the 3 spaces in front and adjacent to her, and the space on each of her sides). If the enemy can't be moved (or Gen chooses to), then Gen will instead jump a space back and the enemy won't be knocked back."
ability,Gen,Winter Sun,3,,"Elin and Gen line up together, both holding onto Cross, as they combine their power and charge up to fire a powerful blast of energy. This blast affects a 1xInfinite area, dealing 8 damage to the first target hit, 4 to the next one, and 2 to every target after that."
ability,Gen,Summer Moon,3,,"Elin fires Cross into Blader, infusing it with energy as Gen swings in a quick sweeping motion. This ability deals 6 damage in a 2 space radius around Gen to enemies, and applies a stunning effect to any enemies hit that applies disadvantage to their next roll."
weapon,Lila,Claws of Darkness,,,"Lila’s favorite general form for her shadowrealm powers is the form of two giant claws, sprouting out of her back. (17 Prof) ‘Claws Of Darkness’ has its range increased by 2. 26 Prof: Additional Claws Of Darkness unlocked! Lila now has four Claws Of Darkness to use with her attacks or abilities."
weapon,Lila,Abyssal Tentacles,,,"Tentacles rise from below the abyss, attacking and wrapping around chosen targets. Any target hit is restrained and pulled to the origin point of the tentacles, and they must make a roll to escape on their turn if they wish to move. Can reach up to 2 range outside of the Dark Abyss."
talent,Lila,Loyal Protector,,,"While he might not be the most stable mentally or physically, that doesn’t change the fact that Lila is pretty much the only person in the world that Streak will obey, to the point that he even makes an effort to ensure Lila’s safety when possible. Once per session when Lila would be knocked below 0 stamina, she is instead only reduced to 1 stamina as Streak appears from seemingly nowhere, taking the rest of the damage. Streak will then remain in battle for 1 round or until combat is over, acting on Lila’s turn in place of her. Once he leaves, if combat hasn’t ended then Lila gets healed for 10 stamina. Also, Streak's primary purpose in this instance is protecting Lila over anything else, so he won't use some of his more powerful effects unless absolutely necessary."
passive,Lila,Shadowrealm Pact,,,"Lila possesses a pure black gemstone, gifted to her by her late father. Little did Lila know, this gemstone contains a deep, soul-bonded contract that gives the wearer shadowrealm-esque powers, assuming the wearer meets certain genetic requirements. This gemstone is what allows Lila to use pretty much all of her kit, if it is ever removed from her it will be automatically returned to her after a round at most, and simply possessing it gives Lila resistance to all mental effects, and general resistance to any shadowrealm-based powers."
ability,Lila,Dark Possession,1,,"Lila can detach the shadow claws sprouting out of her back, and direct them to possess a target’s weapon. So long as the weapon is possessed, when the target attacks with their weapon Lila can direct them to attack with it again, performing the same action at a target of Lila’s choice in range. After using the effect once the possession ends and the claw returns to Lila. Up to two possessions can be active at once, but if two are active then Lila loses access to her basic attack until one of the charges is returned. (14 Prof) Let Me Borrow This If You Don’t Mind - When Lila uses ‘Dark Possession’ on a weapon, she can choose to immediately attack with that weapon instead of waiting for the target to use it. If she does so, she must pay 1 additional Stamina, but she’s able to make the weapon float somewhat up to 3 spaces away from the original target to give it a wider range of attack. These floating weapons are returned to the owner after the attack is made. Particularly powerful or complex weapons will likely require additional Stamina to do this with. She can only use this additional effect once per combat per weapon it’s used on."
ability,Lila,Shadow Puppets,1,,"Lila separates a portion of the shadow stored in her gem, creating 2-3 small shadow puppets that obey her command and act on her turn. These generally can’t deal damage unless they all focus on a single target, and they can be made to take just about any animal form, so long as the animal is sufficiently small (Lila particularly likes using birds). Lila may also temporarily expend one of her shadow claws to make a full size summon, with 8 stamina and a 4 damage 1 range basic attack. Aside from being larger and only summoning one, these otherwise function exactly like the small summons. 19 prof: Flexible Shadows - When Lila creates a larger summon than usual with ‘Shadow Puppets’ she is now able to customize the statistics of the summon to her liking by choosing one of the options below. 10 Stamina, 3 damage 1 range basic attack. 8 Stamina, 4 damage 1 range basic attack. 5 Stamina, 5 damage 2 range basic attack. In addition, once per session Lila can choose to give a particular summon a name. If she does so, then in the future, summoning that particular named creature will have a +2 bonus to succeeding and it can slowly get stronger over time the more it’s used in combat. However, each named creature can only be summoned once per combat and the cost to summon them increases as their level of strength does."
ability,Lila,The Dark Abyss,3⛯,,"Lila expends basically all of her shadow powers to create a 5x5 area on the ground of pure shadow, with Lila at the center. So long as Lila remains in this area, any enemies within have halved movement, take 3 damage at the beginning of their turns, and are considered in range of her basic attack, which is changed slightly while this is active. As a downside, however, Lila cannot leave the area once it has been formed, as she is now essentially a part of the abyss she created, though she may remove it as a free action on her turn. Once per combat. 24: The Darkest Depths - The abyss Lila creates with ‘The Darkest Abyss’ now deals 5 damage to enemies when they start their turns in the area, and when she initially creates the area, she can choose a number of targets up to the number of Claws Of Darkness she has to spare, and those targets are pulled 4 spaces closer to her in the abyss. She can also spend additional Stamina to pull targets even closer if she wishes, the cost is 1 Stamina per two extra spaces that targets are pulled."
ability,Lila,Shadestep,2!,,"Tendrils of darkness gather around Lila before she seems to suddenly fade into shadow and appear somewhere else up to 6 spaces away. This can dodge attacks and escape most physical restraints. If she has one of her ‘Claws Of Darkness’ available, she can immediately attack a target in range of her after the teleport is completed, but if she does so, that claw will be considered unavailable until the end of Lila’s next turn."
weapon,Vadyra,[Another Attempt At Making A Portmanteau of Punch and Puncture that Sounds Good],,,"Around Vadyra’s forearm, spikes appear that she pierces into an adjacent target for 4 damage, which hurt like hell, ignoring forms of DR. Vadyra may choose to not let go, putting the target in a grappled state where she can try to make them move less on her turn, or move along with them."
talent,Vadyra,Battle God,,,"Vadyra, Once per Session, can sprout another pair of arms for 2 rounds which she has perfect control of. When she uses her basic attack, she may use it 3 additional times, as well as making all of her abilities slightly more effective with the addition of yet more arms. She doesn’t only use this for combat."
talent,Vadyra,;),,,"If Vadyra manages to put the moves on someone successfully, she gains +1 proficiency. Additionally, for every unique person in a combat who is generally considered ‘hot,’ ‘cute,’ or otherwise attractive, she gets a plus one bonus she can put between rolls, movement, or a temporary stamina shield which refills at the start of her turn. There is a max of +3 to rolls and +4 to movement. The temporary stamina shield can let her act as though she were still conscious if she has stamina over 0."
passive,Vadyra,Battle Rage,,,"Vadyra’s epithet allows her to be truly in sync with her emotions. As her health gets lower, her determination and fury burn brighter as well! Depending on the amount of health she’s at, her abilities get different effects. If she reaches the following thresholds of health, she goes to that “Mode,” which will be called White, Yellow, Orange and Red for ease of use. Even if healed, Vadyra cannot go up in a mode. If an ability brings her below a threshold, it acts as though the previous threshold also applied. 100% - Not yet in the heat of the battle, Vadyra simply wishes to test her opponents mettle for the time being, being a bit more playful. She has a passive 2DR against blunt physical attacks in this form. 75% - Vadyra’s eyes glow with supreme determination. All of her abilities cost 1 extra, but roll with a +2 and have a more magical edge to them. 50% - Vadyra seems to be getting weaker bit by bit, but she still has fight in her. Spikes stretch across her body almost against her will, and Once per Round, she may fire off a spike from her body for 2 damage to a target within 4 range. 25% - Vadyra may have been beaten down, but God help you if you don’t think she can’t get back up. Her basic attack damage is increased by 1, and all of her costs are decreased by 1. Additionally, Vadyra can tell the emotions of someone with a look...And can definitely tell if someone’s into her."
ability,Vadyra,Rising Fury!,2,,"Vadyra winds up her serpentlike tail and springs up in the air, bringing someone along with her before violently slamming them back down into the hard, hard earth, dealing 7 damage to the target and dealing additional depending on the land (or person) that they dropped on. White - Vadyra INSTEAD tosses the target upwards with a chain attached to them, before she violently pulls it slamming a target of her choice down for 5 damage anywhere within 4 spaces of her. Yellow - ...Or, well, she simply drops them in this mode, only dealing 4 damage...Followed by a large fireball that she throws down with them, dealing another 4 and leaving a crater of fire in the impact zone, as she lands in the area of fire, not taking damage from it as it is her creation. Orange - As they hit the floor, a variety of spikes stick into them, dealing 2 damage per round until they’re all removed. If enough time passes, they fall out naturally. Red - With an uppercut cloaked in fire, she brutally grabs the target and sends them spiralling down into the floor with her, dealing 13 damage (but with no terrain bonus damage) as a smoldering crater is left in its wake. Any anytimes the target uses to counter this have a -13. This ability is a 4 cost in Red mode."
ability,Vadyra,Drive,,,"Two fiery wings seem to form at Vadyra’s back as she charges violently in a 5 tile straight line, dealing 6 damage to the first person (or object) hit, and 4 to following ones while also dragging them to the end of the line with her. White - Vadyra also casually throws the primary target that got rammed up to 3 spaces away, dealing 2 extra damage to them if they were a person, and dealing variable damage if it was a thrown object instead. Yellow - As she runs along the line, the earth parts and fire is created wherever she goes. Anyone who steps through it takes 2 damage, except for her, who is undamaged. Orange - Vadyra, when she picks up one target, drags them along the ground instead as dozens of sharp spikes pop up and impale the target as she runs them along.. This deals 9 damage and halves their next movement action. Other people she runs into after the first do not take damage or get moved. Red - After that’s over, Vadyra follows up with the same thing again dealing reduced damage. She can go in a different direction, or the same direction. This use of it does not proc the Red passive, nor does it cost anything."
ability,Vadyra,The Wild Card,5⛯,,"This ability changes completely depending on Vadyra’s stance. Once per Combat. White Mercy - Curious to see what her allies are capable of and how her enemies fight back, Vadyra focuses a notably forceful punch, massive thorns dulling the blow a bit. Vadyra sends the target of the attack up to 5 spaces in a direction that makes sense according to where she punched, dealing 5 damage and letting an ally of her choice follow up. Yellow Incineration - With a sultry laugh, evidently entertained by your pathetic efforts of defeating her, Vadyra charges an incredibly powerful bolt of burning energy that turns white hot, before she fires it like a laser beam in a 1x8 line of her choice, dealing 8 damage (-2 for each person hit) leaving a burn debuff that makes the targets deal half damage to her for 1 round. After this attack, her fists glow with burning energy, making her next basic attack (within 3 rounds) deal 2 extra damage. Orange Altar - An altar of spikes is created, impaling a target adjacent to her before the nails of her hand become claws and she reaches into the target, taking a portion of their power and CRUSHING it in her hand, removing one ability for a round of her choice from the target and giving her a bonus relating to the ability. This ability cannot be a once per combat, or out/overclass...It also deals a total of 9 damage. Seeing Red - Determined to finish this here and now, Vadyra grabs a hold of an adjacent target and throws them, focusing the fires of Crimson Hell itself down on the target dealing 10 damage and leaving a 5x5 crater around her that deals a fair amount of damage to anyone caught as well...Before she continues beating their face in no matter how weak she looks, for another hit of 5 damage. In the aftermath, the crater area becomes dangerous as particles of the area are still white hot, falling to the ground almost snow-like, dealing 3 damage to anyone that ends their turn within. Fight Crazy - Wild Card’s variations each get a buff and each variation becomes once per combat individually instead of once per combat for the entire ability. White Mercy - Curious to see what her allies are capable of and how her enemies fight back, Vadyra focuses a notably forceful punch, massive thorns dulling the blow a bit. Vadyra sends the target of the attack up to 5 spaces in any direction, dealing 7 damage and letting an ally of her choice follow up with a movement and action. Yellow Incineration - With a sultry laugh, evidently entertained by your pathetic efforts of defeating her, Vadyra charges an incredibly powerful bolt of burning energy that turns white hot, before she fires it like a laser beam in a 3x10 line of her choice, dealing 8 damage leaving a burn debuff that makes the targets deal half damage to her for 1 round. After this attack, her fists glow with burning energy, making each physical attack she does for the next 1d3 rounds apply a stack of burn(which deals 1d4 fire damage). Orange Altar - An altar of spikes is created, impaling a target adjacent to her before the nails of her hand become claws and she reaches into the target, taking a portion of their power and CRUSHING it in her hand, removing one ability of her choice from the target for the rest of combat and giving her a bonus relating to the ability as well as the power use the ability herself once per three rounds. This ability cannot be an out/overclass. This attack also deals a total of 10 damage. Seeing Red - Determined to finish this here and now, Vadyra grabs a hold of an adjacent target and throws them, focusing the fires of Crimson Hell itself down on the target dealing 15-20 damage and leaving a 5x5 crater around her that deals half of that to any enemies within...Before she continues beating their face in, burying them in the ground and dealing an additional 1d4!(which explodes on 3-4) damage. In the aftermath, the crater area becomes dangerous as particles of the area are still white hot, falling to the ground almost snow-like, dealing 3 damage to anyone that ends their turn within."
ability,Vadyra,Tough Love,2!,,"Vadyra dashes to a target of her choice up to 4 spaces away and pierces them, trying to tear them apart with her claws, before throwing them disdainfully onto the ground or up to 3 spaces away for 4 damage. Refreshes at the top of the round or on her turn, whichever is closer. White - This ability has infinite range, as Vadyra just teleports to the target. Yellow - A sigil appears upon the prey’s back, which she may activate at any time for a -3 to the targets next roll and another 1d4 damage. Orange - As she slams them onto the ground, needles manifest and pierce into the target's body, leaving them somewhat pinned to the ground. She may roll again to chase(if they moved) and slam them into the dirt again, doing 2 more damage up to three times. Red - In a fury, Vadyra seems like she may just tear someone in half creating a terrifying scream of pain that only invigorates her further. Vadyra gets a +4 to targeting the same person she did with this attack once and she may use this ability twice between recharges."
weapon,Xharia,Reversal of Power,,,"Xharia fights primarily using Aikido, meaning she focuses on using her opponent’s power against them. When using this basic attack, Xharia simply takes a stance, looking at her opponents. The next time an opponent attempts to attack her, she will try to retaliate, turning their attack on themselves. Deals the same damage as the target’s attack, though if Xharia doesn’t roll higher than them she will still take the damage from their attack. This will also work against ranged attacks, though she will always take the damage from those attacks. She can also use this as a general attack, performing some kind of CQC maneuver, usually resulting in some combination of 0-5 damage and extra effects. (27 Prof) In Body and Mind - Xharia’s oneness with her epithet allows her to use it relatively minorly in just about any physical activity she does. On top of just being generally helpful, this also allows her basic attack to count as using her epithet, for the sake of applying benefits as such. (Prof gain on crit, Epithet Engine effects, Regalia Class boost, etc.) (36 Prof) Ever Vigilant - So long as at least one of Xharia’s hands is available and free, she may use the held action version of her basic attack as a reaction once per round. (38 Prof) Style of the Open Palm - The damage range of Xharia’s basic attack is increased to 1-7, and she may also choose to apply knockback instead of a basic CQC move."
talent,Xharia,Hybridization,,,"Sometimes there’s only so much you can do with a single epithet. However, with the natural authority granted by Xharia’s epithet, she can do a little more than what would normally be expected. Whenever Xharia creates a new regalia, she may pull from her Regalia Catalogue or simply roll 3 random words, and make a sort of “hybrid” epithet, with properties pulled from both. The regalia’s appearance may take the form of either epithet, or some combination of both, and any effect produced can have effects and properties based off of one or both of the words. Hybrid regalia cannot be stored with Regalia Catalogue."
talent,Xharia,Speedy Transformation,,,"Xharia may now use her regalia as a swift action when first creating them, and she has one, low power bonus action usage of any of her available regalia on her turn. This upgrade applies to any instance of Xharia creating new regalia, whether it be transforming to something from her catalogue, or using one of her abilities."
passive,Xharia,Regalia Class,,,"As the quintessential Regalia-class epithet, Xharia’s coat resonates when around other epithets that are primarily Regalia-class. This resonation gives them both various bonuses, letting them use their epithet-based abilities and effects with a +2 to rolls and allowing them to get a little more power out of them. Furthermore, as an action Xharia may temporarily transform the coat to look exactly like the other person’s regalia, allowing her to perform some effect based on their epithet, or perhaps use one of their abilities, but at a slightly lesser effect. Living Regalia - Instead of transforming her coat or otherwise creating a regalia like normal, Xharia may choose to separate it from the coat and give it limited sentience. This new summon-like regalia has its own movement equal to Xharia’s as well as its own action, and acts on her turn. Any damage dealt to the regalia is transferred directly to her, however, and it cannot act if Xharia is knocked out. If the summon is using an epithet from the Regalia Catalogue, then that epithet/word is locked out until the summon is brought back as a free action."
passive,Xharia,Epithet Engine,,,"Given its natural affinities and effects, Xharia’s coat is very effective at taking in and manipulating power. Whenever Xharia is hit by an epithet-based effect, she can choose to take some of it into her coat. Xharia may now apply effects based on that epithet or general ability that hit her to her own uses of her coat, alongside whatever other things it might have based on its current form."
passive,Xharia,Spear of the Stars,,,"When it’s in its base state, Xharia’s epithet now also has a spear of similar design to her coat, glowing with a golden energy. Whenever Xharia performs an action, she may choose to apply effects derived from the words “Venus” or “Pierce” to it, enhancing it in some way. Furthermore, she may use her spear as a part of her basic attack, reducing the maximum damage by 2 but increasing its range by 2, along with the damage being treated as “true damage” (pierces all forms of defence)."
ability,Xharia,Form of the Soul,3,,"Xharia focuses on the core of a target’s being, and her coat produces a version of their epithet/core word/base concept that functions as a regalia-class epithet. For most epithets this changes how they work at least a little bit through the new regalia, though it will generally be less powerful than the person’s epithet itself, allowing for one or two effects based on it. Xharia may keep this for herself or hand it to an ally, though it will disappear after combat. Furthermore, the regalia created from this ability cannot benefit from Xharia’s passive, as it is a part of her regalia. (33 Prof) Lasting Power - Once per session, Xharia may choose one Regalia created from Form of the Soul to remain for the rest of the session. This Regalia becomes temporarily de-linked from Xharia’s epithet, allowing them both to benefit from her passive."
ability,Xharia,Reformation Regalia,X,,"Xharia extends her arm to the side, as her coat morphs and changes to fit her new desire. Roll 3 random words. Xharia’s regalia then morphs to fit what one of those words might be as a regalia-class epithet, and she can use it as if it were her epithet until she morphs it back into her coat as a free action. Cost is dependent on the effect and word produced. The created regalia may be immediately used as a bonus action, as well. Xharia always makes sure to remember some of her favorite forms that her Regalia has taken throughout her experiences. By spending an additional 3 stamina after using Reformation Regalia and before transforming it back to her normal coat, she may store that transformation for later, allowing her to recreate it when she uses the ability in the future. Currently only one form may be stored in this way, however. Attempting to store a new form will erase the previous one. (43 Prof) Slot Expansion - Regalia Catalogue now has an additional slot. (53 Prof) Hybrid Storage - Hybrid epithets can now be stored in the Regalia Catalogue, however they take up as many slots as there are words in the hybrid, and they cannot be used separately. The hybrid may be split as a free action, however if this is done then one of the words must be sacrificed."
ability,Xharia,Quick Thinking,1!,,"When your epithet is constantly changing shape and form and you're in the middle of combat, you need to be able to think on your feet and use what you have. Using this ability, Xharia may produce an anytime effect that would make use of her current regalia, or use one of the regalia she's made from ""Form of the Soul"". Once per round per regalia."
ability,Xharia,Fabric Weaver,1,,"Given that it is her epithet, Xharia has almost complete control over her coat, including its shape, size, and other properties. Using this, she can do just about anything you could imagine, from hardening it into solid armor for DR, to using it as a tether to attach to someone, to creating sharp blades to cut through enemies, or anything else you can think of. This can be done no matter what form her coat is in, but as the coat is the base and most natural form of it, this ability has advantage when it isn’t transformed. (40 Prof) Quick Weaving - Fabric Weaver may now also be used as a bonus action while her regalia is in its natural state."
ability,Xharia,Venusian Force,X,,"Xharia stabs her spear into a target within 3 spaces, dealing 3 damage and leaving an imprint of the spear in their body. The wound doesn’t seem to bleed, however the target begins to feel their body adjust in other ways. For the next X rounds (X being the stamina spent on this ability), the target is impacted by some effect related to “Venus” of Xharia’s choosing."
weapon,Null,Boreas Rifle,,,"Null’s personal sniper rifle, specially designed to be usable at extreme ranges, both relatively close and up to a few kilometers away, though the extreme ranges require Null to have set up her epithet to not have significant roll debuffs. 7 damage at between 4 and 6 range. The maximum range may be increased to 10 by using this as a full-round action. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - The minimum range no longer applies to the rifle."
weapon,Null,Shurikens,,,"For when Null is forced to fight at extremely close range, though not nearly as deadly as her rifle. 3 damage at 0-3 range."
talent,Null,Sick Hover Tricky,,,"Null owns a hoverboard that she regularly rides around on either for fun, transportation, or to get a good vantage point for sniping. While it doesn’t give her a fly speed during combat, it does let her ignore most ground hazards or sudden pits."
passive,Null,Matrix Calculations,,,"At the beginning of combat, Null may assign a 6x6xInfinite area anywhere on the battlefield as her “Matrix”. This cannot be changed by effects in any way, as it isn’t a physical field but rather a mental designation superimposed over the real world by Null’s epithet. Null has perfect cognition of everything within her Matrix, giving her near-instant reaction time to anything happening within and giving her certain benefits. Anyone within her Matrix is considered to be within range of her basic attack, regardless of her actual distance from the area (Doesn't extend minimum range), whenever someone tries to move within the matrix once per round Null may choose to make an immediate basic attack against them, and Null gets a dodge roll against any traditionally dodgeable effects happening within or traveling through her matrix. Finally, Null has a natural +3 to targeting anyone within her Matrix. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - The reaction shot part of the passive is now once per turn, and her roll bonus is increased to a +5."
passive,Null,Reflection Panels,,,"When Null fires shots from her rifle, she can create “Reflection Panels” within her matrix that cause the shot to ricochet at a trajectory of her choosing, paying 1 stamina per panel up to a maximum of 3 panels. A panel breaks once a bullet has bounced off of it. This is done essentially as a once per round anytime, meaning that she can also set them up for allies, though she won’t be able to do so for herself on her turn in that case. Additionally, for every panel the shot bounces off of, the range of the shot is increased by 3, which doesn’t start being expended until the shot leaves her matrix. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - There is no limit to how many panels may be created, and the cost is reduced to 1 stamina every 2 panels."
ability,Null,Tactical Retreat,1!,,"Null throws a few grenades into the air and then follows up by immediately blowing them up with some of her shurikens. This deals 2 damage to a target right in front of her and any adjacent spaces, as a smokescreen covers the area giving Null the chance to immediately run away up to 4 spaces while her opponents are blinded. This, of course, interrupts actions as well. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - The movement from this ability is now doubled."
ability,Null,Reformatting,1,,"By temporarily tapping into her epithet’s power, Null adjusts her Matrix to better fit her desire, moving anything within her matrix around as she pleases on the x and y axis (this can’t send people or objects up into the air or underground, for example). This may be used as a free action on Null’s turn if she spends 2 more stamina. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - This is now a once per round anytime action, and always a free action on her turn."
ability,Null,Piercing Round,3,,"After careful aim and some calculation help from her epithet, Null fires a shot from her rifle that pierces targets up to its maximum range (or the end of her matrix, if the target is in the middle of it), halving in damage for each target (rounded up) to a minimum of 3 damage. Just like her basic attack, this may be used as a full-round action to increase the maximum range to 10. If piercing targets within her matrix, the damage only decreases by 1-2 damage per target, alternating (decreases by 1, then by 2, then by 1 again, etc.). Enter the Matrix Upgrade - The damage only decreases by 1 per target hit, and ends when it hits a solid object or has dealt the minimum damage twice."
ability,Null,Static Disruption,1,,"Null creates a strange, static-y effect within her Matrix, dealing 3 damage to any enemies within and allowing Null to move her Matrix to a new location. The static effect remains for a round, dealing an additional 2 damage to enemies that stay in the area at the end of their turn. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - The static also deals 1 damage per space moved to every enemy while it’s up, instead of moving the matrix position."
ability,Null,Fusion Through Addition,3,,"Null selects two 2x2 areas on the field, and performs “addition” with them. This essentially temporarily “fuses” the things in the equivalent spaces of each matrix. What this actually means is that whatever is in the first area temporarily gains properties from the equivalent thing in the other(for example, if a character and a generator are in equivalent spaces, the character might gain some electrical or metal properties such as DR or a thorns effect). If a space has nothing in it, it is treated as a “0”, and the equivalent space in the other area doesn’t have anything happen to it. Enter the Matrix Upgrade - Null may freely choose what gets fused, paying 1 stamina per two things instead of normal stamina cost."
weapon,Simon,A Clean Hit!,,,"Simon just washed his hands and is ready to get em dirty again! Punch time! 3 damage melee attack...He’s not that physically strong, okay?"
weapon,Simon,Bar of Soap,,,"Yep, you read the name right. 1 damage with 3 range."
talent,Simon,Soap Shoes,,,Simon has bars of soap attached to the bottoms of his shoes at all times! This gives him +2 movement and allows him to skate on the ground like Shadow the Hedgehog.
talent,Simon,Slippery Weasel,,,"Grapples, and other techniques that require grabbing onto Simon roll with disadvantage due, since it’s hard to get a grip on such a soapy boy. If Simon desires, he can let down his soapy layer to let these actions roll normally."
passive,Simon,Scrubba-Dub-Dub!,,,"Whenever Simon successfully performs an action, he ends up washing up a storm! Due to his soapy body, bubbles come flying off him and act as an object on the field. Someone who touches the group of bubbles heal for half of the damage Simon dealt with the action that produced them, and if the action did not deal damage, they instead heal for 1 stamina. Anything the bubbles touch is also cleaned up very nicely!"
ability,Simon,Scented to Perfection,2,,"Simon lathers his or an ally’s hands in a scented soap of his choice. Depending on the type of scent (ex. Lavender, Rosemary, Cheese, etc.), the buff gained from this is determined, but it typically gives some sort of attack boost alongside whatever other effect it grants."
ability,Simon,Bubble Bop,1!,,"Two giant plumes of bubbles envelop objects of Simon’s choice, and when they clear, the objects have swapped places! Wow! If he wants, Simon can simply teleport one from one place to another using this ability. Once per round."
ability,Simon,Foam Sculpture,3,,"Simon causes a swarm of bubbles to form into a shape of his choice, and then solidifies it into a soap statue. Dependent on the object Simon decides to create, the actual application of this statue changes, but it can always act as cover if nothing else. However, as it takes damage, it whittles down into shapes also of Simon’s choosing. So, for example, if a statue of a dragon takes a lot of wear and tear, it can be worn down into a small weapon that Simon and co. can use."
weapon,Sohi,Dual Chakrams,,,"Not any more special than normal chakrams, but to Sohi they might as well be massive. Can be used 2 times in a single action, however only the first attack applies status, if relevant. 2 Damage 2 Range."
talent,Sohi,Advanced Psychokinesis,,,"Sohi isn’t really capable of speaking the common language, or really… any language that’s not shadowrealm native. They can, however, impression their general intentions onto people through mental communication, and they also have a general connection to emotions, able to easily psychically link with someone’s emotional state. By choosing this talent, Sohi can flex their psychic powers a little further than normal, allowing them to levitate small objects, leave general psychic imprints of himself in people’s minds, or more importantly, receive small buffs during combat based on the current emotional state of everyone around them."
talent,Sohi,Tiny Acrobat,,,"Given their natural small form and light body, Sohi is pretty good at just general acrobatic feats. They can easily run across or climb up walls up to their movement, are an adept jumper, and are just generally very nimble."
passive,Sohi,Book of Magick,,,"Sohi has on them a small notebook detailing the complex mechanics behind using a particular strand of elemental magic. While they don’t need the book itself to cast any of it, it helps to have for recording existing and new spells. At character creation he may only choose two abilities, however in return he can cast spells he’s learned from the book by combining elements together! Currently Sohi has 3 slots for putting elements together, which are detailed in the Book of Magick. He can only load up a maximum of 3(+2) elements per turn as well. There are a few ways to cast magic: Enchant Weapon (1) - Bonus Action. Enchant your weapon with the elements currently queued up. Two slots of one element add +1 damage of that type, and at least 1 slot holding an element adds the associated status to the attack. Enchantment lasts for 2 rounds. Enchant Self (1) - Bonus Action. Cover yourself with the elements currently queued up. Generally applies specific effects for each element, detailed in the Book of Magick. Except for specific circumstances, elements cannot be mixed on any one cast. Enchantment lasts for 2 rounds. Cast Spell - With a specific combination of elements together, cast a unique spell listed in the Book of Magick. Any relevant details including cost and action economy are listed with the spell. If used to cast a general spell, the cost is 1 unless otherwise specified in some way.Specific interactions and rules are detailed in the Book itself, however in general any individual spell cannot be cast 2 rounds in a row. (19 Prof) +2 to loading max per turn."
ability,Sohi,Whirling Assault,1,,"Sohi takes out both of their blades, spinning around rapidly as they leap forward. Deals basic attack damage to all enemies along and adjacent to his 5 space path."
ability,Sohi,Shadow Walk,1!,,"Taking a page from the shadowrealm book, Sohi briefly becomes a shadow as they dash up to half their movement away, dodging any attacks in the process. If Sohi is within a shadow that is not his own, he may instead transport to another shadow that he can see. The secondary effect may be activated without a roll as a movement action on Sohi’s turn."
ability,Sohi,Hungering Maw,3,,"Sohi may look cute and wear a mask, but underneath he is still a shadowrealm demon… and he hungers. Sohi may jump up to half his movement and bite down on something or someone, attempting to consume them. This may simply temporarily remove items from play, or restrict and damage a target as Sohi slowly begins consuming them more and more. So long as not too much time has passed, Sohi can still spit up items he’s eaten as a free action, though they may be a little more… broken. "
weapon,Avya,Wooden Quarterstaff,,,"This is nothing too special, just a lightweight but functional staff Avya lovingly carved from a long tree branch for self-defense. 4 Damage 2 Range."
talent,Avya,Sweet Touch,,,"Despite already being Silvanian, Avya’s epithet leaves her body coated in a very thin layer of sap at all times. Not only does this make her skin smooth and nice to the touch, but it also tastes really sweet, and gives off a pleasant aroma that makes it much easier for her to calm down and soothe those who are otherwise angry, excitable, or generally hyperactive."
ability,Avya,Wild Touch,X,,"Not only is life able to flourish within her aura, but Avya has general control over most plant life that exists within it as well. By using this ability, Avya can create and/or manipulate some kind of plant in the area, producing a wide variety of effects. Cost is determined by the desired effect."
ability,Avya,Embrace of Nature,1!,,"In order to protect herself or an ally, Avya focuses, forcing some kind of effect to happen with the nature around her. This can come in the form of blocking an attack, pulling an ally or herself out of the way, holding back a foe, etc. This ability has advantage if it’s effect is within her aura."
ability,Avya,Spread the Influence,2,,"Avya plants a seed down in an adjacent space, and after a moment a small root pops out of the ground, connected to her own epithet. This root has 10 stamina and has its own instance of Avya’s aura. Only two roots can be active at a time, and the effects don’t stack with Avya’s aura or each other. However, unlike her own instance of the aura, Avya can benefit from the effect of these."
weapon,Lars,Sheer Cold,,,"Lars’s hands imbue themselves with potent ice energy as his ferocious fighting prowess shatters the opposition. On rolls of 15+, a hit unit’s movement is decreased by 1-2. 5 Damage 1 Range."

passive,Lars,Winter's Fangs Bury Themselves Ever Deeper,,,"Lars, via his Epithet, can force his body temperature to rapidly decline, reaching depths that no other could without killing themselves. For Lars, this state of deep-freezing is empowering, and while it has its costs, he is able to utilize this power to achieve grand new heights. At the start of Lars’s turns, he is able to designate a part of his body to undergo severe freezing. These parts include: each of his arms, each of his legs, his torso, and his head. Freezing a particular body part comes with its own augmentations to Lars’s kit. Arms - If Lars freezes either of his arms, he gains +1 damage on all attacks, as well as the ability to afflict hit units with the Frostnip Status on rolls of 14 or higher. When a unit is afflicted with Frostnip, Lars specifies a part of their body, which becomes partially frozen over. Any actions involving that body part are rolled with disadvantage, and the unit takes 1d2 damage at the start of their turns while afflicted.  If both of Lars’s arms are frozen, he instead gains +3 damage on everything, and Frostnip’s roll DC is decreased to 12. However, going all out like this causes him to take recoil damage whenever he deals damage. Legs - If Lars freezes either of his legs, he becomes resistant to knockback based effects, and every space he steps on becomes coated in pointed ice, dealing 3-4 damage to anyone that steps on it.  If both of Lar’s legs are frozen, his movement is cut in half (rounding down), but he is able to power through anytimes attempting to interrupt his actions. Torso - If Lars freezes his torso, he gains 1 DR, and when he is attacked, his body releases a cloud of icy mist that deals 1-3 damage to all adjacent units and causes the next stamina cost they take to be increased by 1. However, his movement is reduced by 1, and he has a -2 to all actions as it is more difficult to dynamically move. Head - If Lars freezes his head, he gains a +2 on all actions as his mind focuses, positive statuses are slightly boosted, and negative statuses are slightly nerfed. However, due to his sense of pain being numbed, his body doesn’t react to damage as normal, causing him to take 1-2 extra whenever he takes damage."
ability,Lars,Hunter Assault,3,,"Lars cracks a massive grin before an Epithetical arctic wolf head surrounds him. With a howl, he bursts forward X spaces in a straight line, with X being equal to his movement +1. He grasps his hands onto the first unit he passes through, causing the wolf to bite its icicle fangs into them, and then drags them along with him while continuing to pummel them. This deals 7 + (the number spaces they have been dragged) damage. It also leaves the wolf’s fangs in hit units, causing the next stamina cost they take to be increased by 1. This ability has a one round cooldown."
ability,Lars,The Emperor's Frozen Garb,2+X,,"Flexing every muscle possible, Lars produces a massive, floating version of a body part currently frozen via his Passive. He then commands this body part to perform a devastating attack upon a unit within 4 spaces of him. This typically deals 7-11 damage to hit units, has the potential for great knockback, and upon using this, Lars’s used body part becomes unfrozen. If Lars desires, he can expend multiple body parts at once, causing them all to attack simultaneously. However, doing so increases the cost of this ability by 2 for each part."
ability,Lars,Withering Fang,1,,"Smashing his arm into the ground, Lars produces a fang constructed of ice that pierces through the ground and into a unit within two spaces of him. This deals 5-6 damage to a hit unit, reduces their movement by 1 for the next round, and makes it so they are unable to use their basic attack on their next turn unless they’re willing to also take half of the damage they deal (rounded down)."
weapon,LORD,World’s Strongest Fist,,,An all out punch by The World’s Strongest. 1 damage at 1 range.
talent,LORD,Superior Luck,,,"Things tend to go well for Lord, he gets a natural +2 to all his rolls. (but can still critically fail). 9 Talent Upgrade: Superiorest Luck - Once per combat Lord’s +2 may count as a natural modifier that can negate a crit fail."
passive,LORD,The Lord's Engine,,,"When faced with danger Lord’s heartbeat starts to beat louder till it sounds like an engine ready to let loose. This creates an aura of intimidation 5ft around him. The more danger Lord is faced with or the more terrifying/impressive actions that get accredited to him makes him rev the engine faster and increasing his aura. If anyone is in the aura they less likely to target him with anything due to either fear or the reassurance that he’s got it covered and enemies suffer a minus to their rolls when targeting him. Of course this isn’t actually an intimidation technique, Lord is scared out of his damn mind."
ability,LORD,Wow! Lord Is AMAZING!!,2!,,"Whenever an amazingly cool or devastating action happens (or just succeeds), a random bystander (whether it’s possible or not for them to be there) calls attention to it and immediately thinks that Lord did it. This gives him a stored copy of the roll used for the action to distribute and a possible increase to his Lord Engine as he feels the guilt. Once Per Round."
ability,LORD,Unseen Assistance,2,,"Lord is very strong, sometimes things get taken care of without others even noticing (sometimes even him). While everyone is distracted by Lord’s turn an unknown ally to Lord comes in and deals 5 damage to a target and gets out without anyone even noticing. Everyone thinks Lord did it. Even on a Nat 20 check."
ability,LORD,Negative Armageddon Blaster DEATH EX,3⛯,,"Lord shouts the name of one of his ultimate techniques. Everyone in the range of his Lord’s Engine and in a straight 3xInfinite line in front of him must move away from him before it fires. Every enemy in his aura and everyone in the 3xInfinite line takes 1 damage. Once Per Combat. SECRET ACHIEVEMENT: If Negative Armageddon Blaster DEATH EX knocks out a target whose max stamina is more than 10, LORD unlocks the true power that he’s had locked inside of himself this entire time. Negative Armageddon Blaster DEATH EX now applies to all enemies on the field, regardless of if they’re in the aura or the beam. Those inside the normal applications of the attack take double damage now."
ability,LORD,"I’ll Do My Best, Which Isn’t Much",1,,Lord is incredibly humble! He often derides his own True Capacity with negative comments on his skill. As a bonus action on his turn he may make one such comment before either an outsider or any ally may comment on how incredibly much he’s down-talking his amazing capacity. This heals him for 1d3 emotional support health.
weapon,Pearl,Atlas Anchor,,,"A huge anchor that she took off her own flagship, because “we should always be moving forward!” Despite never telling her crew, she regrets this decision immensely, but has grown too attached to the anchor to just reattach it to the chain, and is too lazy to put another one on. Plus this one has a buncha’ coolio mods! 6 Damage 1 Range."
talent,Pearl,"""Dodgeball""",,,"Pearl has had excess amounts of practice hitting cannon balls back opposing ships. She doesn’t feel bad, and neither should you, because they were firing cannons at a 15 year old. Whenever attacked with a projectile, she can roll to deflect some damage. If it’s a large one, then she can roll to just knock it back. (She’s still practicing deflecting melee attacks!)"
passive,Pearl,Riches to More Riches,,,"Pearl’s red stat is her Riches stat, though that’s not saying much considering that she’s really freakin’, so point is, this is her “In the moment wealth” stat. Sometimes when attacking someone, money will come flying out of them ala coin battle in Super Smash Brothers, which Pearl can then collect to add to her “Riches.” She can sacrifice 3 points for adding 1 to a roll, throwing another black pearl in BPB, or store them to get bonuses at various milestones. Riches can also be stolen from her for adding +1 to your rolls if needed. 5: Pearl gets an extra movement, as money begets more money! 10: Pearl’s 3 cost abilities cost 1 less for as long as she has 10 Riches, cuz hey, healthcare ain’t cheap. 16: Pearl can use 1 Riches to negate 1 damage until her red stat goes to 15. 20: The extra money is really starting to weigh down her pockets, and her anchor! One extra damage is added to her basic attack. 25: Pearl gains 4 temporary stamina because of how all of this money is cushioning the blow. It pays to be rich! 30: Everyone else on the team gets these buffs! Hooray for teamwork! The Riches stat goes away at the end of combat."
ability,Pearl,Black Pearl Barrage,3,,"Pearl takes out some of her “Black Pearls” and baseballs them with her anchor up to 6 spaces away. These “Black Pearls” are bombs. She chooses when each one will explode, now, a round from now, two rounds form now etc. (She can also make them never go off, which is a fun prank to pull around the flagship.) When they do explode, a 3x3 radius is affected for 3 damage. Usually, 2-3 pearls are shot out upon use."
ability,Pearl,I can do that too! ,1!,,"Pearl is still pretty impressionable all and all, so she does something that she’s seen, at some point, during the combat. This can be anything from using an ability, to hitting something a certain way, to falling over. Hey, as long as it works!"
ability,Pearl,Flagship Frickery,3⛯,,"Pearl calls the flagship by shooting a flare into the air, and somehow, no matter where she is or what she’s doing, it will respond in three ways: One - Three 3x3 cannonballs crash in a line wherever she wants, dealing 4 damage to anyone in the way. Two - From a random location, two pirates show up to assist Pearl. Hiding in the floorboards, rappelling in, just walking by after buying some milk, anything goes.  They both have 4 movement, 7 health, and a 3 damage 4 range flintlock pistol Three - A treasure chest falls near her, which has something that she wanted, most often an important artifact of her journeys across the seas. Four - This isn’t something it does, this is just me saying it’s a once per combat. (Important Note - Despite heading the fleet, she is still not allowed to curse.) "
weapon,Sillica,Brick-Filled Teddy Bear,,,Why does she have a teddy bear… and WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE IT’S FILLED WITH BRICKS!? 5 Damage 1 Range
talent,Sillica,"You wouldn’t hit a child, would you?",,,"Despite her actual age, Silica still looks like a 7 year old child, and that tends to trigger something in people’s minds. With a little help from her envy powers, so long as someone doesn’t directly hate/despise children, anyone targeting Silica with an attack must roll with disadvantage. Other children are immune to this."
passive,Sillica,Chaos Gremlin,,,"Silica has an unusual fondness for DBA for a demon, and her personality and power make it hard for her to take most combats seriously. She’d rather turn it into a game of some kind, or just spread general chaos for her amusement. Fittingly, as Silica changes the combat to fit closer to her image of what it should be (read: a chaotic bullshit DBA episode), it’s easier for her to succeed at things. For every successful use of “I Reject Your Reality” or ""Chaos, Chaos!"", Silica gets a +1 to all of her rolls so long as the change she made isn’t reverted or gotten rid of somehow (and it adds to the chaos). This caps at a +3."
passive,Sillica,Extreme Imp Connection,,,"Silica has used Imps so much that she has created an innate connection between herself and them. This passive allows Silica to perceive the world through any summoned imp's senses, and Silica can always use her abilities as if she were where the imp is, or targeting the imp itself. She may also spend a movement action to swap with an imp without rolling at the cost of 1 stamina"
ability,Sillica,I Reject Your Reality,X,,"Change something in the universe! Anything goes, so long as it doesn’t directly affect a character’s sheet or significantly alter the rules of combat. Cost is based on the change made. If the cost is 1 or less, this ability counts as a free action instead of a regular action."
ability,Sillica,"Chaos, Chaos! ",2!,,Silica snaps her fingers and causes the world around her to alter in unpredictable ways. Cause everyone within a 2x2 area to be affected by wild magic! Once per round.
ability,Sillica,Imp Swarm!,1,,"Being a still relatively young demon, and the youngest of the sisters of sin, Silica has a unique connection to imps. As such, she can summon a few to help her in combat. Summon 2 imps next to Silica that each have a 3 damage 1 range basic attack. Imps are destroyed in one solid hit, being banished back into hell, as they don’t have enough power to keep themselves on the mortal plane for long. So long as they are within 6 spaces of Silica, she can also move a summoned imp in front of her as a once per round anytime action to avoid taking damage."
weapon,Wagner,GO!!!,,,"Wagner wants to beat you up now, and nothing’s gonna stop him. Wagner charges forward with a shoulder bash acting as a 5 damage 2 range attack that knocks hit targets at least 1 space backwards"
weapon,Wagner,The Bourgeoizooka,,,"Wagner has had a lot of time to prepare for his treasure hunting, and as such, has fashioned some of his scales into a hyper durable rocket launcher. Some would say that it's a surprise tool that will help us later. Has 5 range and deals 7 damage as it fires a chunk of gold at an enemy. However, this attack has a 3 round cooldown."
talent,Wagner,Technomancer,,,Wagner is surprisingly proficient with working on all things machines!... And by that it's more so that he's a master at making sure something shitty works just well enough to not explode. Advantage on rolls involving fixing technology and other mechanic type actions.
passive,Wagner,Coin Battle Bounty Hunting,,,"No matter what, Wagner’s always got his eyes on the prize: the prize being that sweet pile of moola. At the start of combat, he, and everyone else in combat, start with 12 coin stacks as an additional red stat, unless something in lore would determine that a character would have significantly more or less money on them. Everytime someone is hit, they lose half that damage amount in coin stacks as the money flings out in a random (1d8 to determine with clockwise order) direction. Of course, Wagner’s senses go into overdrive whenever he sees loose change, so standing adjacent to dropped coins causes him to get a +X on rolls, X being the amount of coin stacks. If he or an ally lose all of their coins, they go into a frenzy state where their movement and damage is doubled. If an enemy loses all of their coins, they are disheartened, making them take double damage and reducing healing by half. Coins can be picked back up by anyone by walking over them. 18: C A P I T A L I S M - Wagner’s better than everyone else, so he starts with 13 coins instead of 12."
ability,Wagner,Moneymaker,X,,"Wagner wants a new tool to play with, but, those cost MONEY. Well, why don’t we make it on our own...using the money as the tools to make it! With this, Wagner molds the gold from his money stacks into a weapon of his design. For each stamina paid to use this ability, a money stack is used on production, causing the weapon to be bigger and better. This weapon can be remodeled back into money stacks as an action if Wagner desires, but be careful, because if these weapons backfire they tend to explode and remove money used to make them from combat. (20) Master of Disaster - If one of Wagner’s weapons made from Moneymaker actually DOES backfire and explode, he can choose the direction he is launched from said explosion, and the launch distance is always a little longer than everyone else’s. (30) But Um, Look Guys, Look: It’s One of My GREATEST Achievement - As a once per session free action, Wagner can state that one of the weapons created via Moneymaker is “one of his greatest achievement”. Since he holds it in such high regard, he makes sure to hold onto bits and pieces of the gold that made it before. As such, each time he tries to craft that specific weapon, it costs half the Money Stacks to do so for the rest of the session."
ability,Wagner,MINE MINE MINE,1!,,"Wagner sees something he wants, and he wants it now. Suddenly a golden, ghostly hand appears before an object of his choice, grabs it, and boops back over to Wagner. NOW IT’S HIS!...WHATEVER THAT DOES FOR HIM SURE IS VARIABLE. Once per round. (23) YOU’RE NOT GETTING AWAY!! - When using MINE MINE MINE, Wagner can pay an additional 2 stamina to bring himself to the object instead of the object to him. This requires a bit more effort though, so if Wagner’s feeling lazy he may not do it simply on principle "
ability,Wagner,IF I CAN’T HAVE IT...,2,,"Wagner chooses a 3x3 area which suddenly erupts in dark flame, dealing 4-7 damage to everyone inside. Everyone hit by this has any buffs removed off of them. Wagner then rolls 1d2 after the initial hit, with a 1 causing the buffs to be destroyed and a 2 causing the buffs to be transferred onto him and him alone."
ability,Wagner,Treasure of the Golden Dragon,3,,"Having got a fair amount of plunder, Wagner’s scales glisten as he melts a chosen amount of money stacks on himself, giving him a golden coat. For every 2 stacks he spends, he gains +1 damage across the board, and for every 4, he gains +1 DR. He must pay an upkeep cost equivalent to half of the money stacks he used to activate this ability to maintain this form. Failing this ability only uses up to 3 money stacks, and uses of this ability can stack on top of itself."
weapon,Xia,Knitting Needles,,,"The needles that Xia's been using for her recent knitting endeavors! They're not that sharp, but they can make the difference when it counts!"
talent,Xia,Everyone’s Childhood Friend! :D,,,"For various personal reasons, Xia has moved around the world a lot during their life, and has had time to make a lot of different friends. As a result, they’re childhood friends with everyone in this particular friend group, and also with a lot of other people relatively close to their age. As a result, among other things they tend to know at least a few things about people who are her childhood friend, even if they haven't spoken with them in a while! Hard to say how they manage to keep track of all of these relationships though..."
talent,Xia,Intentions Speak Louder Than Words,,,"When interacting with someone who is nonverbal or otherwise cannot directly communicate with you, regardless of the reason you may make a roll with advantage to both communicate the general message of what you're attempting to say, as well as gauge the inverse of what the target is attempting to mean."
passive,Xia,Jack of all [BLANK]s,,,"After some personal exploration, Xia decided that the thing they want to be good at is, well, everything. They idolize the idea of a Renaissance person, and want to match up to that… but it’s gonna take a lot of work. Before the beginning of a session, Xia must decide on something to be their focus on learning to master. This can be literally anything from general martial arts to how to make a clown nose. For the duration of the session, the rest of Xia’s kit will have some amount of flavor and additional effects based on her current focus. Sometimes these are small flavor changes, and sometimes they can drastically change how something works. At the end of the session, Xia may choose to spend 20 max stamina to “master” their current focus, letting them use it as if it were her focus in the future, regardless of if it actually is at the time. The cost of mastering something goes down by 4 max for each session in which she chooses it as a focus, automatically mastering it when the cost is reduced to 0. Finally, she starts with 2 things already mastered."
ability,Xia,Speed Knitting (Expressiveness),1,,"With quick and dexterous fingers, Xia finishes up one of the many knitting projects she's got piled up! She can keep it for herself or toss it to a nearby ally, and wearing it imparts some kind of small buff, based on the type of clothing and Xia's goal with making it."
ability,Xia,Shifting the Initiative!,2,,"Xia grabs a nearby enemy (or object, or whatever) and tries to toss them around. This allows her to reposition the target somewhere next to them, leave the target prone, and deal minor damage. More importantly however, if this ability is successful then at the beginning of the next round Xia may choose to move themself either up or down one initiative position as they better prepare for the coming combat."
ability,Xia,"Everyone, Reposition!",1,,"Movement Action. Xia may sacrifice their movement to guide their allies, giving all of them a shared pool of movement equal to Xia’s current movement to use between them right now. Any movement that isn’t used goes back to Xia for the turn."
ability,Xia,Focus on Speed,1,,"Xia limbers themselves up as they get ready to dash ahead of the competition and get their moves in before anyone else. Their movement for the next round is increased by 2, and at the beginning of the next round they move 2 spaces forward in turn order, before any turns are resolved."
weapon,Villya,Celestial Missile,,,"A small but helpful attack, designed for those with bad aim. This attack is guaranteed to succeed and hit regardless of roll or attempts to dodge, however the damage may still be blocked. Damage increases are half as effective as normal on this attack as well. 12 Prof: Celestial Missile may count as a free action for rolls of 5 or less twice per round. 2 Damage 8 Range."
talent,Villya,Enhanced Senses,,,"Villya has, quite frankly, terrible eyesight, as a good amount of it is being redirected by her brain in order for her to be able to see into the future at all. As a result, the rest of her senses are much stronger, giving her advantage on most perception checks that don’t use eyesight, and other general uses from her four other senses."
passive,Villya,Future Visions,,,"Villya has an innate and intrinsic ability to sense and get a general idea of what will happen in the future. This gives her a few benefits, as well as plays into how she goes about fighting. At the beginning of each of her turns, Villya rolls 10d20. These rolls represent what her rolls for any actions or checks she makes will be for the duration of the round. These rolls must be used in order, and once her turn comes around again she loses any remaining rolls. If Villya is forced to make a roll when out of dice, she must roll at double disadvantage as she is unprepared for an event she didn’t foretell. This whole part of the passive is ignored when out of combat. At the beginning of a session, Villya rolls a d20, and on an 11+, she will receive some vague vision of something that will happen during the session. The specifics of how vague and how much information she receives is left up to the GM of the session. Once per session and in only one data bounty, Villya may offer to read a single ally’s fortune using her tarot cards. When she does so, the targeted ally must roll 3d21, re-rolling any repeats, to represent the three cards they receive. Villya may attempt to give her own interpretations of the cards, but even she doesn’t know what exactly whatever is pulled may entail. The universe seems to take notice, though…"
passive,Villya,Cast the Die,,,"At the beginning of a session, Villya may roll a d6, and keep track of the result. This is her “Fate Die”. She can evoke the Fate Die at any time to give herself a roll a bonus equal to the value of the die, however doing so changes the Fate Die’s value to 0 afterwards."
ability,Villya,A Look into Your Future,X,,"Choosing a target and briefly glimpsing into the future of their success and failure, Villya gets an idea of exactly what’s going to happen in their immediate future, losing sight of her own in the process. Villya may spend any number of her own Future Vision dice in order, allowing the target to pre-roll that many dice for themselves, restricted in their usage the same as Villya is. Cost is equal to 1+# of Future Vision dice spent."
ability,Villya,Celestial Conjuration,1,,"As a practicing mage, Villya’s not great with her magic just yet, though it’s made a little easier with where she pulls her magic from. With this ability, she can channel some of that power to conjure various things out of celestial energy to perform some task for her. Bonus Action."
ability,Villya,Predictive Precognition,X,,"Glimpsing into the future, Villya can attempt to read her visions to predict what’s going to happen in the future, and prepare for it. Using this ability, she may prepare up to 3 secret actions, paying one stamina for each and stocking one of her Future Vision dice as well. The stocked dice will be used in the order the events trigger, if they trigger at all. More general predictions will be lower strength as they have to account for a wide variety of possibilities within itself, while more specific predictions will tend to be more powerful due to the limited nature of options out of a specific prediction. If she wishes to cancel a secret action, she may do so as a free action at the cost of 1 stamina. (20 Prof) A Vision! - During combat, Villya always seems to get brief glimpses into the worst possible futures imaginable, whether she wants to or not. Luckily, she’s used to these enough that she can take advantage of them. When setting up secret actions, she may choose to leave the activation condition for one blank, allowing her to use it as a general reaction to try and keep that vision from becoming true."
ability,Villya,Celestial Shell,3!,,"In an effort to protect herself, Villya summons a shell of pure, hardened celestial energy. This takes up a 2x2 area, and it is impossible for anyone or anything to pass through, save for Villya herself and her possessions. She may maintain this shell on future turns at the cost of 1 stamina and her highest Future Vision roll (excluding 20’s). The shell itself has 20 stamina and 1 DR, and once destroyed cannot be re-summoned for the rest of combat. Once per Round."
weapon,Kai,Enchanted Estoc,,,An estoc that seems to radiate with a mysterious power. Deals holy/light-based damage at 1 range. 6 Damage 1 Range.
weapon,Kai,Angelico,,,"A relatively ornate parrying dagger that Jillette gave Kai for her 18th birthday. Can be used as a bonus action after an attack, or saved to use as a free once per round anytime parry. Because this dagger has been infused with holy energies, it can even parry ranged or non-physical attacks, and it does either physical or holy damage, whichever would be more effective. 3 Damage 1 Range."
weapon,Kai,Diabolos,,,"A legendary sword from Lucifer’s collection that he chose to gift to his daughter on her 18th birthday. The sword can produce hellfire to add demonic/fire based damage to an attack that ignores normal fire immunities or resistances, as well as allow it to cleave or increase in range at the cost of some damage. Kai is currently untrained in using it however, so any time she uses the sword she must pay 3 stamina. 8 Damage 1 Range."
talent,Kai,Demonologist,,,"Despite being only 19 years old, thanks to her partial demon heritage and some studying Kai knows at least something about any type of demon or fiend you can think of. Whether that info is useful or not is another matter."
talent,Kai,Demon Wings,,,"One of the things Kai inherited as a half demon is a demon’s wings, though they do require practice and effort to use. With this upgrade, she can use her wings to glide slightly or slow a fall, but otherwise they’re useless, for now... (50) Flight Training - With a bit of practice and some funky kinda-epithet usage, Kai now has essentially free-flight, though moving significantly above the ground during combat may incur a stamina cost. She also has +1 movement as a result."
talent,Kai,Demon Strength,,,"Another latent inheritance from her demon side, Kai has much greater physical strength, allowing her to easily lift and throw heavy objects, and giving her basic attack +1 damage."
talent,Kai,Cambion Soul,,,"Now accepting of her heritage and making use of the benefits it provides, Kai has various demonic bonuses naturally. She has free-flight (flying too high or remaining in the air for extended time may incur a stamina cost), +4 movement, Takes ¼ damage from fire and similar sources, can produce small fire sources without a roll, can control large fire sources to a decent extent (with a roll), and has extremely increased physical strength."
passive,Kai,Fire Affinity,,,"Being part demon, and with minimal training and practice, Kai has basic manipulation powers over fire. She can move and alter small sources of fire for free, or roll to mess with larger ones a little bit. Also, she takes half damage from fire attacks. (39) Fire Boost - Kai now has much better control over fire, incorporating her epithet’s power into moving it around, alongside her increasing strength as a demon. Kai now can very easily control decently-sized fires without having to roll, and can roll to influence very large fires. She also now takes ¼ damage from fire attacks. Furthermore, she can now create her own instances of fire, though this does require a roll."
passive,Kai,Spatial Flux,1,,"Kai enters into a state of uncertainty regarding her physical placement in the universe. While in Spacial Flux, Kai’s basic attack and abilities get +3 range, and anything targeting her gets a -2 to their roll. However, at the beginning of her turns while active, Kai must roll a 1d3, and on a 1 her passive activates. Upkeep 1 stamina per round. (14) Constant Flux - Spacial Flux is now a once per round anytime action. (37) Increased Fluctuation - Because of the increased power of her epithet, Kai is able to use it more to her benefit, but more power is simultaneously leaking from her mark as a result. Spacial Flux now gives Kai +4 range, a -4 to rolls targeting her, and a +3 to any rolls involving her epithet. (55) Automatic Flux - Spacial Flux no longer requires a roll to activate, and is treated as a bonus action on her turn instead of an anytime ability."
passive,Kai,Spatial Redux,1,,"Kai enters into a state of uncertainty regarding her physical placement in the universe. While in Spacial Redux, Kai gets a +2 to range and a +3 to any rolls involving her epithet. Furthermore, every round Kai gets a pool of ""spacial movement"" equal to her current movement stat. She may consider herself to be in any location within that amount of movement at any point, spending movement from the pool in the process. If being used to avoid an attack, she must make a roll and spend 1 spacial movement before moving, however it also gets the +3 bonus from this ability. This ability does not require a roll to activate, and is treated as a bonus action on her turn. Upkeep 1 stamina per round."
ability,Kai,Holy Lance,3,,"Kai temporarily makes the length and sharpness of her sword uncertain, and stabs at an opponent with it. Deals 7 damage at up to 2 range, and can pierce to hit one other opponent. (46) - Upgrade to “E X P A N D  S W O R D”. Kai applies her epithet to her sword, allowing it to pierce outwards at extreme speeds almost like a gun, creating a flash of white as it travels. Deals 9 damage to a target within 5 spaces, and pierces through into a maximum of two other valid targets as well. If only one enemy was hit by this ability, a fluctuating replica of Kai’s estoc is left in the target, dealing an additional two damage at the beginning of each of their turns until they can manage to remove the sword (with a decent roll). Demons, monsters, or other similar creatures cannot remove the sword on their own, take double damage from it being stuck in them, and other creatures removing it require a significantly higher roll than normal. The sword disappears upon being removed, but only one instance of it can exist per target affected."
ability,Kai,A Wrinkle in Space-Time,1!,,"By temporarily applying her epithet to the space around her, Kai shifts her position slightly, letting her immediately move 1 space as if she was there the whole time. Can be used to move through thin walls/doors or other barriers, or to avoid attacks. (25) Friendly Fixation - A Wrinkle in Space-Time may now be used on allies as well, or may apply to both Kai and anybody she is physically touching when she uses it on herself."
ability,Kai,How Many Were There Again?,X,,"Kai shifts reality to change how many of an object there is. Costs as much stamina as the number of objects she creates/removes. (43) So That’s Where They Went - When Kai uses “How many were there again?” to remove objects that she didn’t create with the ability, she can spend the same stamina as the number of things she initially removed to re-summon them at her current location. Things she removes carry over between sessions. Furthermore, this ability may now also be used on mook-type enemies, though any removed will reappear where they were removed from after the session is finished."
ability,Kai,Record Scratch,1!,,"Kai influences a target with her epithet, shifting the timing and direction of their attack or ability. This essentially lets them re-roll their action. 78: Record Scratch may now replace the ally’s roll with hers (or the enemy’s with the inverse of her roll) instead of making them re-roll the action if Kai chooses."
ability,Kai,Purge,3,,"Now that Kai has more control of her epithet, she can use it alongside a bit of both holy and demonic magics in order to cleanse impurities from herself or allies. By touching an adjacent ally and using this ability, Kai can apply a number of effects, from healing and removing debuffs, to splitting fusions, forcibly separating possessions, removing dangerous or deadly elements from the body, or even breaking demon contracts or similar effects. "
weapon,Eve,Decorative Buckets,,,"An ornate walking stick that Eve always carries around with him, to cockily smack his opponents with and hold them to the ground. 5 Damage 1 Range."
talent,Eve,Zombified,,,"Because of his unique case of existence, when he is dead Eve is immune to necrotic-based damage, and when he is alive he is immune to life/light based damage."
passive,Eve,Flip-Flop,,,"Because of the unique case of his epithet, everything that can be flipped on his character sheet, is. This includes changing +’s to -’s, and the state of his existence. As such, when at positive stamina, Eve is technically dead, but still able to move around and do things. Similarly, he’s technically alive at negative stamina and can still do things. He can only be defeated by making his stamina exactly 0. Stamina costs and taking damage will always move him towards 0, however his stamina will never go past his ""maximum"" normally (currently 12/-12). Despite what you might expect, Eve’s rolls actually aren’t reversed. Also, among the things reversed is Eve’s Proficiency! This means that whenever Eve “gains” prof, his value decreases. He becomes class 2 at 60 prof, and class 3 at 0 prof."
ability,Eve,Ring Around,1!,,"Eve takes an event that happens, and reverses the actual result of the action. For example, if someone deals 5 damage to him, he could use this to instead make them heal him (or themselves) by 5 stamina. Once per round."
ability,Eve,Negative World,3⛯,,"You know how in his passive it is explicitly stated that his rolls are not reversed? Well part of that is because with this ability, Eve reverses the entire world, causing everyone in combat to roll reversed, and reversing the effects of most buffs/debuffs currently active. Eve may use this as a full round action to not reverse effects on allies. Also, once this round ends initiative will start going in reverse order for the rest of combat. Once per combat."
ability,Eve,Gentle Reminder,2,,"With how many different things there are that could theoretically change on Eve thanks to his epithet, sometimes the universe just kinda… forgets to apply the proper logic. With a few words to remind it, however, Eve can attempt to force the proper change, usually for his team’s benefit. This can generally be as temporary or permanent as Eve wants it, letting him cancel the effects as a free action on his turn if he so desires."
weapon,Jamie,Flurry of Kicks,,,"Jamie attacks a foe with a series of lightning quick kicks, dealing 4 damage at melee range."
talent,Jamie,Footloose,,,"Due to being quick on her feet, Jamie gets an additional two movement spaces on her movement action."
passive,Jamie,"Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee",,,"Whenever she lands a basic attack, Jamie can take advantage of her lightning speed to follow up with an ability at the cost of 1 extra stamina. Furthermore, any ability labeled 'Combo' can be followed up with another 'Combo' ability at no extra cost, assuming the target is in range. A combo ability can only be used once per 'combo'."
passive,Jamie,Double Jump,,,"After a lot of time and effort put into training her abilities, Jamie has learned the confusing and physics-adjacent ability to jump again while in the air! This second jump only gives her vertical distance, however. Having this passive also lets Jamie use Jumping Dolphin while in the air, assuming she hasn’t used her double jump."
passive,Jamie,ADC,,,"While in the middle of a combo or in the air, Jamie can essentially dash 2 spaces in the air to cancel her current actions and reset her ‘combo’, immediately chaining into another one. This costs 2 stamina to do, and can only be done once per round. She does not have to roll for this."
ability,Jamie,Hacky Sack ,1!,,"Jamie kicks to deflect an attack. If deflecting a melee attack, reduces the damage based on roll. If deflecting a projectile attack, sends it away, or sends it back to the attacker on a high roll."
ability,Jamie,Animal Technique,1,,"Jamie learned a few moves from watching masters of various martial focuses fight, including the likes of Kung-Fu. Using this ability has a different effect based on her position in comparison to her target. -Sweeping Crane: Jamie uses the momentum of being sent into the air to twist around and hit her opponent with an aerial roundhouse kick, dealing 3 damage and knocking them 1 space to the side, +some number of extra spaces if the target is in the air. -Pouncing Tiger: Jamie leaps forward with all her strength up to half her movement, kicking her target with both her feet for a devastating hit before landing on the ground, dealing 5 damage and knocking the target back 2 space. -Jumping Dolphin: Jamie performs a vertical sweeping kick on a target next to her, dealing 3 damage and sending a target 10ft up into the air with her. Combo ability."
ability,Jamie,Axel Kick,2,,"Jamie flips forward, kicking all but the heaviest opponents into the ground with the heel of her foot. Deals 4 damage, +2 for every 10 feet the target is launched downward by this attack, and knocks the target into the ground. Combo ability."
ability,Jamie,Battle Trance,3⛯,,"Once per combat. Jamie chooses an opponent and focuses entirely on them, entering a state of extreme focus. Jamie has a +4 to all rolls against the target, but cannot react to anything not involving them. This lasts until the target or Jamie is knocked out. This is a free action on Jamie's turn."
ability,Jamie,Whirlwind Strike,1,,"Jamie builds up momentum, whirling around in a circle and striking a target with multiple kicks in the process. This ability deals 2 damage, and carries the target upwards 5ft if used in the air. This ability can be used in the middle of a combo, or to start one. If Sweeping Crane is used right after this ability, it receives a +3 to success. Combo ability."
ability,Jamie,Support Assist,1!,,"Jamie dashes over to an ally within her movement for a quick assist! This can either be in the form of a basic attack follow up, or a use of Hacky Sack at the cost of 1 extra stamina."
weapon,Joseph,Self Defense Bot v0.5,,,"A simple robot that floats around Joseph to help defend him. It’s still in its early stages, however, so it doesn’t do a lot of damage. 3 Damage 4 Range. (27 Prof) New Model - When Joseph is struck with an idea, he can get to working right away! By using a rolled Bonus Action or an unrolled Movement Action (though he can still roll to potentially get better results), Joseph can start giving an upgrade to his Self Defense Bot v0.5. Specifically, using spare scrap he has on him, materials he finds in a session, and inspiration from the events transpiring around him, he can modify the Self Defense Bot to be specialized and/or enhanced in some way. He pays variable amounts of Stamina to do this (dependent on the desired effect and GM discretion), and it is typically more effective if he is basing it off of something he was directly involved with in the session. From this point onward, Joseph can choose to start combat with the Self Defense Bot in a state he has modified it to be in in the past. Depending on the strength of some of the bot’s modifications, some of its properties may be altered/nerfed when reused in the future."
weapon,Joseph,Martial Arts: Grapple,,,"With a little bit of martial arts experience, Joseph can perform some simple grapples, attempting to either hold a target in place, or throw them a few spaces. He’s not that strong though, so it’s not extremely difficult to break out of a hold. 1 Damage 1 Range."
weapon,Joseph,Jolt Technique,,,"It’s Joseph’s family’s way to keep on the pressure! This attack takes the form of a swift punch or kick, that can potentially inflict up to 2 knockback if Joseph desires. 2 Damage 1 Range. Joseph can combo into this attack from another melee range attack he performs by paying 1 stamina. He can combo it from itself Once per Round."
talent,Joseph,Martial Arts Training,,,"Given that he was raised in a dojo and his twin sister is a martial arts prodigy, naturally Joseph has at least picked up a little bit of it as well. He has decent combat senses, slightly enhanced perception, and has a special additional basic attack"
talent,Joseph,Keep On Your Toes,,,"It’s important to keep light on your feet to allow yourself to flow as quickly as possible. On Joseph’s turn, if he is being targeted by an attack or effect, he can, as a Once per Round Anytime, dodge to an adjacent space. Depending on the interaction, this may cause Joseph to cancel actions he was performing before the dodge."
passive,Joseph,Utility Belt,,,"Joseph has a lot of weird and different inventions he’s constantly trying out, but one of the ones he keeps around at all times is his Utility belt, with a lot of its own functions on it. Most notably, it helps him to keep his balance, produces a shield around him that gives him 1 DR, and most importantly makes it possible for a lot of his technology to actually work, as it is linked through the belt. This means that without this passive, it’s impossible to use any of Joseph’s abilities."
passive,Joseph,It Works Like This!,,,"As a Movement Action or Main Action, Joseph can flick some doodads and attempt to link his Utility Belt to a piece of technology within 4 spaces of him. So long as it remains within 4 spaces of him, Joseph can either attempt to utilize it as a Main Action, or as some kind of a smaller modifier onto other actions he performs."
passive,Joseph,Living Fortress,,,"Joseph's body acts as a dimensional subspace the size of a full medieval castle, as a free action on his turn he can pull anyone who is willing inside for safe storage. People inside the castle cannot be attacked directly while inside but will take 1/5 any damage Joseph takes and the stones shift and are displaced inside him. As part of any action you may pull something out from inside you should you so wish."
ability,Joseph,Eject!,1!,,"Joseph presses a button on his belt, as he is suddenly propelled backwards up to his movement, allowing him to avoid an attack."
ability,Joseph,Shocker Gloves,2,,"Simple gloves that pack a mean punch, when Joseph hits someone with these they take 7 damage as an electric shock is sent through their body. Applies 3 stacks of Shock to a target (if a target rolls under or equal to their current Shock they decay all stacks and take that much damage, and their turn is immediately ended. Decays 1 per round). 22. Hand Buzzer Discharge - If he wants, Joseph can crank the dial on his Shocker Gloves just a liiiiiiiiittle bit too far to overclock it and have electricity spark and chain off of him a tad more than usual. By paying an additional 2 Stamina (which takes the form of electrical damage to Joseph), the Shocker Gloves either: Produce an electric spark wave in a 3x3 in front of Joseph, dealing 5 damage to all units in the area and inflicting them with 2 Stacks of Shock each. OR... Zap the target of Joseph’s punch a little more, dealing 9 damage and inflicting 4 Stacks of Shock, and then having electricity chain off of them to hit all adjacent enemies to the target for 2-3 damage and 1d3 Stacks of Shock each."
ability,Joseph,Strobe Flash Grenade,3!,,"Joseph throws out a grenade that acts as an improvement on normal flash grenades, making a loud sound as it flashes a bunch of times like a strobe light. Deals 2 damage in a 2x2, disorients enemies to give them disadvantage on their next action, and can interrupt actions."
ability,Joseph,Backup Call,X,,"Joseph always has a device on his wrist that he can use to help call in temporary backup from one of the many robots he’s built. This lets him use one of his robot’s abilities, paying the same cost they would have. Once per robot. (Currently valid ones are PSv12.5, Tonn Gunna, and Omega Rosa)"
weapon,Alphy,Deck of Cards,,,Alphy's trusty deck of cards. Damage can be split between targets. 5 Damage 3 Range.
talent,Alphy,Dancer Boy,,,"Alphy is an INCREDIBLE dancer, but this talent is almost completely useless in any capacity. Turns out most people don’t like dancing in their magic shows. Who knew?"
passive,Alphy,Card Trick,,,"Alphy can collapse any reasonably sized object he owns into small cards for easy storage, and restore them when he pleases. This is normally limited to non-living things, but his doves are an exception."
ability,Alphy,Made you Trip!,1,,"Crumble a small part of the ground under an enemy to make them fall over and deal 2 damage. Fallen characters must roll to get up. <7 = They lose their move action; 7-14 = They lose half of their move action, rounded down; 14< = They keep their whole move action. Pitfall - Alphy can now set the effect of Made you Trip! on a space to activate when somebody walks over it."
ability,Alphy,Sleight of Hand,1!,,The Great AB attempts to deftly dodge an incoming attack with one of his signature sleight of hand tricks. A critical success redirects the attack back at the opponent. Once per round
ability,Alphy,Jeremy the Wonder Dove,3⛯,,"Most of The Great AB’s doves are just that: doves. Jeremy, however,  is much more skilled, having gained slightly higher intelligence and a fondness for his owner. Jeremy can be summoned to aid in battle with 10 stamina, 6 movement, and a 3 damage peck. The Great AB can choose to take damage for Jeremy. Jeremy goes back to The Great AB and turns back into a card should either of them be defeated. Once per combat."

weapon,Aquarius,The Shooting Star,,,Aquarius’ bulky and high tech suit of armour. It can punch for 5 damage at melee range.
talent,Aquarius,Arachne Model II Add-on,,,Four additional spider-like arms are added to the back of the Shooting Star. This adds +1 movement and the ability to climb up and position on walls.
passive,Aquarius,Stardust Speedway,,,Everyone on Aquarius’ team (Other than herself) gets +1 movement.
ability,Aquarius,HackThePlan.it ,0,,The reason Aquarius is so good at hacking is because she hacks reality itself. This functionally allows her to modify an object or create a medium-sized object (like things of a bikes size or smaller.). She can use this on her armour.

talent,Guido,"You'll let me choose, RIIIIGHT?",,,Guido can choose his position in turn order.
passive,Guido,You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses would you?,,,"Not that you actually need them but when your scrawny you need everything you can get. If an attack would knock out Guido, the attacker can’t willingly or intentionally target him while he’s wearing his glasses."
ability,Guido,"Hey, you promised!",3⛯,,"Guido makes a deal with an enemy, something he does for them and something they do for him.

weapon,Dalton,Who directly attacks someone else during a duel?,,,"Haven’t you ever heard of good sportsmanship? Instead of a conventional attack, as his main action Dalton can attempt to force one of his dice to land on whatever mark he wants. If successful, after rolling his dice he can replace one of the results with his desired result."
passive,Dalton,Destiny Dice Masters,,,"...or DDM for short is a game made and exclusively played by Dalton Derre. He’s so proud of his game, that he insists he use it in any sort of encounter, and thanks to his epithet, he can! DDM is played with a set of 12 dice, which have symbols known as marks on each of them. At the beginning of each turn, Dalton can pick 3 of his dice and roll them, though he must announce which dice he is using first. Whatever marks they land on are added to his mark pool, which he uses to summon and control his Buds. The six types of marks are: Summon, Attack, Defense, Magic, Trap, and Move. DDM players may have a minimum of 12 monsters corresponding to each of their dice available, but may only summon up to 10 per match. If all 10 are defeated, the player immediately loses and is out of the combat (unless they want to try cheating). Also move marks can be played freely without having to roll, though only one move mark can be used on each Bud per round (unless specified otherwise). The Game MUST Go On! - DDM is no fun if you can’t actually, you know, PLAY it, and unfortunately Dalton’s passive and two of his abilities are tied to being able to play. In order to counteract this, this talent, Dalton’s passive, and his two mark-based abilities can’t be taken away, altered, or copied in any way."
ability,Dalton,"Come on and help me out here, Bud!",1!,,"If Dalton has two of the same levels of summon mark, he can spend them in order to attempt to “dimension” a Bud onto the field. If he has 3 of the same levels of summon mark, he can immediately summon a Bud of that level successfully without having to roll for it. Once per round. The Game MUST Go On! - DDM is no fun if you can’t actually, you know, PLAY it, and unfortunately Dalton’s passive and two of his abilities are tied to being able to play. In order to counteract this, this talent, Dalton’s passive, and his two mark-based abilities can’t be taken away, altered, or copied in any way."
ability,Dalton,The Power of Marks! ,0!,,"Dalton can as a free action spend marks in order to have his Buds act! Move marks allow them to take a movement action, Attack marks allow them to make an attack, Defense marks allow a monster to mitigate some damage, and Magic and Trap marks are used in special abilities. Move, Attack, and Defense Marks cost no stamina to play, but Magic and Trap marks have a cost based on the Bud’s ability. Unless a Bud ability specifies otherwise, only one of each type of mark can be used on a Bud per round. The Game MUST Go On! - DDM is no fun if you can’t actually, you know, PLAY it, and unfortunately Dalton’s passive and two of his abilities are tied to being able to play. In order to counteract this, this talent, Dalton’s passive, and his two mark-based abilities can’t be taken away, altered, or copied in any way."
weapon,Dr. Kilaya,Scalpel,,,"A simple medical tool, wielded with deadly efficiency. Every attack with his scalpels that is successful applies 3 stacks of bleed to the target(s). Bleed causes a target to take damage equal to stacks when rolling for actions, and halves stacks on activation. Decays by half per round."
talent,Dr. Kilaya,Agile Adrenaline Rush,,,"In the face of death, one can often find the sudden strength to attempt to save their life however possible. Jonathan has a free once per round dodge he may use as he wishes, no matter how implausible it should be for a human to dodge. As a result, this dodge cannot be forced to be made with any negative penalties."
talent,Dr. Kilaya,Boundless Energy Stores,,,"As a result of his strenuous training regimens, Jonathan has found enough stores of energy within himself to pull from at the most dire of times. He can no longer be reduced below 5 stamina through stamina costs."
passive,Dr. Kilaya,Here's a Tail for You,,,"Using his epithet, Jonathan has the ability to give people tails with varying properties. All he needs is something to reference for the general shape and base structure/functionality for a basic tail, though with some more time and specific materials he can also infuse a large variety of unique powers into each tail. Some examples include making them detachable, infusing them with elemental power, making them enhance the body of the person with the tail, making them prehensile, etc."
weapon,Aya,Crescent Sin,,,"A unique scythe that Aya wields easily in one hand to deal with enemies that manage to get too close to her. Passes through DR, and can cleave to hit a 3 space line in front of her for 6 damage to each target."
talent,Aya,Unnatural Movements,,,"Due to some influence from her epithet, Aya’s body can just kinda twist and move pretty much however she wants it, to… unsettlingly useful effect. It’s pretty much impossible to trap or restrain her as she can just twist and worm her way out easily, breaking or disabling her limbs does basically nothing to hinder her or her puppets, and due to all of this she also has a natural once per round dodge roll against an incoming attack, as she suddenly jerks herself out of the way."
talent,Aya,Eyes in the Ceiling,,,"Aya has a weirdly… unique way of looking at the world. Not in the sense of how she thinks about things, but rather in the sense of she can shift her vision to a slightly different source, able to see and usually even hear things going on all around her, almost as if she’s somehow looking in from above..."
ability,Aya,New Moon,3,,"Aya quickly sweeps around in a circle with her scythe, magical and epithetical energies flowing out of it as a 2 space radius circle of pure black darkness is created on the floor around her, the area within seeming much darker than the rest of the room. Targets in the area take her full basic attack damage. Anyone that starts their turn in or steps into the area must make a contested roll against Aya. If they fail, thin strings attach to them from above, connecting to their arms, legs, and head among other body parts. On each of Aya’s turns she can attempt to control that ally as if they were one of her puppets, though they get a roll to resist being controlled. Upkeep 2 stamina to keep the area up and around her."
ability,Aya,Altering Space,1,,"Aya has some kind of mysterious magical power at her control that she can use to do a variety of things. She can cause objects and sometimes even people to just disappear. She can create or remove space between things and people, all sorts of weird things. This ability can also be used as an anytime at the cost of 2 extra stamina."
weapon,The Devil,Overwhelming Force,,,"The Devil slashes, thrusts, and generally swings around his electric guitar like a sword, sending his strange flames out and letting them wrap around the instrument. This attack deals 1.5x damage at melee range, and always applies a “Corruption Mark”, regardless of if it hits or not due to the sweeping flames. 8 Damage 5 Range."
talent,The Devil,Firewall,,,"Due to his constant existence dealing with his own cursed flames, The Devil takes half damage from any kind of fire, regular or otherwise."
talent,The Devil,Like Oil and Water,,,"Due to the inherent difference between The Devil’s corrupt flames and normal fire, it’s inherently not “fire” damage, meaning it isn’t resisted nor does it do bonus damage through being “fire”. It doesn’t even mix with regular fire normally, naturally separating itself in the process. Otherwise, it still interacts like normal fire in the sense of burning and melting things."
passive,The Devil,Corrupting Flames of the Void,,,"Due to unknown means, The Devil always seems to have some amount of strange black and purple flames around him at all times. They burn away at anything and everything but himself, more often than not leaving disaster in his wake. In order to avoid destroying everything around him, his flames can only be applied directly to a target either by spreading to them from an existing source, or bursting out from “Corruption Marks” that his flames place on targets. These marks can have various effects depending on how they are used. Marks cannot be destroyed or removed, even through the use of space or time-manipulating effects. If left for a round without new marks being applied, the existing ones will begin to activate. Corruption Marks: Activation - When Corruption Marks activate, dark purple and black flames begin to burst out and envelop the area, burning away at the target’s very being. The intensity and debilitation largely depends on how many marks the target had when they activated: 1 Mark: The target immediately takes 1 damage, and has the flames on that part of them. 2-4 Marks: The target immediately takes 2-4 damage, as well as 2 damage at the start of their turns, as the corrupting flames persist. 5-9 Marks: The target immediately takes 6 damage, as well as 2 damage at the start of their turns, and -2 to damage and rolls on actions that use the part of the body coated in flames. They must roll to resist the flames spreading to more of their body at the beginning of their turns as well. 10+ Marks: The target immediately takes 10 damage, the debuffs listed above, halved movement from the flames eating away at their body, and the flames are much harder to remove than normal. Regardless of how many marks the target had, the flames will persist on their body for an extended amount of time. These flames pierce through any resistances and immunities except for those very specifically targeted at their effect. The flames can be doused like a normal flame, albeit with more difficulty, however if they are allowed to burn on a body part for 2 consecutive rounds, they will begin to leave permanent injuries on the body as they eat away at you, applying permanent debuffs to using that body part. There is currently no known way to heal this, seemingly even through godly omnipotence. The body will very slowly heal naturally as body’s do, but will never reach the same level it was at before. (And by slowly, I mean most likely won’t be naturally healed for the entirety of DBA, or potentially for the character’s entire life, depending on severity)."
passive,The Devil,Flames of Combat,,,"As combat goes on and gets more and more intense, so do The Devil's flames, increasing their damage, area, intensity, and the frequency at which he can use them (along with other hidden passive buffs)."
ability,The Devil,Heartbreaker Medley,3,,"Beginning to strum on Overwhelming Force, the flames around him shift into 4 roughly humanoid forms. Each has 8 stamina, 8 movement, and at the end of The Devil’s next turn they will all explode, dealing 5 damage to all adjacent targets and applying a Corruption Mark to everyone hit. They will not explode if their stamina is reduced to 0, however. This ability may be used as a movement action or a main action."
ability,The Devil,Corruption Chord,1,,"Bonus Action. The Devil strums on his guitar, causing the Corruption Marks on a single target to immediately activate. Can be used twice in one turn, and the first use is a guaranteed success."
ability,The Devil,Spreading Inferno,3,,"Flames flow out from The Devil, spreading low and wide as they lick at the ankles of anyone he wants. Deals 4 damage to all of his enemies as the flames spread across the entire battlefield and remain for a round, dealing 1 more damage for each space enemies move through it, and applying a corruption mark on hit and when they take a movement action."
ability,The Devil,Powered Flow,3,,"The Devil swings Overwhelming Force upwards, causing multiple geysers of flame to explode outwards in a line in front of him. This deals 6 damage in a 3xinfinite line in front of him, each hit applying 2 corruption marks. Afterwards, the flames remain on the ground for a round, acting as difficult terrain and making it so that every space moved through the area applies another corruption mark."
ability,The Devil,Dark Pillar,6,,"An 8 radius area suddenly appears around The Devil, a giant mark appearing on the floor below him as he begins playing a tune on his electric guitar. At the beginning of this turn next round, a giant pillar of flames will suddenly burst out, engulfing enemies in the area in a 20 damage attack that applies 6 corruption marks. While this is charging, The Devil cannot be moved. Twice per Combat."
ability,The Devil,Twisting Shield,1!,,"The flames twist and morph around The Devil, seeming to grab and stop an attack as it comes his way. If the roll for this is significantly higher than the attack it’s blocking, it may apply a corruption mark. Once per Round."
ability,The Devil,Avatar of Flame,2,,"With his incredible control over the flames wreathed around him, The Devil can form them into different shapes and forms, most often giant body parts, in order to fulfill various functions. The damage and effects of this vary wildly depending on what is formed and how he chooses to use it."
weapon,Sion,Fan of Angular,,,"Ever since my blade was so rudely taken away, I’ve had to find new ways to slice and dice. I’ll just throw a few triangles around at various foes, see what they think of my new style~. 12 Damage 7 Range."

talent,Sion,"Up, up and away!!",,,"I mean why not, right? I’ll just float and fly around to my hearts content, and there’s nothing you can do to stop me~"
passive,Sion,I Like Shapes!,,,"Yes it’s true, I really do! Did you know that I can mess around with them? Particularly angular, jagged things are just my favorite! I can even use my free actions to freely control something made of polygonal shapes as I please, even myself! I can only use each shape once though. It’s too bad you don’t count…"

ability,Sion,Angular Whirlwind Two,3,,"I may be tired of my form, but I’ve found the wind does so much better when it’s not me! Take this 3x3 and make sure you don’t step in, or 8 is what you will feel afterwards."
ability,Sion,My Shape Now!,1!,,"Oh no no, did you think that attack would work? I’m so sorry, but I forgot to tell you that your little attempt is now more angular than before, and so I can move it away! Only twice every few seconds or so, though."

Be it a rectangle, square, right or equal triangle, I just can’t resist… I’ll hit you all with my angles as I dash around your bodies, how about? It doesn’t even have to be you, any shape works, really~"
talent,Brainfuck,Red Light Green Light,,,"As a bonus action, Brainfuck braces herself and feels all eyes on her. This takes until her next turn to activate. The main text of the ability is not shown until it procks. If at the start of her turn, none of the eyes in the PC icons are looking at her, brainfuck gets double her usual movement. However, if someone is looking at her, she loses her movement. Characters with dot eyes do not count, because as we all know, those beady little things see all yet nothing."
passive,Brainfuck,Elon Musk's Very Good Idea,,,"If Brainfuck crashes the Cybertruck even the slightest amount, the car explodes into a ball of fire and shrapnel, and Brainfuck dies instantly.  What the fuck were those people thinking.  This car is a horrifying and unsafe waste of money and every cent of its creator’s wealth should be forcibly donated to charity.  Capitalism is a disease."
passive,Brainfuck,What Are These “Consequences of My Actions” You Speak Of?,,,Brainfuck has no ability costs because she would just kill herself from cost alone and I ain’t dealing with that shit.
ability,Brainfuck,I’ve Got This! uwu,0,,Brainfuck does something stupid.
ability,Brainfuck,Popup Window,0,,Brainfuck pulls open a popup window that blocks view of some of the map infront of her. The window automatically disappears after she goes under it.
ability,Brainfuck,Randomly generated!,0!,,"Brainfuck looks up a random word in her “asset list” (roll20 search function) and uses the first result in some way to “help” her. If there is no result, she can keep rolling until she gets one. Once per round."
ability,Brainfuck,Shift Into Maximum Overdrive!!,0,,"Brainfuck shifts the Cybertruck into Maximum Overdrive! Or at least she thinks she does. Brainfuck pulls the parking brake, causing the Cybertruck to lose its movement action until someone can get over there to turn it off."
ability,Brainfuck,Brainfuck’s 8 funny characters!,0,,"Brainfuck rolls a random character from her list of 8 characters. She then does something based on the command. 1: > moves something forward. 2: < moves something backwards. 3: + increases the size of something. 4: - decreases the size of something. 5: . increases a number. 6: , saves a roll to use later. 7: [ moves something in a random direction the next time someone fails an action. 8: ] the next time the cyber truck would run into a trap, it moves backwards a single space."
weapon,Xavier,Bloom & Blossom,,,"Xavier’s go-to, golden, dual pistols with rose engravings. 5 damage 4 range.They’re built to be able to load and fire specialized bullets: allowing Xavier to add extra, elemental properties onto all of his shots. Similarly, he has a reserve of “Anti-Epithet Bullets”, that do not completely neutralize an Epithet on their own, but are able to variably reduce one’s effectiveness. If Xavier wants to utilize any of these special bullets (whether in this Basic Attack or in Abilities utilizing his pistols), he must pay an additional 1 Stamina. (Prof 14) A Bullet For Every Occasion - As part of Xavier’s skill increasing, so too has his tools for the trade. As of recent with the Epithet Technology developing and such, there’s been a new advent for gunslingers like him; Named Bullets. These bullets allow Xavier to ask someone to flare some of their Epithet energy into the pack of bullets, causing all of them to become infused with the energies of that Epithet. As of current, Xavier has 3 packs of these bullets and may initially ask any one Epithet user he has ever become acquainted with to infuse a pack, but from then on he must ask an Epithet User in something he’s in. From this point on, he may add this to his list of ‘Special Bullets’ which he can pay 1 Stamina to use. These bullets are assumed to refill between Sessions and he never seems to run out. Xavier can also ricochet ANY bullet he fires, but to less effectiveness than with An Interesting Angle."
weapon,Xavier,Old Hand Cannon,,,"This weapon was gifted to him by Unice, who received it from a Data Bounty. Xavier may fire this handheld hand cannon, which along with its damage, inflicts 5 spaces of knockback."
talent,Xavier,Level Headed,,,"Xavier knows how to stay cool under pressure. It’s not only more difficult to inflict him with mental based effects, but he also is able to stave off other status effects far more easily than normal, always keeping calm and figuring out how to deal with the situation."
talent,Xavier,Fastest Gun,,,"C’mon, guys, of course he’s the fastest gun. He’s not gonna be an ace, crack shot detective with slow hands, after all. If there is ever any question on who could attack, draw a weapon, or do something first: it’s always Xavier (excluding any giga speedster characters). This also lets Xavier interact with objects with much more finesse than other characters, as well as having more time to equip, unequip and interact with many more objects in a turn. This also explains him having a negligible reload time. This Talent also functions as him always being considered to do any state-based action that would be positive (I.E. If something Xavier needs is inside of a toilet and not generically ‘on’ the toilet, it is simply assumed that he opens the toilet if he searches around it)."
passive,Xavier,Bullet Time,,,"In a moment’s time, Xavier will concoct a plan to finish you. Whenever Xavier lands a particularly powerful blow or dodges an attack, time seems to slow down as he can attempt to launch a variable volley of bullets in a path of his choice. Performing particularly stylish maneuvers utilizing Bullet Time can grant Xavier ""Detective Ranks"", which can spent to either generically increase damage by hitting weak points or to allow Xavier to extrapolate his actions to a more extreme degree, setting up JoJo Style Secret Action Chains or allowing him to be more of an anime cool guy."
ability,Xavier,Let's Perform An Investigation!,X,,"Xavier quickly analyzes the current situation, his eyes honing in on details like reticles. This allows him to place up to 3 “Clues” onto either units of his choice or onto the battlefield itself (within eyesight). If placed on an enemy, Xavier is able to spot a weak point on them, or some other potential weakness they have, making it Xavier and his allies have increased damage/effectiveness when attacking/utilizing it. If placed on an ally, Xavier gets a better understanding of their form and is able to help direct them to be more effective, granting them variable and potentially invisible roll buffs and effectiveness modifiers. If placed somewhere else in the battlefield, the exact effect of the Clue may vary, but it typically allows Xavier/his allies to make use of various objects more effectively or helps them understand the exact positioning/properties of affected things. Clues last for 1-2 Rounds. Stamina Cost is dependent on severity."
ability,Xavier,An Interesting Angle,3,,"After spinning his pistols, Xavier fires a particularly volatile pair of shots outward. These shots have an additional 4 Range compared to Bloom & Blossom (and potentially more damage). They can ricochet off of one target/object into another, granting them extra spaces of range in the process. Depending on exactly what Xavier does, bullets fired this way can be left ricocheting past his turn, acting as traps or as some other form of persistent effect. Xavier cannot use Anti-Epithet Bullets with An Interesting Angle. Damage may be proliferated over time."
ability,Xavier,Golden Opportunity,2!,,"In the middle of the action, Xavier sees the perfect chance to land a devastating blow. He rolls or jumps up to 3 spaces in any direction, dodging attacks in the process, and then fires a particularly accurate, pinpoint shot with his pistols. Once per Round."
weapon,Tohil,Fists of Fury,,,Years of training have turned Tohil’s fists into brutal weapons. Deals 7 damage at 1 range. (Prof 30) Furious Rush - +2 weapon damage (5 to 7). Tohil’s basic attack gains Start Step 3.
talent,Tohil,Slow Drip,,,"Tohil passively summons vein system copies (detailed in Cardiac Arrest), specifically she creates 1 a turn. (These seemingly levitate around as 1 stamina summons, each with 8 movement. They can’t perform any of Tohil’s abilities or attack on their own, but they can wrap around and hold things, and they can spend an action to “enter” something, either inserting the veins into a nonliving object or overlaying itself over another person’s vein system. From there the summon can’t be hit easily, and it can use its action to control the object. On top of that, Tohil can spend her movement to teleport herself on top of one of her vein system summons that isn’t within something already (so no telefragging). This doesn’t need a roll, and technically changes her blood since she’s effectively replacing her current system with the copy, meaning she also leaves behind a vein summon in her original position. Teleporting like this consumes 1 stamina however since it’s rather painful.)"
talent,Tohil,"She Has Had Two Coffees, Three Coffees, Elevel Cof- Oh Fuck That’s Twenty Seven- Tohil Please Stop You’re Scaring Me",,,"Tohil’s epithet causes her constant throbbing pain in her entire vascular system! Bummer! On the bright side, it literally can’t get any worse from here! Tohil drinks an absurd amount of caffeine to energize herself enough to get through the day, and this makes it basically impossible for her to be affected by sleep, drowsiness, tranquilizers, dizzying effects, and breaks in concentration. Not even magic can put this lady down! Oh no. She’s also generally resistant to pain based effects."
passive,Tohil,Go For The Jugular,,,"Tohil fights brutally and with speed. If she manages to connect with her basic weapon attack, she gets an additional movement action and non-weapon main action for this turn. This can only trigger once per round."
passive,Tohil,Blood Boiling,,,"Tohil can use her epithet to manipulate her own veins for power. By increasing the flow and heat of her veins, she can literally boil it inside her. Whenever she spends stamina costs on anything, she can move an equivalent number of spaces as a Start Step or End Step to that effect by jettisoning steam from parts of her body. These dashes are omnidirectional, letting her move through the air."
passive,Hito Hito no mi Model: Skeleton,Animal Hybrid: Skeleton,,,"This fruit is one of a handful that grants their user the ability to completely or partially turn into an animal/different species which grants a few benefits. It requires a move action to go up or down a level. Hybrid: Tohil’s endoskeleton becomes an exoskeleton, acting as armor built around her instead of being inside. This grants her +1 DR. However, she has halved healing from sources other than milk. Full: The user’s skin and organs completely disappear, leaving only a skeletal body behind! Tohil has +2 DR, can reattach any part of her that becomes removed, and has immunity to disease and poisons! However, Tohil also can no longer heal from sources other than milk."
passive,Hito Hito no mi Model: Skeleton,Bone Marrow,,,"While in human form, Tohil’s bone marrow becomes significantly more efficient, even within her body, granting her fast healing 1. She also receives +1 healing from all sources in human form."
ability,Tohil,Cardiac Arrest,1,,"Tohil creates 2-4 copied instances of her own blood vessel system. These seemingly levitate around as 1 stamina summons, each with 8 movement. They can’t perform any of Tohil’s abilities or attack on their own, but they can wrap around and hold things, and they can spend an action to “enter” something, either inserting the veins into a nonliving object or overlaying itself over another person’s vein system. From there the summon can’t be hit easily, and it can use its action to control the object. On top of that, Tohil can spend her movement to teleport herself on top of one of her vein system summons that isn’t within something already (so no telefragging). This doesn’t need a roll, and technically changes her blood since she’s effectively replacing her current system with the copy, meaning she also leaves behind a vein summon in her original position. Teleporting like this consumes 1 stamina however since it’s rather painful."
ability,Tohil,JUST! SHUT! UP!,1,,"Tohil grabs an adjacent enemy, jumps into the air, and proceeds to slam them against the floor. This deals 4 damage, and if the roll were 13 or more than the target bounces up high enough for her to use this ability again immediately, although that does require them to pay stamina again."
ability,Tohil,Blood Bond,1!,,"Tohil’s own veins launch out from her wrists, attaching to a target within 5 range. This can be used as a lasso for various purposes, or alternatively can drain blood from a target to deal 3 damage and heal her for 3 stamina. Once per round."
ability,Tohil,I’ll Make You Feel Pain,1,,"Tohil may move one of her current vein copies towards a target and have it latch its own blood into the central nervous system of a target, magnifying their pain centers. This consumes the copy, however the next attack on this enemy now deals double its usual damage (this can only add a maximum of an additional 10 damage to an attack)."
ability,Tohil,Grind to Dust,3,,"Tohil grabs a target and slams them into the ground. She may then move up to her movement in any direction, getting to add any unspent movement or any Start or End step effects still pending to this. While she moves she drags the enemy on the floor, dealing 1 damage per space dragged (this collectively only adds any damage bonuses once to the hit) before throwing the target into the air, letting Tohil perform a follow-up attack so long as it’s an action she hasn’t done yet this round. Recharge 5-6."
ability,Hito Hito no mi Model: Skeleton,Bone Blades,1,,"By controlling her skeleton, blades made of bones come out of Tohil’s arms like tonfas. These extremely sharp weapons deal 6 damage at 1 range and apply 2 stacks of Bleed. At the start of that person’s turn, they take damage equal to the amount of Bleed they have on them and lose 1 Bleed."
ability,Hito Hito no mi Model: Skeleton,Bone Zone,3,,"Tohil causes bones to erupt around her in a 5x5 area centered around herself. This deals 3 damage to all enemies within this space. The bones stay around, and everyone other than Tohil treats this space as difficult terrain, spending double the movement to move a single space in it. Tohil can only have one Bone Zone active at once, dismissing her old one upon using this ability."
weapon,River,I'm Not Exactly A Fighter,,,"River does some kind of untrained, improvised physical attack. Deals 4 damage 1 range."
talent,River,Mental Intrusion,,,"River is not doing so well in the head. This gives them a vulnerability to psychic damage, and makes mental manipulation and mind control-esque powers more effective against them. You may take this in addition to another talent."
passive,River,One Smart Cookie,,,"River’s sharp wits outpace and make up for his actual combat ability. In addition to their normal action economy, River has access to an additional action called a Deduction Action. This action can only be used in place of any other action economy, and if an anytime is used with a Deduction Action its once per round is not used. However, Deduction Actions can only do things that are purely mental. As an action River can attempt to analyze someone or something, making a knowledge check for 1-3 Knowledge Points towards that target (maybe more or less if they are especially familiar or unfamiliar with the subject). They can spend 1 KP to notice or learn some other useful information about the target. Other kit features will spend KP, in which case it is only spent on a success. Lastly: River can “Identify” kit features or items as an additional anytime ability granted by this passive. This reveals any text of that kit feature that hasn’t been revealed yet. Certain kit features of his work especially well against Identified things. Once 50% or more of a target’s kit has been Identified, the rest of their kit becomes Identified automatically. River treats their own entire mundie kit as Identified. Identify (1!) - River focuses down on a target and Identifies one of their kit features they’ve seen, or an item in the area. This grants 1 KP if successful. Once per round."
ability,River,Be Careful!,1!,,"River can use this ability to either try and dodge an incoming attack with some foresight, or warn an ally of an incoming attack. The self dodge version, if successful, grants River 1-2 KP. The ally version requires you to spend KP but can grant you varying levels of benefits depending on how much you spend. 1 KP simply lets the ally perform a dodge roll. 3 KP allows them to attempt a counter-attack. 5 KP gives them the standard dodge, but doesn’t consume the once per round limitation on this ability. This ability rolls advantage when dodging Identified kit features. Once per round."
ability,River,Really Good Intuition,X,,"Additional cost: X KP on a single target. X caps at 5. River narrows down his vision and seriously focuses down on a target, attempting to predict their next move. The target of your prediction must now reveal what their next course of action is, and cannot change this unless a significant change in the scenario has made them want to take a different course of action. River may spend up to 5 KP from that target to predict even further ahead, such as their contingency plans should their current goal become unavailable, where and how they’ll move, what abilities they’ll use on who, etc. At 5 KP this ability essentially gives you complete insight on their next turn. This ability cannot predict kit features you’ve yet to see unless you are spending 5 KP, in which case it Identifies all of them ahead of time."
ability,River,Attack Its Weak Point For Massive Damage,1,,"By spending 3 KP, River can identify a weak point, damage vulnerability, or kit deficiency on the target, or inversely discover any special defenses the target has. Once per combat per person the target instead gains one that even they didn’t know about for the combat. All weaknesses determined by this become 1.5x as bad if either the thing causing them is Identified, or if the entire kit of the target is Identified."
ability,River,Counter Measure,1,,"River quickly brews up a counter strategy against an Identified thing. This gives them some kind of automatic set of actions they perform when exposed to the appropriate part of that Identified thing, however each time it activates River must spend 1 stamina if they wish to use it. River can give one of their counter strategies to an ally as a bonus action."
talent,Parasite,Flesh Drone,,,"Parasite continues to move River’s body long after they should lose consciousness. While in your falsehood kit, you can continue to act and spend stamina while below 1 stamina. Your death range is also increased to your falsehood’s proficiency or your normal death range, whatever is better. However you can still die if defeated. If you return to your mundie kit while below your normal death range in stamina, you are set to 1 away from death instead of dying on the spot."
talent,Parasite,This Body Is OURS,,,"Inversely to River, Parasite’s mental control is unparalleled. She has immunity to psychic damage, extreme resistance to mental effects even when successful, and she always has primary control of the body if an external influence would try to take it over. You can make a counter roll with advantage against anything that forces you to act, or stop them outright as a guaranteed success if their proficiency is less than your Falsehood’s proficiency. In addition, no mental effect can stop Parasite from moving into her Falsehood kit."
passive,Parasite,Parasitoid Infection,,,"Parasite feasts on others, draining them for her own benefit. Whenever they succeed on an action, they can lower the effectiveness of the action to gain that much of their red stat: Lifeblood. Their max Lifeblood is equal to their falsehood proficiency. They can’t decrease numerics in a way that is positive to them, nor can they reduce something to zero. They can also convert beneficial statuses and buffs on them into Lifeblood at will. In addition to their normal action economy, Parasite has access to an additional action called a Parasite action. This action can’t be the same as another action you’ve already done or are going to do this turn, and Parasite actions can’t be reduced in effectiveness to gain red stat. Instead they can spend Lifeblood to increase the potency or numerics of Parasite actions. This can be done before and/or after their roll. Lastly, whenever a Parasite action deals damage to an enemy, that enemy gains a stack of Parasitoid. Each of these stacks drains the target for 1 stamina at the start of their turns, and then if River is not in their falsehood kit it decays by 1. Other than that, specialized action is required to remove them. "
ability,Parasite,Blood Extortionist,4,,"Parasite reaches towards a target within 2 range and pulls out their blood (or equivalent) from their body, and with it some of their essence. This lets them form a sick ass weapon out of their blood, empowered by their spirit and powers. This deals an initial damage equal to half the die roll rounding up (which pierces DR), and in return gives you a weapon with damage and range collectively equal to that number +4 (caps at 14 stats), split how you choose. It also has potent extra properties. However every round you are not in your falsehood kit the weapon’s stats degrade by a collective 3, and it disappears once it reaches 0 in one of its stats. This ability can be used as a bonus action at no cost with advantage when targeting yourself. While in your falsehood kit as a guaranteed success bonus action, Parasite may inhale the weapon converting it back into blood and healing for its collective stat total."
ability,Parasite,Epiphyte Equation,3,,"Parasite’s power causes all nearby life to be drained, funneling their blood and life force into themself. This deals 3 damage (which pierces DR) to all valid targets within 3 range of Parasite, and heals them for 1 stamina per target effected. This can get you extra lifesteal if other living things are nearby such as plants. Friendly fire."
ability,Parasite,HAHAHAHAHAH,1!,,"Instead of dodging an incoming attack Parasite immediately acts, irreverent to the consequences. This allows them to immediately attempt an action to fuck up their assailant. Sometimes this can be a clash of weapons to cause both attacks to clank off of each other, in which case you can use this anytime again until end of turn. Other times Parasite will directly accept an attack from an enemy, taking the effect of a full success to do something in return. For these actions you roll again, but can use either that roll or the roll for this ability whichever is better. Once per round."
ability,Parasite,Mindslaver,X,,"Parasite extends a hand at a target with a Parasitoid and bombards them with overwhelming psychic commands. The target can choose: spend X stamina and attempt a counter-roll to resist, spend XX stamina to resist automatically, or simply choose to fail. If you choose to fail then you cannot use reactions to attempt to stop this effect. If this effect succeeds, that target must immediately take a main and move action according to your demands."
weapon,Byte,Byteblade,,,"A blade of electricity extending from two of Bytes fingers held together. Deals 4 damage at 2 range. This attack additionally applies 1 stack of LC shock, and electricity can be spent on this attack to boost the damage or range at a 1:1 ratio"
talent,Byte,8-Bit Madness,,,"For those that don’t know, a byte is a computer unit composed of 8 bits, each used to determine some amount of information. In the case of Byte as a person, they used that knowledge to develop a personal special technique. Once per session, Byte may choose to take any of their actions that include “Byte” within the name and convert it into an “8-Bit” attack instead, halving the effectiveness but causing the attack to go off 8 times at no additional cost, all using the same individual roll. These attacks must be spread out between targets in range if possible, but Byte can determine how."
talent,Byte,Zzzzzap!,,,"While his electricity stat is positive, volatile energy flows through and around Byte’s body, affecting those that come into contact with him. Any physical contact made with Byte while he is charged deals 1 electric damage, applies 1 stack of shock, and applies 1 stack of Digitize if the target doesn’t already have one. If contact is sustained over multiple rounds of combat, the effect ticks once per round on the target’s turn, increasing the electric damage and shock by 1 each round as well."
passive,Byte,Electricity Vampire,,,"Due to extensive experimentation and efforts, Byte’s body isn’t exactly… normal, anymore. Most of his insides are super fucked up, and a lot of it is quite literally electricity that he needs to survive. Byte heals from any electricity damage that he would take as it charges up his body, however he is particularly weak to insulating materials. Furthermore, as an action he can drain energy from any technology relatively close to him, healing himself and empowering him. Any charge that he gains from electric damage or draining technology gets put into an electricity stat at a 1:1 ratio. Byte can use this stat to supplement stamina costs, or empower abilities at set intervals. So long as he has at least some electricity stat, Byte also gains doubled movement and a +2 to rolls. The downside to this is that electricity drains by 2 points per round, and it can go into the negatives. If electricity stat is ever in the negatives, then Byte instead has a -2 to rolls and halved movement, along with his abilities being weakened. Electricity cannot go below negative his max stamina, or above his normal max stamina."
ability,Byte,Static Bit,1,,"Byte lightly touches an adjacent target, giving them a small zap of static charge. This applies 3 LC shock and 1 stack of Digitize. Electricity can be spent on this ability to increase the shock applied by 1 for every 2 electricity spent. Byte cannot increase a target’s shock past 8 with this ability."
ability,Byte,Byte-Cruncher,3,,"Byte reaches out a finger, and lets loose a bolt of burning digital electricity, zapping a target within 6 spaces for 10 damage and applying 1 stack of Digitize. For every 2 electricity spent on this a stack of LC shock is also applied, and for every 3 spent the damage is increased by 1. The effect of Digitize from this attack also spreads to adjacent spaces, causing the environment to become more pixelized and digital and creating difficult terrain."
ability,Byte,Pixelize,1!,,"Byte quickly jolts a nearby target or himself, allowing him to bend and change their form temporarily to avoid an attack. The target of this is left with a stack of Digitize afterwards. Once per Round."
weapon,Danica,Compact Close Combat,,,A simple punch or kick can do the trick if nothing else works. 7 Damage 1 Range
weapon,Danica,Polished Pistol,,,"Danica’s preferred method of attack. She just shoots someone. Pretty efficient if you ask her. 4 Damage 6 Range. (Prof 27) Reflect Shot - Bullets can ricochet off of a maximum of 3 solid surfaces (So not like, human skin or whatever). The range resets after each ricochet."
talent,Danica,Bullhorn Vocals,,,"One of Danica’s core traits is her ability to command the room. Part of this is due to how loud her voice can be if she wants. Danica’s voice can pierce through most natural sound barriers and other forms of preventing her voice from being heard. Epithet/supernatural ways of blocking noise still affects her, but good luck ever soundproofing a wall to prevent yourself from hearing her voice. Additionally, if someone is deaf/sound resistant/sound immune, they’re still able to hear her voice as vibrations within themselves."
talent,Danica,A Name of Infamy,,,"Danica’s name throughout the criminal underworld, so people already know to fear her. She has an invisible passive intimidation buff on people associated with the criminal underworld whatsoever, and people with this description start the combat with 1 Menace."
passive,Danica,A Boss to be Feared,,,"Danica’s a well known boss in the criminal underworld, and many people have heard her name. But even for those who have no idea who she is, one look at her will give the impression that she is not to be trifled with. Every time she damages a target, they gain a stack of “Menace”. Menace indicates that the target begins to realize more and more that Danica is not to be trifled with. Any targets with Menace will be unable to willingly be within X spaces of Danica, X being the number of Menace divided by 2 rounded down. Additionally, Danica can spend 5 Menace on a target to lock them in place completely during her turn, making them unable to move or use anytimes during the duration of Danica’s turn."
passive,Danica,Pact of the Power Seed,,,"Danica’s Biomyth physicality greatly influences her fighting style and how she conducts herself in combat. She has all the benefits and drawbacks of being a Draconic Dragonfruit, listed below: Using her wings, she can use any of her movement to fly. She naturally resists water, electric, and plant-based attacks. However, she takes 1.5x damage/other effects from air, poison, ice, magic, and draconic elemental attacks. Her sight, smell, and sound is boosted beyond what a normal human’s probably is, giving her the usual benefits that come with these heightened senses as well as a +3 bonus to perception checks. However, these increased senses can be taken advantage of. She is naturally exceptionally greedy, and will impulsively steal and hoard shiny things for herself."
ability,Danica,Draconic Greenade,3,,"With a manic grin, Danica rapidly grows a glowing red dragon fruit in her hand, which she chucks up to 7 spaces. Upon landing in her desired spot, it will detonate in a 3x3 area, dealing 6 damage to everyone inside and knocking them back 3 spaces in an opposite direction from the blast. This ability has friendly fire."
ability,Danica,Draconic Wildfire,2,,"With a deep inhale, Danica musters all of the firepower she can manifest inside of herself, then exhales a massive indigo burst of flame. This flame is a 5x3 cone which deals 4 damage to anyone caught in it. On high rolls, this will place 1d3 stacks of Burn. (Prof 29) Draco Flamethrower - By paying 1 Extra Stamina, Draconic Wildfire can be used during Danica’s move action, provided she keeps her head pointed in one direction during said move action."
ability,Danica,Death Glare,1!,,"In response to an attack she can see, Danica gives a horrifying death stare at the user of the attack, causing them to stop right in their tracks before they can follow through. This automatically puts 2-3 Menace on the target. This can only be activated if Danica can make eye contact with the target of this ability, and it has to be in response to an attack or ability they’re doing. Once per Round."
weapon,Lloyd,Stylish Silver Scissors,,,"A giant pair of garden scissors made of solid silver. These are normally very dangerous to cut hair with, but with Lloyd’s power, they’re actually quite safe to use! They’re still pretty dangerous, though. 5 Damage 2 Range."
talent,Lloyd,What a Charming Young Man,,,"Lloyd’s natural sing-songy voice and high charisma can leave a favorable impression on most people. Therefore, his charisma checks are greatly boosted and he is able to more easily convince people to do things."
ability,Lloyd,Little Known Facts,X,,"Lloyd, in his sweet yet arrogant manner, casually mentions a scientific fact. Little do his enemies know that this fact is explicitly false, but it’s not like they’re ever going to notice, as the fact immediately becomes true for the rest of the combat because of the influence of Lloyd’s Epithet. The cost is dependent on how great the effect is, and the ability is more successful the more “proof” Lloyd mentions to convince others that this fact is true. (Prof 17) Peer Studies - Lloyd gains the ability to utilize Little Known Facts as a Bonus Action on rolls of 10+. Additionally, Once per Combat, an ally may use Little Known Facts on their own turn, but whatever effect they will make will be weaker than what Lloyd is capable of. The enemy side also gets their own usage of it as well, again with weaker results. These follow the restrictions of Lloyd’s original ability, facts made by different people cannot cancel each other out, and Lloyd can choose to keep these facts via his passive."
ability,Lloyd,Scientifically Impossible,X,,"As an attack or an action that would prove to be unfavorable to Lloyd is happening, Lloyd quickly exclaims that actually, due to an aspect of the attack or action, it isn’t able to exist. This cancels the attack as is for 1d3 rounds, and the aspect that is not possible cannot be performed by anyone else for that time. However, if the ability can be performed in a way that goes around using that aspect that has been “disproven”, it can be used in that way. The cost is dependent on how significant or plausible the cancellation is. Once per Round. "
ability,Lloyd,Ambiguous Chemical Grenade,1,,"Lloyd may be a barber, but just for this special occasion at the Destruction Bench Agreement, he’ll bring along some extra firepower. Lloyd tosses a canister filled with a pure element of some kind within 5 range. This deals 3 damage, and has an additional effect depending on what element it is. If an element is not under the effect of one of Lloyd’s lies, then the roll to toss it gets a +3, but 20’s will not get Lloyd proficiency. However, lies could affect its already existing characteristics depending on what it is. Hydrogen - Element number 1, and also an extremely flammable gas. Deals 2 damage at the start of the target’s turn for every 1d3 rounds due to inhalation, and fire attacks during that time hit with 1.5 damage. Carbon - One of the hardest elements in its purified diamond form, it has nothing too flashy with it, but it does hit hard! Therefore, it deals x2 damage. Gold - The standard shiny element purified to its shiniest state. It doesn’t do much, but the shininess will give its target a -3 to their next 1d3 rolls due to blindness. Uranium - A highly dangerous chemical with intense radiation, and is only really carried by Lloyd due to the fact that the glass he’s carrying is radiation-proof. Once broken, however, the target takes 1 radiation damage every round and loses 2 movement for 1d3 rounds. Unknown Element - This mysterious glowing blue liquid element seems to be unlike anything anyone has seen on Earth before. It doesn’t seem to innately do anything, but any roll Lloyd makes to alter it with lies has a +5."
ability,Lloyd,One in a Million,2+X,,"There are various odd conditions and ailments within people that effect their well being and daily life. And Lloyd has… some! Lloyd essentially makes up a condition that they have, altering their physiology in some way. However, Lloyd can’t be the only one who has whatever he gave himself, right? If an effect that was used by this ability is active, everyone rolls a die to attune to the fact, potentially giving themselves the condition. Lloyd must mention how common the condition is, which will determine the die size and the range other people must get in order to receive the condition (ex. Lloyd says a condition shows up in 1/5 people, so everyone rolls a d5, and a 5 will give them the condition). The more common the condition, the easier the roll to succeed is. X equals the amount of Conditions Lloyd has on himself currently, plus any extra cost the GM deems necessary if the condition is especially powerful. Bonus Action."
weapon,Mata,Stone Fist,,,"A powerful blow, enhanced by Mata’s ludacris strength. 8 Damage 1 Range."
weapon,Mata,Standard Pistol,,,The standard weapon carried by most Bloodstone Officers. 4 Damage 6 Range.
passive,Mata,Pure Muscle,,,"Mata is quite a formidable figure, built like a brick wall. This inherent strength grants him advantage on strength checks, and any forceful contact with him (Such as punches, kicks, etc.) will deal 3 recoil damage due to Mata’s incredibly solid musculature. It’s also hard to forcefully move him."
ability,Mata,Persistent Rush,2,,"Mata rushes forward in a straight line, moving 2x his normal speed. If someone is within his path, he can knock them out of the way for 5 damage and 3 knockback. This is incredibly hard to stop, Mata’s momentum just can’t seem to be stopped. Move Action."
ability,Mata,Supertoss,1,,"Mata simply chucks something at someone else, far more efficiently than someone else can. This ability, and other strength capabilities, allow Mata to treat something that is up to a 2x2 as a small object when throwing it."
ability,Mata,Just Suplex Them,2,,"And suplex them Mata will. Mata grapples an adjacent unit and slams them into the ground, knocking them Prone and dealing 9 damage to them. On high rolls this will inflict Topple instead."
ability,Mata,Bump,1,,"If there are any adjacent units towards him, Mata uses his incredibly solid frame to bump them out of the way, knocking them back 3 spaces. Bonus Action."
weapon,Mike,Tools of the Trade,,,"Mike has a collection of tools he can utilize to not only build stuff, but hurt people who are attacking him. The tools he is most handy in when it comes to defending himself are as follows: Wrench (5 Damage, 1 Range) - A sturdy wrench that Mike has been using for a long time, though it still works just as good as it ever did. Hitting someone with it will also deal damage to them. Inflicts Prone and 2 Bleed. Nail Gun (3 Damage, 5 Range) - Mike fires a nail gun as if it’s a projectile, and it works. Inflicts 3 Bleed on hit units. Because of its rapid-fire nature, Mike can hit two different targets with this attack in one action. Drill (7 Damage, 1 Range) (⚅) - Mike’s handy drilling device. Incredibly painful if jabbed into people. The ferocity of this attack inflicts Surprise on hit units. Recharge 5-6."
weapon,Mike,These Hands,,,Last resort when shit hits the fan. It’s a punch. Die. (3 Damage 1 Range).
ability,Mike,Speed Trap,1,,"Mike takes out some bottles of grease he has on his person and pours it over a 2x3 area, making that area incredibly slippery and flammable. It will remain until explicitly gotten rid of, even past the end of combat."
ability,Mike,I Saw This Trick in a Video,X,,"Mike watches a lot of Youtube videos in his spare time, featuring various weird video game challenges amongst other things. Watching these types of videos has subconsciously affected his fighting/driving style. While taking any other kind of action, Mike can implement some kind of effect/maneuver from a DougDoug video the player has seen. These effects can be heavily extrapolated, provided it makes some level of sense. Stamina cost is dependent on severity. Bonus Action."
ability,Mike,Tinkering Away,X,,"Mike begins doing his mechanic thing, using parts on hand/parts from around the field to either build a small machine or to Repair (Healing but only for machines/structures/inorganic entities) something adjacent to him. Stamina cost is dependent on severity, but will be generally lower if Mike uses stuff he finds on the field rather than nebulous items he brought with him."
weapon,Amber Aquaplane,Amber Cannon,,,"Loadable. A solid ball of amber launched like a cannonball. 6 Damage, 15 Range."
talent,Amber Aquaplane,Amphibious Vessel,,,"The Amber Aquaplane, true to its name, is able to not only fly, but traverse water as well! To accommodate, the vehicle can retract its wings while on land or in water, and lift off as an unrolled Bonus Action. Its passive coating is also waterproof, making it immune to water/liquid damage (Although it is still vulnerable to force damage, meaning some water-based attacks can still work via pressure with only some resistance). Water is additionally treated as a preferred terrain."
passive,Amber Aquaplane,Amber Seal,,,"The Amber Aquaplane is coating in a veil of solid amber, making it impervious to weaker hits. If the Amber Aquaplane gets into a clash with another attack (Be it via contested rolls, being anytimed, or otherwise) and wins, it is considered in that moment to have 5 Physical DR for the rest of the turn. Additionally, the amber coating is made to have a veil of honey at its rim that reacts to friction, absorbing attacks. Therefore, attacks that fail this way and trigger the DR, provided they are tangible, will get absorbed into the vessel, and can be used to change and augment some of the Aquaplane’s kit features if they are marked with Loadable. (Note: If it is a melee attack rather than a projectile, the kinetic force will be absorbed instead)."
ability,Amber Aquaplane,Treesap Lasso,1!,,"Out of one of its cannons, the Amper Aquaplane shoots out a rope of sticky honey and sap, allowing it to tether and grapple onto other things. Once per Round."
ability,Amber Aquaplane,Gooey Gatling,3,,"Loadable. The Amber Aquaplane launches out 1d5+2 blobs of honey within 10 spaces. These globs are incredibly sticky, and can only be escaped from via a contested move action (with a -4 to the roll), or by appropriate actions being done to get free. Multiple globs can be launched at any target, increasing the effectiveness and difficulty to escape, but the effectiveness proliferates with the number of globs."
ability,Amber Aquaplane,Fossilized Firebomb,3,,"Loadable. The Amber Aquaplane fires off explosives encased in amber within 8 spaces, which explode in a 3x3 area, dealing 7 explosion damage to everyone inside in the process. If the Amber Aquaplane is in the air, it can instead launch 3 2x2 areas that deal 5 damage within 10 horizontal spaces."
weapon,Kyla,"This Is Gonna Hurt, Sorry!",,,"Not wanting to be underestimated, Kyla takes a deep breath and prepares herself for close-quarters combat… gently leaning towards an opponent and lightly flicking them or tapping them with a foot.  This deals 10 damage to them and knocks them backwards 5 spaces.  Anyone adjacent to Kyla when she does this is knocked back 1 space as well, and enemies specifically take 1 damage."
talent,Kyla,"Aw Man, She Left Her Gun In The Laundry Again",,,"For being so competent with safety, why is Shao so disorganized when it comes to leaving her weird gadgets in the washer??  Twice per session, as a bonus action, Kyla can suddenly find a small scientific gadget or device in one of her pockets that somehow found its way in there when she did laundry.  It must be something relatively mundane that Shao would use on the job."
talent,Kyla,"I’ll Make it Up to You, I Promise!",,,"Once per Combat, if Kyla ever knocks out someone, she frantically apologizes for causing such a massive injury (As usual), and frantically pats herself down to see if there’s anything on her she can use to pay for her misdeeds. She ends up pulling out a gift card, a coupon, or just some money, and gently places it in the pocket of the knocked out individual. If the knocked out person would accept this apology, Kyla gains 3 comp with them. If they reject it, Kyla gains 2 stamina as she continues to train herself."
passive,Kyla,Inexplicable Strength,,,"For no reason, Kyla is immensely strong.  She has been banned from the local gym, basketball court, community pool, and three separate Burger Kings.  Kyla hates hurting people though, and has joined this tournament to learn how to better control her strength, not to actually use it to its full capacity.  She feels so bad, in fact, that whenever she deals damage to someone, she damages herself for an amount equal to 50% of the damage she dealt (rounded down).  This damage cannot be reduced, as it is more emotional than anything else.  The damage she deals to herself cannot reduce her Stamina below 1.  If she deals damage to multiple enemies at once, she only takes emotional recoil from the enemy she dealt the highest amount of damage to."
passive,Kyla,Giving It Our Full Effort!,,,"In addition to her usual actions, Kyla has one strength-based action that she can take per round, including out of turn, that must be used explicitly for supporting allies rather than attacking enemies.  This can be anything from tossing an ally to reposition them, stomping on the ground to alter the terrain, or anything else her allies can think of.  Kyla can move up to 4 spaces when she takes this strength action out of turn."
ability,Kyla,W-WHOOAA!!,1!,,"Kyla sees an attack coming towards her and does what any combat expert would do:  panic!  She tries desperately to dodge backwards, arms windmilling through the air, and very likely trips and falls backwards in the process.  This can reduce or negate the damage she takes from an attack, and she can move up to 3 spaces backwards when she dodges.  Any enemies adjacent to her when she hits the ground take 6 damage, and the 3x3 area around herself is broken into difficult terrain from the force of the impact.  She is knocked prone from doing this.  Once per round."
ability,Kyla,"Fuck, I Broke The Sidewalk Again",2,,"Trying to stay light on her feet, Kyla moves up to 1.5x her movement in a straight line, running at a light jog.  All spaces she steps on when she does this are shattered, becoming difficult terrain, and any enemies who are in this line, while Kyla doesn’t actually touch them, still take 7 damage and are knocked aside 3 spaces from the windforce her movements created.  "
ability,Kyla,Punch,3⛯,,"Emotions show clearly on Kyla’s face as she’s temporarily overcome with anger, frustration, or sadness… forgetting her self control for a moment and lunging forward with a punch.  In a 5x12 area directly in front of her, a black and red hurricane of apocalyptic kinetic force ripples through the air as everyone and everything in this area is blasted backwards, either to the end of the 12 space line if they’re in the area’s center line or to the side of the area if they’re to the left or right of it.  Allies in this area take 8 damage and enemies take 25 and are knocked prone.  Objects in the area are destroyed, and all spaces in the area are split apart like a rift, effectively lowering the elevation of it by 10 feet.  Kyla cannot use this ability if she and her allies are not in serious danger; she will never use it in skirmishes and only if the stakes are very high in a data bounty.  If she’s getting riled up or emotional for some reason, she’ll be more likely to use this.  Once per combat.  "
weapon,Ape X,Armed and Dangerous,,,"Ape X has two large ape arms that are hairy, heavy, and very strong. Melee Range, 5 damage. Ape X may attack twice with the weapon in one action. If he manages to hit the same target twice, he may then make a contested roll to knock them prone. When using a Legendary action, he may only attack once."
talent,Ape X,Collateral Damage,,,Ape X has advantage and double damage on destroying items and objects.
talent,Ape X,Ambul-Ape,,,"So long as Ape X is climbing, jumping, or otherwise doing Ape-like Movement, he may move his normal speed and ignore all difficult terrain or slowing effects. Additionally, when he is double moving, he can use his arms to help and gain +1 move (+2 total)"
passive,Ape X,Legend,,,"Ape X is no simple ape, he is spoken of in hushed whispers by those who fear him, and with grand reverence by those who admire him. He is THE ape. Ape X, Legend. Ape X starts every round with 1 Legendary Action. Also, 4 Legendary Resists per session. Legendary Resist: auto-pass a skill check, save, or roll-off against another target. Legendary Action: At the end of someone else's turn, basic attack, move, or Summon an Ape. Range 3. 5 Sta, 2 Dmg, 5 Move. Additionally, as a legendary Ape, there are many rumours about him, some fact, some fiction. Other players in the session may make up a “Legend” about Ape X. If the legend is mechanically irrelevant, it may be accepted or rejected as a true fact about Ape X. If it IS mechanically relevant, then once per combat he may make that legend true for the duration of the combat in exchange for a stamina cost of the GM’s choosing. Also, once per session, you may accept the legend as true FOREVER in exchange for Max Stamina of the GM’s Choosing."
ability,Ape X,Ape Out,3,,"Ape X beats his chest and lets loose, showing his true strength. But for the sake of other apes, he cannot do it for long. While in this state, Ape X is followed by his after image, capable of enhancing any and all actions he takes. Ape X gains +4 movement and may have his after image assist his actions in some way. Upkeep 2."
ability,Ape X,Ape Escape,2!,,"No form of imprisonment can contain Ape X. For he is too strong, and too legendary. But he does not simply escape. He ensures that no one will succumb to that form of imprisonment again. Use as a bonus action without expending a use. Use in response to an incoming attack or ability. Ape X briefly escapes reality, destroying the incoming attack, and then teleporting next to the source of it. As part of the roll, he smacks them for 5 damage and disables the attack or ability that was just destroyed for 1 turn. If used as a bonus action, it targets the last ability used instead but doesn’t negate the past use of it. Once per round."
ability,Ape X,Tool Use,X,,"Ape X summons the resources he is most used to working with in order to create a tool suited to his current needs. Vines, wood, rocks, mud, and more. So long as it’s made of something from the jungle, he can make it. Make some kind of item that you can keep for the rest of combat, or is one time use. One way or another it is very well made. GM decides cost according to the tool made."
weapon,Ferris,What's Up My Sleeves?,,,"Ferris loves surprises and as a result doesn’t have a set weapon. At the start of combat Ferris may roll a d6 twice on the table below and have both those weapons for the combat, choosing which one to use each time she attacks. 1: Pies - 3 range 2 damage. 13+ blinds for 1 round. Use on an adjacent ally or self for 2 heal instead. 2: Croquet Mallet - 2 range 4 damage, half of target’s next movement is in a random direction (round down) 3: Spring Boxing Glove - 5 range, 4 damage, 2 knockback. 4: Hand Buzzer - Melee range, 5 lightning damage. Targets movement halved next round. This has Advantage if Ferris can get a genuine handshake. 5: Juggling Clubs - 3 range, 3 damage. Each turn Ferris juggles these she receives a stacking +2 attack and +1 damage. However, enemies also receive the bonus to hit (not damage). If she is hit, she loses her bonus. 6: Huge Honkin’ Horn - 15ft cone 3 Sonic Damage. Deafen for 1 turn."
talent,Ferris,Bigger Than it Looks,,,"So long as Ferris is the first one in and out of a vehicle or container, then its capacity is tripled. If Ferris is ejected prematurely or forcefully then everyone else is comically thrown out of the vehicle also."
passive,Ferris,Centre Stage *Clown Music*,,,"Ferris naturally draws attention by being a clown but encourages it as she’s a talented performer. It’s difficult not to focus on her as a result. Ferris may have up to a 3 square aura around her. If an ally within this is being targeted by an enemy, they must roll not to target Ferris instead. Additionally, whenever a detrimental attack or ability misses Ferris, she may choose to force it to hit her instead. If she does, treat the roll as if it were a 10. Naturally she’s great at anything clown related as well."
ability,Ferris,Ragdoll,1!,,"Ferris knows how to take a hit, and how to make it look funny! Ferris tumbles end over end as and may convert damage into knockback in a 1:1 ratio. If she hits any terrain she takes 3 damage. She is always prone at the end of this. Once per Round."
ability,Ferris,Party Popper Pandemonium,1!,,"Ferris gets an enemies attention by firing a party popper full of ___. Use as a bonus action without expending a use. Choose a target. The target, their square, and every square between Ferris and them is coated in a substance that could feasibly be fired out of a part popper. Target is then immediately Taunted for the duration of their current action. If their current attack could not target Ferris, they must choose an attack that can. Range 6. Once per Round."
ability,Ferris,Clowning Around,3,,"Ferris is familiar with clown magic and has learnt to control some aspects of it to aid in her performances! Before, or at the start of combat, roll 5 times on the Clown Magic List. Note the results. When Ferris uses this ability, she may pick one of the results and summon an item related to that result within range. Alternatively, she may simply target someone and fire off one of the results. If she has no more results or wants new ones, cast this as a bonus action for the same cost with no other effect other than getting new results. Range 8."
ability,Clowns,Clown Magic,2,,Fire off a burst of Clown Magic! Pick a target and roll on the Clown Magic List.

weapon,Kazimir,Innovate!,,,"3 damage, 5 range energy cannon that can pierce a target for 1 damage."
talent,Kazimir,I’m Just Getting Started!,,,"If there’s one thing Kazimir has, it’s initiative. In fact, he has so much, that at the start of every round his initiative goes up by one! 29: Heat Sync - As combat goes on, Kazimir’s production produces more excess steam and heat, and it’s all gotta go somewhere! In addition to his bonuses to initiative, Kazimir gains +1 damage to his physical attacks for each round of combat that has passed."
passive,Kazimir,One Man Industrial Revolution,,,"When Kazimir moves, he can choose what he builds this turn: Conveyor belts: Every space he moves, a conveyor belt that moves in the path he moved (1 space per turn) is placed everywhere behind him. Factory Block (Manufacture) - Kazimir selects an object for the ”Factory block” to create, which it does every turn. He may place it adjacent to him at the beginning or end of a movement. Factory Block (Refine) - If placed upon a factory block, the thing the Factory block makes is upgraded. Twice per Combat, he may do two effects instead of one for 3 stamina. 18: Instaspeed Belt - Kazimir gains a new conveyor belt type! Whenever he places one, he can replace it with this kind! Instaspeed - A target on an instaspeed conveyor belt is immediately flung at least 6 spaces in the direction it is pointing upon touching it. A target may choose to travel even farther when they hit it if they want, with no practical limit on travel distance."
ability,Kazimir,"Harder, Better, Faster.",0!,,Kazimir augments a (non living) thing adjacent to or on him attempting to modify it a certain way. (Example - Augment his cannon to have a chance to stun on high rolls.) This ability can also be used to attempt to repair something. Once per round. Augment slots can only be taken up by effects of Harder Better Faster. The cost becomes X-1 if he’s on a conveyor belt
ability,Kazimir,Can't Stop Progress,3,,"Kazimir activates the jets on Progress, dashing 25 ft in any direction. He leaves a track of conveyor belts along his path, which go 1 space per turn. The belts remain until destroyed or combat ends. If this ability hits an enemy, they are knocked back 10ft, take 9 damage, and Kazimir takes the place the target had. The conveyor belts stop one space behind where he stands. "
ability,Kazimir,Assembly Line,3,,"Kazimir raises Progress to the sky as throughout the field, the conveyor belts speed up radically. He may place 12 additional tiles of conveyor belt throughout the field, and all objects and people end up at the end of the conveyor belt line. Kazimir also creates a circle of conveyor belts around him and VIOLENTLY smashes into the earth below him, dealing 5 damage in a shockwave around him. He may use this multiple times per combat, but can only place down 12 tiles of conveyor belt once."
ability,Kazimir,Merger Block,1,,"Using this, Kazimir can create a block similar to a foundry block. However, this block actually accepts two different conveyor belts as intake. Once two items go into it, it will spit out a combined item that is more potent and powerful!"
ability,Kazimir,Speed Up Production,1!,,"All current conveyor belts and foundry blocks suddenly speed up, immediately causing them to move three times. This can be used to speed up your assembly, or they can just throw people around to avoid things! Once per round."
weapon,Venus,The Furnace,,,"The now upgraded cannon, made of solid iron with a folding rifle shield-like piece on the front. Hurts about as much as you'd expect getting hit by cannon hurting for. Despite it being made of solid iron and being massive, Venus wields the Furnace like it’s nothing. 8 Damage 1 Range. (Prof 65) Venus can set The Furnace down on the ground as a bonus action. She loses it as a weapon, but she gains +1 movement while doing so. Tumble can fire as an anytime once per round, but only in the exact path Venus set it in when she dropped it. Tumble doesn’t gain any new traits from Adapt & Improvise until Venus touches it again, but it does keep all current augments it has. Once per session."
weapon,Venus,The Furnace - Ranged Fire,,,"Ever wanna deal damage, but not at a melee range? Well this is still a cannon, despite what Venus has lead you to believe! She may use it as a baseball bat half the time, but that doesn't mean she can't fire the thing! 5 Damage 5 Range."
weapon,Venus,The Furnace - Flamethrower Mode,,,"The big ol' grate on the front showing burning coals isn't just for show y'know! With a few switches and such, Venus puts The Furnace into a flamethrower mode. This functions like a blowtorch if used in melee, or like a massive pillar of flames if used at range on some poor unsuspecting opponent. 4 Damage 4 Range."
weapon,Venus,The Furnace - Scrap Shot Mode,,,"Venus takes an object, opens the door and shoves it into her cannon to be fired out as a ""Custom Projectile."" Its effects, damage, and range all vary. It can also heat up whatever projectile may be fired, if so desired. It also has an extra damage due to an upgrade!"
weapon,Venus,These Two Fists,,,"Or some other cool as fuck name. That doesn't change the fact they're still Venus' fists, and she hits like a goddamn *truck.*"
weapon,Venus,Ishtar - Small Arms Manufacturing,,,"The retractable cannon in Venus' left gauntlet (named Ishtar). It can be fired as a free action 2-3 times per combat, be it to punctuate an action, lay down covering fire, what have you! 4 Damage 1 Range."
weapon,Venus,Aphrodite - Star Crossed Lovers.,,,"A retractable grappling hook in Venus' right gauntlet (named Aphrodite). It can be fired as a free action to attach herself to something. The other end can be fired at another thing, and they can optionally be pulled together with decent force whenever Venus desires. The hooks are far more than sturdy enough to hold Venus' weight and more. 0 Damage 8 Range."
talent,Venus,Tenacity,,,"Venus can’t be slowed, and it’s harder for her movement action to be taken away."
passive,Venus,Stronghold Armor,,,"Venus’ Stronghold Armour gives her various abilities, such as; increased strength and not being weighed down by anything attached to her armour. Venus counts as cover for any ally standing behind her. She also gets a flat one damage reduction against all physical damage."
passive,Venus,Armor Class,,,"Venus starts each match with a 7 red stat. Any roll to attack her is completely negated by her armor if it rolls equal to her armor class or less (since ties go to defender). Attacks can still miss if they roll higher, if the GM deems they should, however attacks that roll lower do not work. Every time Venus uses Adapt & Improvise, her armor class goes up by 1. Her armor class caps at 16. With a good enough hit or something flavorful, her armour class may be reduced. 79: Venus’ max Armor Class is now 16."
passive,Venus,Hydraulic Strength,,,Venus can move with unspeakable strength! This lets her automatically succeed strength checks (as long as it’s still something physically possible and feasible under anime strength). She also gets a +1 damage to all of her attacks.
ability,Venus,Venusian Soldiers,1!,,"Venus sends out two 2’0 tall steel humanoid soldiers from two hatches in her armour. The soldiers have weak rifles and a bit of strength, though they are well trained in working, rewiring technology, and building. (28) Venusian Soldiers can use a smaller scale version of Adapt & Improvise. Venus spends the stamina for them however, so she needs to be wary of burning out. It also takes up their action."
ability,Venus,Adapt & Improvise,2,,"Venus incorporates an object adjacent to her into her Stronghold Armour, giving her a buff related to the attachment. 41: Things incorporated into Venus’ armor also effects Tumble’s damage and might add bonus effect."
ability,Venus,Improv Siege Weapon,2,,"Venus uses her epithet to modify an adjacent object into a sort of siege weapon. 33: Composite Siege Weapon - Venus can also choose to combine two adjacent objects and transform them into a single Siege Weapon with traits from both. This costs an additional stamina, but the results are more powerful. (14) Trigger Happy Havoc - Upon making a siege weapon, Venus may roll to fire it the turn it is built, however it's just a hint weaker (except on exceptionally high rolls.) "
ability,Venus,Bolster Defences!,2,,"Venus takes an object or material she can touch, and stretches it into a massive wall / barricade! It stops people from moving between the wall. Venus also denotes one side to be the “inside”, and anyone on that side can attack through the wall if they have enough range while protected from retaliation. The wall also gains properties of whatever object it was created from. 54: When using Bolster Defenses on an object, you can choose to have it expand 4 spaces to one side, or grow 2 spaces on both sides to become two sizes bigger! 73: War of Attrition - Walls created with Bolster Defences can now attempt to use Adapt & Improvise on anything that touches them including attacks, causing the walls to increase further in size and gain passive traits as well as potential weaponry added onto them. Venus must still pay the stamina cost and roll for this. If Venus uses Adapt & Improvise on a Bolster Defences wall she gets armor class equal to 1 + an additional 1 for each thing the wall has incorporated itself."
ability,Venus,So That's Why We Put it Away...,2,,"Venus names a weapon, and reaches into her chest piece to try to bring it out. Then, roll 3 pairs of adjectives. Only one set of adjectives can be chosen. These adjectives are then applied to the weapon. Free action, Once per combat. 48: So That’s Why We Put It Away now rolls six pairs of adjectives. She still picks one pair out of them."
ability,Venus,Impromptu Incorporation,2!,,"As an attack is coming towards her, Venus can resonate with her armor in such a way that it absorbs the incoming attack, negating it. She can then choose to spend two extra stamina to either cause the effect of “Adapt & Improvise”, “Improv Siege Weapon”, or “Bolster Defenses” to trigger on the attack hit immediately. This works even on non-physical or energy based attacks as well, turning them into an item or effect relating to them. Once per round."
weapon,Vaskeri,Retrieve Arms From Magic Chest,,,"A certain weapon Vaskeri made which takes two very different forms, and switches every time it’s referred to (but not switching on Vaskeri’s turn, no abusing!) The two versions of Vaskeri (if applicable) have opposite weapons. Red Shortblade - A simple enough sword held backwards. When used, Vaskeri dashes 3 spaces and makes a simple cut across everyone through the line, dealing 4 damage. Vaskeri must dash. Onyx Cane - An extendable black cane that’s half wood and half steel. 2 range, 5 damage (1 of which counts as electric). It makes me look like a distinguished gentleman! :D"
passive,Vaskeri,Touch of Technology,,,Vaskeri’s left hand makes non-technological things it touches into technology after sustained touch. He can also undo the technology metamorphosis that he does.

Vaskeri’s Touch of Technology passive can heal for small amounts.
ability,Vaskeri,Pick A God And Pray! Haha!,3⛯,,"With a wave of Vaskeri’s hand, a piece of technology within 10 spaces comes to life under Vaskeri’s command. This creature can always act on its first turn of life, though depending on the roll it may be less effective. Once per Combat."

ability,Vaskeri,Bluescreen ,2!,,"Vaskeri takes control of a piece of technology and attempts to use it in some fashion, such as shorting out, blowing up, firing when it’s not supposed to, that kind of thing. The definition of technology is very loose. Either Vaskeri can be affected by this."
ability,Vaskeri,Pick A God And Pray.,3,,All spaces within 4 spaces of Vaskeri are consumed with a flurry of slashes. This deals 6 damage to everyone in that area. Vaskeri may continue the aura at half damage for 2 upkeep and -1 movement.
ability,Vaskeri,Overclock,X,,"Vaskeri touches an adjacent target and overcharges them, making an ability they have twice as powerful, but it has repercussions. The cost of Overclock is the cost of the targeted ability."
ability,Vaskeri,Overcharge,XX,,"Vaskeri selects an ability of an ally or enemy that was successfully used, then uses a somewhat upgraded version of that ability (can’t target OPC’s and above effects). Obviously if it’s a super powerful boss attack or has unique mechanics attached, this version may have repercussions, cost more, etc. Be as merciless as you want with the costs of using this ability. Only Corrupted Vaskeri takes the cost for using this ability."

ability,Valeria,Infinity Reflected,2!,,"Valeria teleports a copy of an attack or ability into a portal. She can summon the attack/ability and use it as a main action. She can use the same attack as many times as she wants, however can only have two actions saved. Once per round."
ability,Valeria,Let's Stack the Odds,2!,,"Valeria summons a clone of herself to do a simple task, such as attacking or assisting someone with something. These Valeria’s always carry small seemingly irrelevant items. Valeria can use this ability to summon certain clones with no other purpose than to have objects. Once per Combat, the clone can use an ability that Valeria has. Twice per round."
ability,Valeria,More Fitting as to The Situation,3,,"Valeria summons a portal and enters it. A short while later, a copy of Valeria comes through another portal with a major difference.This can be anything from having a gun or a car to having a stand or being a large, corrupted version of herself. She is also cleansed of all major debuffs. More Fitting To The Situation’s portal lingers for a bit, causing the events happening in that reality to spill over in any way Valeria wants. Twice per combat. "
ability,Valeria,Now You’re Thinking With Portals,3⛯,,Valeria can create two linked portals that allow people and objects to freely flow between them. She can spend a free action once per turn to move the position of one of the portals. Once per combat.
ability,Valeria,And Goodbye!,3⛯,,"Valeria V warps someone to some apocalyptic dimension. At the start of what would be their next turn, they must make a saving throw against Valeria’s roll for this ability. If they succeed, they return having taken 5 damage. Otherwise, they take 5 + the number of turns they were gone in damage due to the horrifying conditions of that place they went to. On especially bad saving throws they can even have some kind of negative change on them. Tie goes to defender. Once per combat."
ability,Valeria,Special Valeriabilities,3,,"Valeria has a powerful signature technique she only uses in dire circumstances. There’s just one problem: there are so different Valeria’s with different techniques! Only clones created by This Calls For A Celebration or The World Ends With Me can use this ability, but they can make up an ability related to where they came from. No signature moves can be used more than once ever. Once per clone."
weapon,Voia,"I’m A Sick Crunch, I Like The Big Munch",,,"With her razor-sharp teeth, Voia viciously tears into the most delicious-looking thing nearby, dealing 6 damage at 1 range.  With her incredible strength, she can spend 1 Stamina to also forcibly reposition targets she damages with this attack that are 3x3 spaces in size or smaller, slamming them into the ground in a space adjacent to her for an additional 2 damage, knocking them prone in the process.  She can spend this 1 Stamina more than once per attack."
weapon,Voia,Black Gate Blade,,,"A sword given to her by her mother, a purely black blade with arcs of odd light across its surface. It deals 9 damage at 2 range, and deals 4 recoil damage to her when used.  Bonus action.  Once per Combat."
talent,Voia,A Hopeful Ruler,,,"As a powerful demoness who wants to be the strongest of all, whenever Voia wishes, she may become aware of the strongest individual Proficiency-wise (or the nearest equivalent) who is within her line of sight or hearing distance.  She has a +2 bonus to all rolls she makes against this individual.  If she herself is the strongest individual within sight or hearing distance, she has a +2 bonus to all rolls she makes in general, and also has +1 damage to all attacks."
passive,Voia,Shadow Of Greatness,,,"In a family as strong as the Vanderbelts, Voia has a lot to measure up to.  Luckily for her, she’s the strongest of them all!  With her infinite powers of darkness, Voia has the ability to imitate the powers of her family members and close allies, with her own sinister twist.  At the start of each combat, Voia can choose two ‘Shadow Arts’ from her list to utilize for the duration of that combat.  Each Shadow Art is a once per combat special ability based on one of her family members, or someone who has left a significant impression on her in a previous adventure.  At the end of each session she’s in, she can choose someone who left a significant impression on her and then choose one ability of theirs that she saw them use, and then create a new Shadow Art based on that ability.  Shadow Arts have the same basic functionality as the original ability, but take on a shadowy aesthetic and mechanics that suit Voia’s fighting style.  All Shadow Arts start off relatively weak compared to regular abilities.  However, Voia can funnel Proficiency into them if she wishes.  When a Shadow Art reaches its maximum of 10 Proficiency, it transforms, becoming as powerful as a fully-fledged ability. Shadow Arts: Cynthia: Spacetime Eradication (4) - A shadowy manifestation of Cynthia appears before holding out a hand. Targeting a 5x5 area somewhere on the field, with a few swift movements of her hands suddenly creates claws everywhere around the area as everything and everyone in the area is crushed before being brought to Voia. Damage varies, but hovers around 10. Hope: Voracity (5) - For a moment, Voia enters her Shadow Stalker form and dives into the ground, making a 7x7 pool of stygian stomach acid, before suddenly from the pool bursts an uncountable number of teeth as Voia starts to feast upon whatever is in the area, potentially eating and shredding items and completely consuming mooks and summons. Elixyveth: Soul Sovereign (5) - A shadowy effect of Elixyveth appears, holding out a scythe of shadowy-death-and-life-y-energy-y. She swipes it up dramatically, dealing 13 damage in a 5 space line. If this kills anyone, shadows immediately possess their body, and they’re reduced to Voia’s minions!... Once per Combat. Vivian: Fool’s Mate (0) - Vivian is all about playing the long game with a smile. Keeping herself in control, welcoming challenge so she can crush it under foot. This ability does nothing by itself, but if Voia stores it as a shadow action it is instead a 3x3 that deals 1.5x damage. When activated, a large Rook appears and acts on Voia’s turn. It can act, but not move. Demonic Infusion - Each time Voia successfully uses a Shadow Art on her turn, she may choose to gain one extra Frenzy point when her turn ends."
passive,Voia,Apex Predator,,,"Voia’s done time. Time in the shadow realm, that is. 3,000 years of it!  And while in the shadow realm, she can take on her most powerful form of all, her Shadow Stalker form.  While in this form, Voia’s capabilities are strengthened in the following ways: Voia’s current and maximum Stamina are increased by 50%, rounded up. All damage Voia deals is increased by 3-4. Shadow Puppetry becomes twice per round. Voia’s schworms have 5 Stamina and deal 3 damage each.  At the start of her turn, three schworms are summoned in spaces of her choice within 4 spaces of her. Burrow Beneath now rolls with advantage. Several of Voia’s abilities allow her to gain Frenzy stacks. Frenzy stacks increase her rolls and damage by 1 per stack.  However, each time she makes a roll while not in Shadow Stalker form, she loses a stack.  When she gains a Frenzy stack, she can choose to ‘store’ it, so that it isn’t lost if she makes a roll, but she also gains no effect from it.  If she stores 12 Frenzy stacks in this way, then once per session, she can transform into her Shadow Stalker form even while not in the shadow realm as an unrolled bonus action.  However, she also takes 10% of her maximum Stamina as true damage at the start of each of her turns while transformed, and can only transform back upon being knocked unconscious or when the combat ends.  If she is in direct sunlight, she takes 20% of her maximum Stamina as true damage instead. Voia may freely do this out of combat. Being IN combat and properly maintaining her form AND fighting is a whole buncha’ stuff at the same time."
passive,Voia,Shadow Possession,,,"Voia can freely hop into people's shadows, being a Shadowrealm entity and all. While within someone’s shadow, she can roll to possess them from within, wreaking whatever havoc she desires! She can make them take actions while under her control, though she usually has to pay Stamina cost to do so. She can also go flat against objects and phase through stuff.  Once per session, while inside someone’s shadow, she can gain a free Shadow Art based on them if she spends 5 Stamina and successfully possesses them."
passive,Voia,Lordess Of Darknessess!,,,"Voia has come a long way since her first adventure with DBA, going from a small shadowy baby to a much more powerful and mature small shadowy baby. No longer is she bound by family ties or villainous obligations.  Whether she decides to wreak havoc on the masses, or be a hero to the one who matters most - she’ll always be Voia *hecking* Vanderbelt. All Shadow Arts that required main actions are now bonus actions to use, and Voia can now choose four to utilize during each combat rather than two. She also no longer needs to slot in Hope’s Shadow Art; she always has access to it. In addition, by spending 2 extra Stamina when using any of her attacks, abilities, or Shadow Arts (except the Black Gate Blade), Voia can now use them as shadow actions rather than their usual action type.  When something is used as a shadow action, she does not have to roll, and it doesn’t activate immediately.  Rather, a 2x2 space dark vortex is created within 8 spaces of her that lasts until the end of combat.  At any point after her next turn begins, she can activate the vortex, at which point it uses the shadow action stored within it at 1.5x effectiveness.  She must roll for this, but if the roll is a failure, the vortex does not dissipate (though she can’t activate it again for one round).  She may activate multiple vortexes at once with only a single roll, but if she does so, the actions will all be at roughly half effectiveness instead.  If an enemy touches or passes through a vortex, they take 4 shadow damage.  Voia can also possess these vortexes, and if she does so, she can move it up to her normal movement speed on her turn.  If she is possessing one while it isn’t her turn, she can move it one additional space per turn.  While possessing the vortex, it can be damaged, and the damage is transferred to her.  Voia can set one shadow action per turn at base, but can set additional shadow actions per turn equal to the number of times she’s used Shadow Arts successfully during this combat. She can also combine three or more shadow vortexes together by moving them into overlapping spaces.  If she does so, a dark construct of herself is summoned until the end of her next turn, which has all of her capabilities, but only 5+X Stamina with which to use them.  X is equal to the number of additional vortexes used in its creation beyond the first three.  When the construct dies or fades, four schworms are created from its residue."
passive,Voia,I Gotta Have A Good Meal,,,"If there’s one thing Voia does, it’s eat. And she eats a lot. Every turn as a free action, she can consume something, gaining variable amounts of health, a buff depending on what’s consumed, and filling her endless void of a stomach. Not only can she spit out things she’s consumed at any point for potentially assisting in attacks (though she can’t eat them again for health, she’s already tasted them before so that makes ‘em far less cool), but if she’s in her Shadow Stalker form, she can eat things far larger than if she were just a normal person. Furthermore, if she’s in her shadow stalker form, she can freely eat mooks and summons. Nerds, that’s what they get for being small."
ability,Voia,Shadow Puppetry,1!,,"With her dark powers, Voia bends the shadows of a target within 6 spaces of herself, manipulating it however she sees fit.  If she chooses to deal damage with it, it generally deals 3-5 shadow damage.  It can potentially interrupt actions or forcibly move targets on good rolls."
ability,Voia,"Feast, My Bretheren!",2,,"Every Apex Predator has their hordes of ravenous minions!  That’s how the jungle works, dumbass!  Voia calls forth from the void four powerful SHADOW WORMS, each with 3 Stamina, 5 movement, and a 2 damage basic attack.  The schworms can also potentially intercept hits for Voia and her allies if they’re close enough, though they will always die in the process if they are successful, and each schworm can only do so once per round.  Each time a schworm deals damage to an enemy, Voia gains a stack of ‘Frenzy’.  This ability can be used as a bonus action if Voia pays 2 extra Stamina."
ability,Voia,Burrow Beneath,3!,,"With her large horns and powerful claws, Voia rapidly burrows into the earth, potentially avoiding an incoming attack if successful.  Then, while underground, she slithers through the shadows at a terrifying speed.  For each turn that passes, she can move 3 spaces while still underground.  When her next turn begins, she suddenly erupts from the earth, dealing 6 damage to all targets within 1 space of her and knocking them back 2-3 spaces.  If she deals damage to at least two targets in this way, she gains a Frenzy stack.  Voia cannot take any actions while underground (except for Abyssal Grasp).  She can emerge early if she wishes, but she will deal no damage or knockback and cannot emerge in an occupied space.  If she rolled a 14+ with this ability, two schworms also emerge from the earth with her."
ability,Voia,Hunter of the Dark,3,,"Voia extends her hands to either side, eyes flickering with purple flame, and spectral claws made of solid darkness appear around each of her hands, glimmering in the eldritch moonlight.  Up to three times, Voia can shadow-dash to targets within 5 spaces of each other and viciously slash them with her claws and teeth, dealing 7 damage to each target.  Each target must be casting a shadow she can dash to, otherwise she must use her movement to get to them.  She can move-act-move with this ability.  She can also dash additional times beyond the first three if she spends 1 Frenzy stack per additional dash.  She can damage the same target multiple times with this ability on a given turn, but not twice in a row.  She can use a shadow-dash without damaging the target if she wishes.  When Voia’s turn ends after using this ability, she gains Frenzy stacks equal to the number of times she dealt damage with it."
ability,Voia,Abyssal Grasp,1,,"An enormous clawed hand of pure darkness emerges from the ground and grasps itself around a 2x2 area that Voia can see, dealing 4 damage to everyone inside it and heavily restraining them.  Voia can use this ability in the middle of using other abilities without interrupting those abilities, even if it isn’t her turn.  If she spends 2 extra Stamina or 1 Frenzy stack, she can re-roll this ability up to twice per turn.  If she uses this on a shadow vortex created with her passive, she can pick up the vortex and throw it somewhere else in the arena."
weapon,Stella,Big Dipper,,,"A large semicircle knife. Deals 3 damage at 1 range. If used as a main action, you can use Little Dipper as a bonus action this turn."
weapon,Stella,Little Dipper,,,"A karambit knife. Deals 3 damage at 1 range. If used as a main action, you can use Big Dipper as a bonus action this turn. 22: +1 damage."
weapon,Stella,Star Command,,,"Stella points at an enemy, as a star of her choice travels up to 6 spaces from its location and deals half its damage to the target it hits."
talent,Stella,Gemini Sign,,,"At the start of combat Stella creates a constellation outline version of herself. She acts like an additional Stella that can perform the same actions and abilities, but she cannot take damage or really be affected by anything physically. She also deals halved damage to enemies, although this doesn’t affect stars she creates. The primary Stella must pay any stamina costs of her actions. Enemies can pass through her (although not end their turns on her). Lastly, Stella can use the switch teleport of her passive to swap with her copy instead of a star if she so pleases."
talent,Stella,31 Upgrade that gives +1 Movement,,,: +1 movement.
passive,Stella,Starfield Oasis,,,"Whenever Stella successfully performs a main or anytime action, she may pay 1 additional stamina and roll to try and create a star! This star takes up a single space and can be placed anywhere adjacent to her. Stella can also, as a bonus action, switch teleport herself with any star she’s placed on the arena. If an enemy touches a star, they take 6 damage and the star is destroyed. Otherwise, stars don’t take damage and attacks simply phase through them. Stars each have 1 movement on your turn."
passive,Stella,Twilight Point,,,"While in the air, Stella can at any time drop straight down at near instant speeds, taking no fall damage upon touching the ground. This does not require a roll, unless it’s being used to dodge an attack."
passive,Stella,Aquarius Acrobatics,,,"Stella can run up walls, make small jumps, and do acrobatic maneuvers without a roll or adding difficulty to actions she performs. In fact, she can run up a wall regardless of height as small stars appear when her feet touch the wall, giving her more friction than usually possible."
ability,Stella,"""Gotcha~""",1,,"With this Stella grabs a target, performs a quick cut on them, and tosses them up to 3 spaces away. This deals 3 damage and, more importantly, increases the critical hit range against them by +3 until they’re next critted by an attack. This attack also bypasses passive protection, and it cannot be blocked or parried, only dodged. If this rolled a 14+, you can perform another action immediately."
ability,Stella,X Divide,2,,"Putting the Big and Little Dippers in a cross pattern, Stella performs a cross slash down through the enemy. This deals 6 damage to them, can move up to 3 spaces, and more importantly marks them with an Exposed status. The next time they are hit by an attack this round, the attacker can immediately take another action and the Exposed status is removed. 18: The Exposed status now also makes the target suffer disadvantage when attacking Ryne."
ability,Stella,Super Nova,3!,,"Stella closes her hands, as a star on the field explodes dealing its damage in a 3x3. If an enemy hit like this is within range of an attacking action of Stella’s she can immediately attack them. Once per round."
ability,Stella,Virgo Sweep ,2,,"A blade made of constellation stars forms around her, performing a quick sweep. This deals 4 damage at 1 range to all targets in a 180 degree sweep in front of her. If a star is hit this way, she may immediately detonate it."
ability,Stella,Infinite Tapestry,3⛯,,"Stella vanishes with extreme speed, holding both knives close to her body. She goes directly towards a star of her choice, and from there towards another, and another, and so on until she’s traveled to each star of the field. She can’t jump to the same star multiple times. For each dash, she deals damage to everyone she passes by. The first time she dashes through someone, they take 7 damage, and each other dash deals 3 damage. Afterwards, she can use the pattern drawn from her movement to create an effect based on the “constellation” drawn by this formation. Once per combat."
weapon,Arlya,Fragment,,,A massive transparent shard of… something. It seems to have an epithet-like aura and glows a faint maroon color. Arlya can summon it at any time. Deals 6 damage at 2 range.
passive,Arlya,Arcane Aspect,,,"As a being comprised of residual epithet energy, she absorbs some of the energy she gets hit with. Whenever hit with an epithet-based effect you gain a choice of either +1 movement, +1 damage, or +1 to your rolls. These last for the rest of combat. In addition to the current potential effects of your passive, you gain “heal 2 stamina” to the list. 24: Epithet Aspect - When Arlya learns an enemy epithet, she gains two triggers of her passive immediately. If this happens outside of combat, it will trigger in the very next combat. 51: Echoes of Death - Much like the entity before Arlya, it seems that one struggles to rid her power from this world. Combining the use of her epithet alongside her developing reaper techniques to bend souls, upon going to 0 or less stamina Arlya may choose to expend all of her active bonuses from her passive to heal for 1 stamina each. This can only trigger once per combat. 57: Your passive has a new option! Upon triggering, you may choose an ability and decrease its stamina cost by 1 for the rest of combat. And yes, this CAN bring an ability’s cost to below 0, making it heal her upon attempting it. 72: Greater Charge - When being hit by a class 2 epithet effect, Arlya gains two activations of her passive instead of one. When hit by a class 3 epithet effect, she gains 3. Shardless Seraph - So long as Arlya has gained five charges this combat, then she gains the ability to move-act-move, and use her basic attack as a bonus action. She also immediately regains 10 stamina which can overheal upon reaching this milestone for the first time this combat."
passive,Arlya,Epithet Refraction,,,"Whenever Arlya successfully performs an action, she may pay 1 additional stamina and roll a single epithet word. She may then attempt a second action once per round based off of that one word."
passive,Arlya,Wings of Redemption,,,"As a movement action, Arlya may roll three random epithet words and choose one. That word solidifies into energy, forming a glass-like wing floating from her body behind her. For the rest of combat, Arlya may either perform actions related to that word independent of any abilities, or she may add properties of that word to her weapon attacks. She may only have two words active like this at once, she cannot replace one wing with a newly rolled one if she prefers the new word, and they go away at the end of combat. On the plus side, once Arlya has two she can fly!"
passive,Arlya,Lord of Lonely Souls,,,"Arlya controls the domain of lonely souls, those in isolation or from empty pasts. As such, when fighting a singular enemy all her attacks deal +2 damage and passes through DR."
passive,Arlya,Separated From The Whole,,,"Once per combat, Arlya can touch an adjacent person during her turn and metaphysically isolate them from others. This makes them unable to receive positive benefits from any external force for a round. This does not require a roll or an action."
ability,Arlya,Power Scavenger,X-1,,"When people use their epithets, there is inevitably some energy that’s left behind. Before it dissipates, you can take and harness such energy. Use an epithet-based ability that was used within the past round. The ability might be a little bit weaker than normal. Stamina cost is the same as that ability minus 1."
ability,Arlya,Innate Draw,3,,"Arlya can call upon the previous energy she was born from. Roll three words and pick one. Perform an ability based off of that epithet. You don’t get to keep this ability, you have to roll again next time you use this. (21): Upon using Innate Draw, Arlya can choose one of the epithet words that she isn’t using for the actual ability’s effects. The next time Innate Draw is used, she can choose that word as if it were a part of the list, or alternatively bank it again to use even later."
ability,Arlya,Shatter Shell,0!,,"Cause an attack to kind of pass through you, shattering your form before it reforms afterwards, reducing the incoming attack’s damage to 1 or 2, based on how well you roll."
ability,Arlya,String Puller,1!,,"You can detect and grab the invisible leylines of the universe, allowing you to spatially shift reality up to 4 spaces. You can interpret the specifics of that. Once per Round."
ability,Arlya,Mirror Killer,1,,"With this ability, Arlya’s form seemingly splits into two as she dashes up to three spaces towards two different targets. One of these is a fake shard copy, which deals 1 damage and shatters after attacking. The more tangible one deals 3 damage. Upon being used successfully, you may pay the cost of this ability again to attempt to use it again, but with the shard agent inflicting a status effect or buff that the other shard agent hit target was affected with. This only triggers once per round."
ability,Arlya,Record Scratch on a Frosted Window,3,,"Arlya swipes her shard, and in that area crystalline cracks form in the air. This allows her to define any line between any two points, so long as both points are within her line of sight. If any enemies are on this line, they immediately take her basic attack damage and the line disappears. However if there aren’t, then the line stays. Whenever an enemy passes over the line, they take Arlya’s basic attack damage AND get knocked prone AND she can immediately teleport to be adjacent to the enemy, although the line still disappears. Finally, whenever a line activates Arlya gains a single activation of her passive for each epithet user hit. Recharge 5-6."
ability,Arlya,Piece of the Puzzle,3,,"Arlya must have two wings in order to use this, and doing so causes both wings to shatter. However, in return time temporarily stutters. This isn’t perceivable or interruptible even by the usual time characters. During this time, Arlya may switch teleport any number of targets on the battlefield. She may also move to any location on the battlefield. Immediately afterwards, she can take a basic attack which cannot be anytimed and is guaranteed to hit, causing time to resume upon landing."
weapon,Captain Omega,Electro-Gauntlets,,,"Two incredibly shiny, metal, orange gauntlets featuring elaborate designs unnecessary for punching things. Much of the material had the bodily organs of electric eels melded into it, allow for Captain Omega to electrically charge her fists. If desired, she can also create Eel Whips that fire out from the palms of the gauntlets. 5 damage as a melee weapon, while the whips deal 4 damage and can reach up to 2 spaces away. Particularly high rolls using the eel whips can allow Omega to paralyze hit targets."
talent,Captain Omega,You Dare Defy Me?,,,"Captain Omega will not stand for anyone attempting to counter her attacks. As such, if someone counters her, she can immediately counter back."
passive,Captain Omega,Techno Turbine 3007,,,"The core of Captain Omega’s armor is known as the Techno-Turbine 3007, which is a vast improvement over the Techno-Turbine 3006. With this mechanical marvel, Captain Omega can absorb any piece of technology, or anything else made of metal, directly into her armor. When she does this, she can either mold the absorbed item into her armor, giving her a property based off of it, or she can create a temporary ability based off the item. If she desires, she can also store items for later, even fusing multiple together at once. 34. POWER-UP!! - The Techno Turbine 3006’s getting an upgrade! +1 Movement."
ability,Captain Omega,Omega Yeet,3!,,"Captain Omega’s signature technique: a jet-boosted dash towards a target, followed by a grapple, and then an incredibly powerful downwards throw. When activating this ability, Omega can zoom up to 5 spaces in ANY direction, and if she manages to grab someone, she can perform one of two variations of this move. The first variation has Captain Omega stay on the ground, immediately slamming a grabbed opponent downward and causing them to get temporarily stuck/buried. The second variation has her take her target high into to the sky, and after a fair amount of exaggerated wind-up, send them speeding back down like a meteor. With this variation, it does not bury them, but she can throw the target down to any spot she can she. No matter which variation she uses, she always shouts a bellowing “OMEGA YEET!!” right before she tosses her victim. Once per round. 27. Heavy Hammer - Captain Omega gains a new variation of Omega Yeet! Similar to the variation where she meteors someone down into the dirt, she takes her victim into the skies before slamming them down. However, this time...she’s going with them. This becomes a soaring slam that has both of them go zooming into the ground. This deals a fair bit more damage than the usual Omega Yeet (somewhere around 15 stamina worth), but it also does around half damage recoil to Omega."
ability,Captain Omega,Hidden Missiles,X!,,"Captain Omega lets out a boisterous laugh before revealing an absurd amount of missile launchers hidden within her armor. For each stamina she uses on this ability, 2 heat-seeking missiles begin following targets of her choice. The missiles can move 6 spaces per turn, and Captain Omega can direct them so long as they are constantly heading towards their intended target. Once per round."
ability,Captain Omega,Do You Think a Barrier Will Work?,1!,,"With a cocky taunt of asking the question this ability is named after, Captain Omega releases a energy barrier that encompasses her and all adjacent spaces to her. While typically used to nullify or even reflect attacks, it can deal up to 4 damage, and if this barrier does work as a way to knock someone out, Captain Omega gains +2 to her base attack and movement, as well as a fair amount of satisfaction over the fact that her defense technique managed to finish someone off. Ha, the weakling never stood a chance. Once per round. 24. Don’t Go Dying On Me Yet - Do You Think A Barrier Will Work? can now be used on allies within 3 spaces of Captain Omega, but doing so makes the ability cost 2 stamina, and knocking someone out with it only grants +1 to her basic attack damage and her movement."
ability,Captain Omega,Hostile Takeover,2,,"Captain Omega pulls out a large flagpole seemingly out of nowhere, with a sharp point at its end and the flag featuring the symbol of her company: which is a picture of her helmet shaded with harsh blacks on its right side and a shining moon in the background. This can not only be used to stab people, but Omega can also place it on something or someone to claim it as hers. Anyone in Omega’s Party that is standing within a 2x2 area around the flag gains a +2 attack boost. Omega can simply carry this along with her as well, giving her allies the boost if they stand within two spaces of her, but she does not gain the bonus herself this way. 31. Banner of War - If Captain Omega Omega Yeets the flag produced from Hostile Takeover, its effects are heightened, giving an extra +1 to its attack boost. This extra boost can only be stacked 2 times per flag."
ability,Captain Omega,THRUSTERS ACTIVATE,1,,"Omega fires out jet thrusters from her armor, which attach to something within 6 range. Omega can then freely activate and deactivate the jets to cause whatever object they're attached to to boost at HIGH SPEEDS in a said direction. You can turn them on or off as a once per round anytime."
weapon,Calista,Regal Longsword,,,A longsword adorned with gold paint and complicated designs: just how Calista likes it. 5 damage as a melee weapon.
weapon,Calista,Knight's Blade,,,The sword that Calista’s Epithet possesses while in Knight Forme. Deals 5 damage as a melee weapon.
weapon,Calista,Cavalier's Spear,,,The spear that Calista’s Epithet produces for her while in Cavalier Forme. Deals 4 damage and has 2 range.
talent,Calista,Art of War,,,"Due to Calista’s vast knowledge regarding combat strategy, she is far more proficient at determining what an enemy’s battle plan is at a glance. Therefore, on any rolls in which she is trying to identify enemies, their plans, their stamina, etc, she rolls with advantage."
passive,Calista,The Queen and All The Queen’s Men,,,"Calista’s Epithet manifests in the form of a spectral set of armor that typically floats by her side and is able to rearrange itself in a mere instant. In particular, it has 3 “Cavalry Formes” that it can switch between as a free action on Calista’s turn: Knight Forme - Acts as a summon that has its own basic attack action and that Calista is able to control however she pleases. The knight must stay within 10 ft of Calista, and its shield allows it to act as cover for anyone standing behind it. Any damage it takes is redirected to Calista, but with 1 damage reduction. Cavalier Forme - The armor morphs to take the shape of a phantom horse that Calista rides, while her main weapon is transformed into a spear. While riding the horse, Calista’s movement is increased by four and she can act in the middle of a movement and continue to move afterwards. Royal Guard Forme - The armor fits itself onto Calista, acting as direct protection for her. This reduces her movement to 4, but gives her a natural 2 damage reduction. 26. Bolstering The Troops - Calista has the Cavalier’s movement increased by an extra 2. 35. Stand Your Ground - If Calista does not use her movement action on a turn while she is in Royal Guard Forme, she can perform two basic attacks for the price of one."
ability,Calista,Assembling Forces,1,,"A purple aura flares up around Calista and her Epithet as various new armor pieces are spawned into the air. These armor pieces then surround an object of Calista’s choice before fusing with said object, transforming it into a vehicle of some kind. The vehicle, as one may expect, possesses qualities related to the object used to make it. (22): Automatic Automobile - Calista can now cause vehicles created with Assembling Forces to move without there being a driver inside."
ability,Calista,To the Rescue,2!,,"When someone’s in danger, Calista’s senses go into overdrive as either she and/or her Epithet lunges towards them. They then parry the attack, negating it and potentially allowing them to counterattack. If the Epithet is used to parry while in Knight Forme, and the attack would pull it out of its “10ft from Calista” range, Calista dashes alongside to allow the parry to occur. This ability has no range limit aside from Calista and/or her Epithet being on the same battlefield as the ally/area she is trying to protect. Once per round."
ability,Calista,Final Charge into Battle,3!,,"Calista’s eyes shine a deep purple as she points forward, sending a small battalion of spectral cavaliers charging in a line. If the cavaliers collide with a wall or solid object, they bank shot off of it until all of their movement has been used up. This ability works best when timed correctly, as each round that it goes unused adds 5 movement and 4 damage to the battalion. If used in particularly dire moments, the battalion will “break the armor” of those they hit, cutting their movement stat in half their next turn and causing attacks on them to roll with advantage for 1d4 rounds. Upon use of this ability, all of the stacks it has built up over the combat are reset to 0. Once per round."
ability,Calista,Stallion Stampede,3⛯,,"Calista raises her sword in the area as her Epithet sends a pulse of energy in a 5x5 area around her. She, and every ally within the pulses’ radius, then mount armor in Cavalier Forme and charge forward. They have movement equal to the sum of all the involved allies’ base movement, and deal half of the sum of all their basic attack damage to every enemy they collide with. Once per combat."
weapon,Godric,Decay,,,Godric's left gauntlet has powers over death and deals 6 damage at 2 range. If a 19+ is rolled on this gauntlet the target is held in shadowy tendrils that drains them of 1 stamina (this damage cannot be buffed) at the start of their turn and healing Godric for the same. The tendrils are attached to the ground and not his gauntlets.
weapon,Godric,Desire,,,"Godric's right gauntlet has powers over life and growth, healing 4 stamina at 2 range but cannot be used on himself. If a 19+ is rolled he can either heal himself for half of the healing applied or chain half of the healing applied onto another ally up to 6 range away."
talent,Godric,He Just Covers The Whole Damn Screen,,,Godric is considered a 3x3 tile and anything that increases his size category has doubled effectiveness. He has +1 range and +2 damage when using physical attacks. He will always return to a 3x3 at the end of combat. (Note: All numbers in the character sheet are updated to match this.)
passive,Godric,Equinox of the Soul,,,"Godric’s soul is an amalgamation of 3 beings, while the human part mostly reformed into his epithet and the base for his physical form, the other two powers are in a battle for dominance within him. Whenever Godric rolls a 16+ he is filled with overflowing life energy that radiates around him that buffs the damage his allies deal by +1 and giving him a +2 to all damaging actions. If Godric rolls a Nat 20 he can increase the damage of his allies by +1 for the rest of the combat. Whenever Godric rolls 5 or under a lethargic feeling emanates through the combat area lowering the damage done by enemies by 1 and giving his allies a +3 to all non-damaging actions, however all of his own damage is halved. If Godric rolls a Nat 1 he can give his allies a +1 to all their non-damaging actions for the rest of combat. If Godric rolls a 10, 11 or combat ends he resets back to neutral, otherwise these effects remain in effect, only the Nat 1 and Nat 20 effects stack."
ability,Godric,Blame Your Own Weakness,5,,"Godric can only use this ability once he has been reduced to 50% stamina and only once per combat. Godric picks up the nearest two enemies and crushes them together in his giant fucking gauntlets dealing 6 damage to each of them. He then throws one onto the ground dealing another 4 damage and drags the other one with him up to 5 spaces slamming them into the ground for 6 more damage. If he wishes he can choose to roll again for the slam, if he rolls a 17+ he may drag that target away up to another 5 spaces and slam them on the ground again for another 4 damage and once more they can choose to roll for this attack and if they roll 18+ they can do it once more."
ability,Godric,Do *Not* Touch Me,2!,,Godric may be a fight maniac but he’s also really finicky about being touched. Whenever he is directly touched by anyone for any reason he may create shadowy tentacles that move the one that touched him 1 space out of the range required to touch him. The target is held there till the end of the current turn. If the same person tries to touch him again before the end of their next turn Godric may use this ability to counter attack them instead for 5 damage. Once per round.
ability,Godric,Suspension of Morality,3⛯,,"Once per combat Godric can target a person and splits them in two causing their good and evil to detach from each other, they look like shadowy static versions of the original. Only one of the two can deal damage and the other is the only one that can support their team splitting their damaging and non-damaging abilities between them, but also gives them a +3 to performing those actions, they have separate initiative rolls. The damage version gains a basic attack with 8 points that they split between damage and range in anyway they feel. The support gains a 1 cost healing ability with 6 points that they can split between healing and range in anyway they feel. Their stamina values are equal to half of the stamina they had when they initially split. After 2 rounds of being split (starting from their first turns respectively) the damage dealing one must roll a d100 and if they roll 25 or below they must attack an ally (this also includes their good self) that turn, this becomes progressively harder the longer they are split. Godric can reform the two halves into one again after 3 rounds, he does not have to roll for it but it still costs 3 stamina to do so and it does take his action for that turn. They reform naturally after combat."
weapon,Snowy,Pillow,,,"It’s a pillow. Super comfy! Heals 3 health if someone rests on it, or deals 2 damage if she full force wacks someone with it."
talent,Snowy,I'm stiiiiiiill in a snaaake,,,"Snowy has collected a bunch of dandelions from her constant travels, which she can take out at any time! Using her epithet, she can blow on them and make a smol illusion."
passive,Snowy,Spooked Sheep,,,"This fluffy and innocent bean scares quiet easily, giving her ""Spook Stacks."" These stacks are gained whenever something terrifying happens! When she gets to 40, she falls asleep as her dreamweaving powers take over. This acts as a use of Counting Sheep on herself that creates a manifestation of her nightmares based on what spooked her."
ability,Snowy,Dream Weaver,3,,"Snowy takes a dream she’s been preparing out of her backpack, puts someone to sleep, and gives it to them! This refreshes them, giving them 3 stamina, as well as a big bonus! She can influence this a bit, because, y'know, she made the dream. While of note, they only appear to be asleep for the duration of Snowy's turn, waking up well rested on the end of her turn, as well as having a nice dream that lasted far longer than the time they were asleep."
ability,Snowy,Quick Knit,2!,,"In a panic, Snowy takes out a bunch of wool and knits something reallyreallyfast, resulting in the object being created real quick. It also has the same functionality as the real thing. Like a wall. Or a quilt! Or a sword. ...Or a quilt! Once per Round."
ability,Snowy,Counting Sheep,3⛯,,"Snowy puts a bunch of energy into her epithet by creating a super comfy blanket! It is, in fact, so comfortable, that anyone who touches it might as well go straightthefuck to sleep. This restores them 3 health, but also makes whatever they may dream about into their new form for the duration of the nap, manifesting as a creature next to them that they can control. This could be someone or something that completely haunts them, or maybe their crush. It’s effect varies quite a bit, as does its embarrassment factor! Of note, they have full control over this entity and what it does. The effect can be stopped by waking the target up. Once per Combat."
weapon,Kaemon,The Delta Sleeper,,,"Basically it’s a fuckin’ lightsaber, bought by Tera as a birthday gift for you. Deals 7 damage at 1 range. The color of the blade also changes based on its cipher, which is a cool cosmetic touch!"
talent,Kaemon,All According to Keikaku,,,"Kaemon always comes into a fight with a strategy to win. At the start of combat, he can privately tell the GM a trap of some kind or plan of action he has to deal with the current scenario. If he completes the plan, he gains +1 proficiency."
talent,Kaemon,*SHING*,,,"Instead of taking a movement action, Kaemon can adjust his glasses to cause a flash of blinding light. This makes it so that no one adjacent to him can perform anytimes for the rest of his turn."
passive,Kaemon,Imprint Encryption,,,"Whenever you use an ability, you may spend an additional stamina to “cipher” it onto a nonliving item within 3 range, for example your weapon. This stores the information of that ability on it, causing the ability to become an additional effect of the item, casting for free when the item is used (or when you attack with a weapon, if it is ciphered to one). This cannot be used to use an ability more than its limits allow (so you can’t cheat Once Per Combat limits). If the effect needs a target, it will target whatever the item is being used on. If using the item does not require a roll, then you must roll for the cipher’s effect to happen. Objects can only have one cipher on them at a time. Ciphers can only activate a max of once per round. Inscribe in Flesh - You can cipher onto people, specifically a part of their body. If they perform an action with that part, then the cipher activates. [19 Prof] RISE MY LEGION!! - By spending an additional 2 stamina when ciphering an object, Kaemon may imbue a part of his will into the item along with the ability. This causes the object to come to unlife as a zombie-like minion! They generally have 5 movement, 5 stamina, and access to the ability they’re ciphered with, but these traits may be slightly different depending on the item. Does not work with Inscribe in Flesh."
passive,Kaemon,Crypto Currency,,,"At the start of the session, Kaemon names a number between 1 and 20. Whenever that number is rolled within Kaemon’s sight, his red stat “Kaemoncoin” goes up by 1. He can spend 1 of these as a bonus action to immediately create any mundane item no bigger than a 1x1 tile, or can be spent to increase rolls by +2 each."
ability,Kaemon,Of Course I Know The Mystery,3,,"Oh god oh fuck I don’t know the mystery. Kaemon wants to look like a cool intelligent anime character, which often causes them to make bold leaps of logic. In order to look less stupid, he can manifest this into an actual real thing. Basically, he spins a fancy complicated set of logic that reveals some strange cryptid or fable is the REAL DEAL and is the reason behind something! This summons that thing or causes the events of that tale to happen."
ability,Kaemon,Crypto-Form,1,,"Encrypt the very existence of an object, camouflaging it to be entirely invisible. It’s still there though. If used on a living thing the invisibility deactivates once they perform a non-movement main action. You can also dispel the invisibility at will."
ability,Kaemon,Source Code,1,,"Reverse engineer an ally’s ability, cracking the code to gain their ability for the rest of combat. You can only have one ability copied from an ally at a time and you don’t get to cast it as a part of using this ability. [29 Prof] You can cast the ability you’re copying with Source Code as a part of your initial copying roll and action."
ability,Kaemon,Welcome... to my LAIR!,2!,,"Kaemon reveals that you’ve FALLEN INTO HIS DOMAIN, creating a 2x2 area of DARKNESS in which enemies roll disadvantage within. Meanwhile, Kaemon is completely aware of all happenstances within the darkness, and can use ciphered items at a stronger potency while inside it as your LAIR is better suited for you to use your dastardly tools. Once per round. [15 Prof] Your lairs are now 3x3."
weapon,Vis,Idle Power,,,Vis is able to feel idle bits of epithet energy in the air. He may harness this power as a 3 range 4 damage attack that has extra effects depending on epithets within the area. Either the one closest to him or the most powerful one is usually the one the most power is gained from.
weapon,Vis,Mythril,,,"A sword comprised of a strange crystal from a far-off country. This material can retain some amount of an epithet’s power when channeled into it, but because of a choice he made, it is forever bound to Toxicant. Vis can effectively channel this epithet as if it were present in the combat. The sword deals 7 (+3 poison) damage at 1 range. As a once per combat finishing move, Vis may perform a massive sweeping slash that deals 14 damage at 1 range and can perform an additional epithetical effect based on ""Toxicant."" Depending on the roll for any given attack, the target gets a Poison debuff they can attempt to shrug off. Toxicant may also be used as an epithet. 1-7: 1d4. 8-14: 1d6. 15-19: 1d8. 20+: 1d10."
passive,Vis,Epithet Communique,,,"Vis has the power to freely commune and talk, understand and bond with epithets as though they were people. The relationship between epithets and their wielders can be complex. Sometimes it’s an unfair, abusive relationship and sometimes it’s a deeper connection than family. He’s also able to see, to an extent, “Physical Manifestations” of the epithet. Epithets general appearance generally give a hint to the targets epithet and powers. The appearance and form vary wildly. Note: All Epithet related abilities that rely on the other person also rely on the epithets personification to work with them. Epithets as he perceives them can affect him in odd ways (like straight up damaging him). He also has a trustworthy aura about himself. Another Note: When Umbra gains this power, her eyes turn black and white just like Vis's."
passive,Vis,Epithet Chakra,,,"Whenever you somehow channel or ask for the help from an epithet, they leave a bit of their power with you. This grants you a Chakra of that epithet. When you gain one, define what small passive effect or ability modifier it grants you. You can have three Epithet Chakras active at once, although you can replace an old one when you channel a new one. You also lose them at the end of combat."
passive,Vis,Preordain,,,"Vis’ psychology skills and mystical powers combine to allow Vis to predict and enforce people’s behaviors. At the start of each combat, for each Epithet user involved, Vis rolls a d20 corresponding to each person. As an anytime action Vis can replace that person’s roll with the one he divined they would get earlier. Once combat ends all portent dice that weren’t expended are lost automatically."
passive,Vis,Foresight,,,"Vis is able to seemingly predict his enemy’s movements within his mind. Upon an epithet user enemy walking into or out of your basic attack range, you can immediately perform a basic attack on them. This attack gets +1 to its damage if you’re using that person’s epithet for your Idle Power’s bonus effect. This can only be used once per round normally, but can be triggered again after its normal usage by using Concentration. 41: Foresight works whenever someone moves within his basic attack range instead of just through its border. Battle Trance - Vis may now increase or decrease the range of Foresight on his turn, so long as it is no more than Idle Power’s range."
passive,Vis,Tounge of the Oracle,,,"The mystical power which Vis holds now lets him not only predict the future, but enact his will on it through language. Once per combat at any time, without the need of a roll, Vis may utter a word and alter an event that is about to happen based on that word. For example, he may say “backfire” when an enemy fires a gun and the gun explodes, or he could say “bleed” and an attack will cause the target significant blood loss. This effect is powerful enough that it can even have moderate (but not drastic) effect on Outclass level powers. However it has limits: he cannot force people to do certain actions, and he cannot cause something that is literally impossible to occur."
ability,Vis,Two Can Play at This Game...,2,,"With the targeted Epithet’s permission, Vis outstretches a hand and borrows an epithet’s power within 6 range. Using this, Vis can: Uses an epithet-based ability that he has seen the target use. (Non Once Per Combat) (1 Stamina). Create an effect/ability himself regarding the epithet (2 Stamina). Or store the epithet power for future use, as a free action (3 Stamina). 29: +1 range to Two Can Play At This Game….. 47: Each Two Can Play At This Game… effect’s stamina costs are decreased by 1. (Updated to reflect this.)"
ability,Vis,Role Reversal,0,,"Vis outstretches a hand to an epithet close to him as an invitation to possess him temporarily. The Epithet may freely enter and control Vis’ body, with a few noticeable changes in demeanor and such. Vis can still slightly control his body, but the epithet has the most say. It can take a “Turn” in Vis’ place, getting a movement and regular action. It takes stamina from Vis’ health if an ability is used. After taking their action/movement, they exit the body and Vis has full control again. This ability is a free action and guaranteed success. 39: Role Reversal can now be used on Gold and up rarity tarot cards."
ability,Vis,Concentration,2!,,"Vis focuses on a targets epithet, in an attempt to guess and counter what they’re doing. Epithets can give away what the person will do far before they will. This can be used to attempt to counter/reflect an attack sent towards him. This can also be used against mundies, at a 0 cost and a disadvantaged roll. Once per Round. With either version, he may harness a prevalent epithet around him (with its permission) to add slight properties to the counter."
ability,Vis,Spiritual Advisement,1,,"Using this ability, Vis attempts to make a compelling case to an epithet or epithet user to change how they think of and interact with the other. Since this is a main action with a stamina cost it has a lot of heart and soul poured into it, making Vis’ words more thought out and moving. Of course, the convincing-ness and quality of the speech itself still heavily impacts this power’s success. If it succeeds, you can alter how an epithet’s powers work, how it affects its user, how a user sees their word and thus applies it, etc for a short time. If your speech is good enough and both parties accept, these effects may stay permanently. Note: these are changes, not added boosts. This ability can’t increase the power of something, at least not without weakening something else. Bonus Action."
ability,Vis,Hand in Hand,1!,,"Vis calls upon an epithet nearby or one he has a card of, allowing himself to spectrally overlay a physical trait from the epithet’s form over himself. Despite being able to physically alter things, no one but himself can see the change. This can be used to either augment an action Vis is taking or to perform a simple action with the alteration, after which it vanishes. If used while Role Reversal is active this costs 0 stamina and automatically succeeds. Once per round."
ability,Vis,This is the Trance,3⛯,,"Upon using this, Vis enters a strange trance as he allows his body and mind to channel energies and insights freely without constraint. While this is active, you can sustain Role Reversal to allow an epithet to continue to inhabit you for as long as it wants while this ability is active. After the initial usage, the epithet and Vis must share their action economy and work together to determine a course of action. If they can’t agree, the possession ends. In addition, whenever Vis would be hit by an attack, even if he can’t sense it coming, he may instinctively dodge it and any other attacks happening simultaneously by paying 5 stamina, moving a number of spaces needed to exit any AoE if necessary (can’t move Vis more than twice his movement speed via this). This does not require a roll and can be used multiple times in a round, but the cost cannot be reduced or negated via normal methods and each time it is used in the same round the cost increases by 1. This ability has an upkeep of 3, however the upkeep increases by 1 every round it is active. Bonus action, once per combat."
ability,Vis,Tajitu Typhoon,3,,"Vis channels as much epithet energy he can from around him and fires it around him. If this succeeds, Vis may immediately make 3 Idle Power attacks (which are rolled for separately). Each one that hits unlocks a different follow up, which you must choose one of and then roll for that to perform. - Yin - Can only be chosen if the first Idle Power attack hits. Vis vanishes into darkness, teleporting adjacent to one of the targets hit by Taijitu Typhoon and slashes them with a melee weapon. This roll has a +2 critical hit range.  - Emptiness - Can only be chosen if the second Idle Power attack hits. Vis expels all impurity within himself. Make one final Idle Power attack. If it hits you may transfer any debuffs you are currently suffering from you to the hit target.  - Yang - Can only be chosen if the third Idle Power attack hits. Vis channels positive energy into himself, healing for 5 stamina. - Monad - Can only be chosen if all the Idle Power attacks hit. Vis pulls out his sword and vanishes, slashing every space within a radius of his position equal to Idle Power’s range. Make 3 attacks with a melee weapon of your choice that hits every enemy in the area."
weapon,Persephone,Parasol,,,Persephone is pretty averse to direct sunlight so she has this parasol for when she goes outside. It deals 5 damage at 2 range. Sleep Shade - The sleeping effect of Persephone’s Parasol now activates when she’s at 75% and now activates on rolls of 12+ while awakened. It now has 2 range.
talent,Persephone,Sight Beyond Sight,,,"A stuffed bun named Alora that Cecilia gave Persephone on the day they ran away from home. It has some effects of Cecilia’s epithet and allows Persephone to hide herself away in a sub-dimension for 2 turns, she is still able to interact with the outside world using her allies as a conduit for her abilities, if she has no allies she may still use this but will lose her connection to the outside world. Once per round."
passive,Persephone,Eyes Wide Shut,,,"Persephone is almost constantly asleep, this is due to the events that occur when she becomes fully awake. She always starts combat asleep with fully closed eyes and she usually falls asleep again when combat ends. Different effects happen depending on how awake she is but they do stack. Every 25% of stamina lost (damage, costs or other) opens her eyes by one stage or if there is a legitimate RP reason for her eyes to be opened (unless it is through stamina draining her eyes may not open more than two full stages per round). The cost and effectiveness of her abilities are changed depending on how awake she is, this should be stated in the ability text. If she reaches 50% of her maximum stamina after being below 25% of their stamina she starts to become sleepy again and reverts back to her 50% state. Closed: All of Persephone’s abilities cost 1 or less stamina but have halfed or less effectiveness. 25%: Persephone’s abilities cost 1 less than their true cost (minimum of 1) and her allies gain +1 to all their rolls. 50%: Persephone’s abilities cost the normal amount but she gains a +3 to all rolls and an expanded crit range of 19+. 75%: Persephone’s damage increases by 3 and her allies have their rolls increased by +2 and damage increased by 1. Open: The first time her eyes open in a combat she cannot go below 1 stamina till the end of her next or current turn (including if her going to 0 or less stamina was the cause of her eyes awakening, she will only go to 1) she also gains a +1 to all rolls. While her eyes are open everyone in the combat, aside from Persephone, starts falling asleep giving them a -4 to all of their rolls until they fall asleep after at least 2 rounds. When a character is asleep they act as though under the effects of Persephone’s “Closed Eyes” state and their -4 becomes a -2. Additionally anyone within 10ft of Persephone is drained of 1d4+1 stamina per round and Persephone gains at least half of that rounded up. Cecilia Erebus is immune to the negative effects. This form lasts until the end of combat or if she is somehow sent back to sleep again, she may not do this herself unless she has an ability that states that she can."
ability,Persephone,Vigil of the Dead,1\1\2\3,,"By setting up a small ritual Persephone can temporarily gain control of a target’s soul. Persephone can target a living or formerly living creature and create a dark shadowy version of them to act as minions for them. They have about 5 stamina, but may get more depending on the roll and take on the theming of their epithet allowing them attempt actions relating to that and basic equal to the target, if they do no not have an epithet they get access to a basic attack that does +2 damage to the original, if that original was something without defined parameters then the GM should give them a basic attack befitting their station, if the epithet is unknown then the gm may give an example of something this minion is capable of. She may only have one of these at a time. This has a harder time affecting healthy non-mook enemies. They always disappear at the end of combat. 25%: No additional affects. 50%: She may now have up to two minions out at a time and target two at once when activating this ability.

ability,Persephone,Death by Sleep,0!\2,,"Persephone can see potential futures from peoples dreams, almost all of them to do with all the possible ways they might die. ≤50%: A target within 3 spaces of herself or an ally gains a sudden discomforting feeling like something that shouldn’t be known has now become visible. This gives them a -3 to their next roll and everyone else has a +3 to hit them for 1 round. Once per round and may not be used on the same target in a row. ≥75%: A target in the area is shown one of the many possible and sometimes brutal ways they might die and the after effects that might come from it, this gives them a -5 to trying to wake up from sleep (for 1 round) as they try to reject reality gives allies a +5 to hit that target for 1 round.

For every time Aorta is attacked, they get 1 point in their red stat - Ferocity. Aorta may spend 4 Ferocity for another action once per round. They can only provoke someone using this passive once on their turn."
passive,Aorta,"**Oh, and also they’re deaf.**",,,"Aorta doesn’t take damage from audio sources, or at least takes miniscule damage. They are also unable to make saving throws or react in general to things that could have only been sensed through sound. Although, someone speaking directly into their mind gets them really freaked out. However, due to them not having to focus on hearing, all of their other senses are slightly increased, especially sight."
ability,Aorta,**Glass**,3,,"Aorta dashes 4 spaces in a straight line (+2 for every Ferocity spent) and bashes someone as hard as they can manage, dealing 5 damage to the target and 3 damage to everyone in a 3x2 area behind the target. For everyone they’ve Provoked along the way, Aorta deals an additional damage. The limit on Troublemaker does not apply on this ability. If Aorta successfully attacks her target with this ability, she cannot use it again until the end of her next turn."
ability,Aorta,**Dust**,2!,,"Aorta brandishes their guitar and moves up to 6 spaces over to someone. If it’s an ally, they take the attack directed at them. If it’s an enemy, Aorta deals 3 damage, +1 for each 3 Ferocity they have. This ability costs 0 if Aorta is below 10 health. This anytime refreshes at the end of Aorta’s turn."
ability,Aorta,Blast,0!,,A simple melee attack that deals 2 damage and 1 knockback. Cannot be used to counter attacks. Once per Round.
ability,Aorta,Sonic Wave,3,,"Aorta pulls out their guitar and shreds. This deals 6 damage in a 2 space radius of them, with friendly fire. Hit targets are knocked back. In addition, Aorta may choose to either give herself a Ferocity, or give an ally a non-stacking +2 roll buff on their next action as they're inspired."
weapon,Astra,Megaton Lotus,,,"A huge impractical pair of combat-modified blacksmithing tongs. It’s surface shimmers with a star-like pattern. Astra swings it with an unusually practiced ease, and despite not remembering why she uses a giant pair of tongs, she considers it an extension of herself. Deals 5 damage at 2 range, and can be used to clamp onto or around something or someone within range as a part of the attack, forcing a contested roll, would they attempt to escape the iron-like grasp on their turn. Astra cannot use movement while clamping someone. "
talent,Astra,Retribution,,,"If you feel like someone has explicitly used you, manipulated you, or taken total advantage of your kindness in a severe manner, you gain 1 Retribution. Retribution can be spent at anytime speed (though it is specifically *not* counted as an anytime) to immediately grant a free attacking action and movement against/towards a target who has wronged you or your allies. During this action, your first roll gains advantage with a crit range extended to 17+, and all other rolls beyond that crit on rolls of 19+, no advantage."
talent,Astra,Defense Crusher,,,"Astra has remembered her mastery of the art of counterattack, analysing targets defences as she strikes. When using an anytime to counterattack or shut down an adjacent enemy's attack, she rolls with a +3. If an adjacent enemy attempts an offensive anytime while adjacent to her, it gains -3 as she strikes to disrupt them."
talent,Astra,I Hate Sand,,,"You have resistance to purely natural-based environmental effects such as sandstorms, difficult terrain such as swamps, and damaging ground like sharp rocks or the like."
passive,Astra,Kaleidoscopic Soul,,,"Multiple shards of a powerful crystalline material are embedded throughout Astra’s body, the largest piece being the one within her heart. As a result of their mysterious effects and her natural “epithet empathy” fusing together, she may take on “the colour” of powerful epithet users she defeats or becomes incredibly close with permanently. At base, colours start with a passive and ability or basic attack, but Astra may put proficiency into them to strengthen and learn new skills with it. As a movement action on Astra’s turn she may swap her current colour, granting her access to it’s features. Anyone attempting to copy this passive will instead gain a severely weakened version. - Colours - Brown Contentment (0) - An insatiable desire to love and be loved, to care and be cared for swells like stuffing within your heart. Undying loyalty and a warm hug are always within your grasp. Passives: Handy Little Helpers - As a bonus action on her turn Astra may create a small teddy bear which she can control on her turn to assist in any way she sees fit. These bears have 6 movement, 2 stamina, roll with advantage when fixing or crafting-related actions, and can roll to hug allies, healing 1 stamina. Maximum of 3 little helpers at a time. Abilities: Bear With Me (3) - Astra poses as a huge stuffed bear forms within 2 spaces of her. This savagely soft creature may then immediately take a move and action. Bears have 8 stamina, 2 DR against bludgeoning damage, and act on Astra’s turn. They have a 2 damage hug basic attack that holds the target in place and gives their actions a -3. Additionally, if someone adjacent to them gets attacked they may roll to jump in front, taking the hit instead, and finally they may roll to give a target a “bear hug” to heal for 3. 1 bear at a time. Vermilion Vibrato (6) - A deep, powerful vibration resonates within your being. It desires to rip apart all matter within its path, and you have no intention of stopping it. Passives: Reverberating Annihilation - You may pay 1 stamina or your move action to channel the intense vibrations of Vermillion into a body part or basic attack, allowing you to cut straight through incredibly strong materials with ease with any object, in the case of basic attacks they get a small damage buff, and ignore DR, shields, and the like. You may also channel these vibrations into abilities, enhancing their effects with Vermillion’s power; Usually this manifests the same way as with basic attacks (+dmg, ignore DR, destroy terrain/objects), but you may attempt to bend it for different effects. Abilities: Hypersonic Supercutter (3) - Astra winds up the Megaton Lotus as a deep red power vibrates out from and within her, obliterating anything directly on or around her she wishes. Upon hitting critical charge she swings down savagely, sending a vertical 8 damage 1x3 hypersonic wave of destruction up to 8 spaces away. This slash cannot be stopped by conventional means, and reduces anything unlucky enough to be in its path to rubble. 3: Quick Vibrations - Hypersonic Supercutter no longer requires movement. By spending half movement, Astra can make it a 1x3 horizontal slash instead. Violent Velocity (1)! - Astra’s form becomes blurry as she briefly channels the vibrations throughout her whole body. Move 3 spaces, phasing through an attack or obstacle."
ability,Astra,...This One’s *Gotta* Work,X,,"Astra gets a really cool idea for an attack or creation, and the irresistible urge to make it a reality. This one will work. Promise. Come up with a cool special attack utilising general ki and/or the rough powers of Astra’s current colour, or using things in her immediate area put together a special item/weapon/something with incredible finesse, this creation may have properties of Astra’s current colour. Each time this ability fails Astra’s frustration builds, giving her a +2 to it’s next usage. Cost is decided by the DM, and mostly depends on the strength of the creation/technique. "
ability,Astra,Iridescent Overdrive,3+X,,"Astra forces the powers within her to coalesce into one beautiful hue for a second, then releases it in a huge show of power. Take two abilities from any two colours and combine them into a unique super ability utilising the aspects of each. You may choose to incorporate more colours into the mix, paying an additional stamina for each one. "
ability,Astra,Retribution Goddess’s Judgment,3,,"A technique Astra seems to have drilled into her body and mind before she lost her memories…. After focusing her energy completely into enhancing her body, Astra dashes like a flash of lightning towards a target within her movement, leaving a trail of her current colour behind her. Upon reaching her target she may choose one of two actions. This ability has a 1 turn cooldown.  EXECUTION- Astra grasps the target's head, slamming it into the ground as energy explodes out from her hand. This deals 10 damage, and on good rolls the sheer force of the explosion disorents the target, stopping them from moving or using anytimes for a round. On rolls 18+ the target is partially embedded in the ground and must roll to escape, attacks against them in this state have a +3.  EXPULSION- Astra lands a punch square into the target’s gut (or general centre of gravity) with an almighty impact. Her fist remains for a second, digging into the target before she finishes the arc, sending them rocketing up to 10 spaces away in the direction of Astra’s choosing and dealing heavy damage if they collide with something. Good rolls may increase the knockback or allow Astra to add extra effects based on how she hits the target. "

She may do this any number of times, but if she uses this out of her turn, she must wait until her turn comes around again to relocate it. (For ease of kit writing and use, she will only have one 10x10 dimension.) She may instead open a 2-way portal and enter it immediately thrice per combat."
passive,Cynthia,**Baptize in Dread**,,,"Cynthia usually prefers personal, one on one fights, but breaking a group of people is easy enough for her...She lives for seeing their fear come to life in front of their eyes, seeing dread fill them up, seeing them keel over and realize that their chances of victory are fading away to dust...That’s why she LIVES. If people are watching Cynthia make a grisly attack or knock someone out/kill someone, they get one stack of Fear applied, and at certain thresholds, effects take place. 1 - A pang of paranoia. 3 damage Once per Combat to anyone who reaches this point. 2 - The target gets 1 Butcher. 3 - Defensive anytimes cannot be used against Cynthia’s attacks. 5 - Cynthia gets a stored critical success against the target."

passive,Cynthia,Maim,,,"Cynthia can at any point halve the damage she deals to put a debuff on a target. Using this disables a passive, talent, or ability (specifically that has a physical equivalent), as well as putting on: Butcher - For the next 3 turns, the target cannot heal. If they go to 5 health, they’re knocked out instead."
passive,Cynthia,[EXECUTION],,,"Every round, if 25 damage isn’t dealt to Cynthia, she gains access to an [EXECUTION ABILITY] CHAIN & GUILLOTINE (5) - Cynthia wraps a target up in a chain, before a massive 1x5 Guillotine Blade manifests above them. Cynthia may spend 15 additional stamina to wrap up, relocate, and restrain up to 3 additional targets. The Guillotine Blade deals half max stamina of the target with the highest max health caught in the blade. (ex. If someone with 30 and 80 max stamina are caught, 40 damage is dealt.) The damage dealt is irreducible (through DR, AC, etc.), but dodgeable GALLOWS (3) - Cynthia just takes a target and holds them around the neck, a rope manifesting around them and hoisting them 6 spaces into the air. The rope is pretty tough. It’s tight around their neck. Every turn, they take gradually increasing damage and fear. If the target has a turn whilst they are restrained, they instead take it after they are released. Max of 2."
ability,Cynthia,Trisection,3,,"Cynthia creates two portals across the target. The portal by itself is too weak to cut across a person, but it’s devastating nonetheless. This puts two portals across the target, and deals 9 damage, trapping them in that spot and allowing Cynthia to do a follow-up action at half effectiveness."

Deals 5 damage at 1 range, and damage goes through damage reduction and Etherealness. This weapon can interact with the phantom plane.

talent,Seda,Will-o’-the-Wisp,,,"As the night gets darker, stray spirits known as Wisps manifest. At odd numbered Haunt stacks, you may create a Wisp on the field.

Seda can use her movement action to switch teleport with a Wisp."
talent,Seda,Surprise Attack! Hiyaa!,,,"The first time in a turn Seda lands an attack she makes with advantage or that’s made from some form of stealth or surprise, she may add +1d6 Spirit Damage to the attack’s damage."
passive,Seda,Hallow Monitor,,,"As Seda fights, she draws out the spirits of the world in the arena as things slowly become darker and spookier, faint wisps dotting the field. While Seda is present, the arena itself can gain Haunt stacks. This usually starts at 0, although spooky areas can start with more and explicitly haunted areas can start with a lot. These cap out at 10. Whenever Seda critically succeeds on an attack or ability, Haunt stacks increase by 1. Three times per combat Seda can spend her movement to increase Haunt stacks by 1. As more Haunt stacks are applied, the arena becomes cloaked in shadow and various parts of Seda’s kit begin activating. Most notably: all units deal bonus Spirit Damage on their first successful attack of the turn equal to the current Haunt stacks. Seda herself is immune to Spirit Damage. In addition: At 3 stacks, Seda becomes invisible while moving, either through movement actions or movement during attacks or abilities. At 5 stacks, Seda gains advantage when attacking from flanking with her allies. At 7 stacks, Seda gains an additional main and move action. At 10 stacks, Seda gains a new Soul Stance."

passive,Seda,I-I’m Going Ghost!,,,"As a half ghost, Seda is able to see into, interact with, and shift into the phantom plane where ghosts reside. As a free action on her turn Seda can pass over, becoming translucent. In this state she can fly and move through solid objects. Everyone outside of the Phantom Plane treats Seda as Ethereal, but Seda treats everyone outside of the Phantom Plane as Ethereal to her as well."
ability,Seda,Consecrated Ground,1,,"As a once per round bonus action Seda performs a silent rite that causes the area around her in a 5x5 space to become hallowed by the dead. This area deals a passive 1 Spirit Damage to anyone in the area every turn on initiative. Anyone inside can spend 5 Spirit Stacks before they make a roll to give it advantage, and can spend 3 Spirit Stacks to add a ghostly property to their attack. These effects are once per round and cannot be used against Seda. The first time you use this successfully in a combat, increase Haunt stacks by 1. Seda may dispel these areas on her turn. [29 Prof] Objects (including the floor and walls) within your Consecrated Ground cannot be broken, damaged, or destroyed. This does not protect against damage taken nor injuries sustained by living things."
ability,Seda,Soul Stance,2!,,"Seda and her soul (Moyou) are one in the same: two forms of one being. She has mastered various different formations she can take which utilize her soul in combat. This grants her a different passive based on which stance you switch to. You may use this ability without spending stamina or rolling out of combat. This ability’s cost cannot be decreased. This ability is NOT once per round. Fusion Stance - Seda’s soul partially possesses herself. This grants her flight, doubled movement speed, inflicts double Spirit Damage, and a non-stacking +2 to rolls. This stance has upkeep equal to 25% of your current stamina rounding up. Upon switching to Fusion Stance, this ability goes on a round cooldown like a normal anytime. The first time you enter this stance in a combat, increase Haunt stacks by 1. Stutter Stance - Seda’s soul follows Seda like an echo, mimicking everything she does at a slight delay. Whenever you perform an action, you may also have Moyou perform the same action. This does not cost additional stamina for abilities. This action is half as effective rounding down and all of its damage is considered Spirit Damage, but is considered a different attack and requires a separate reaction to deal with (no reaction can be timed to stop both at once). Fakeout Stance - Seda’s soul mimics Seda’s own form perfectly, at the cost of physical power. This places a physically identical copy of Seda onto the field, which she can switch teleport with as a secret free action on her turn. The copy is not actually physically present: it is both immune to everything and cannot affect anything. However, if an opponent attempts to react to an action from Seda’s copy, then the real Seda may capitalize on this and immediately make an attacking action against that person. Empty Stance - Seda’s soul leaves her body and dissipates, turning her into an empty vessel. Whenever Seda takes damage, she becomes Ethereal until the end of the turn. Shade Stance - Seda’s soul turns dark as Seda is cloaked in darkness. Enemies cannot see Seda when she’s a number of spaces away equal to 10 - Haunt stacks where they are, as she blends into the darkness. Whenever you attack from stealth, you may have your attack target some weakness either physically or in their soul. If your attack roll meets the DC of 20 - their number of Spirit Stacks - Haunt stacks where they are, you hit that weakness for an extra effect and 1.5x damage. Regalia Stance - Seda’s soul shapes itself into a blade, letting her turn it into whatever weapon she desires. She can use this weapon as a bonus action, controlled via telepathy. The weapon’s normal state is a 9 damage 1 range weapon, but you may shape it in different ways for different properties. All of Moyou’s damage is dealt as Spirit Damage. Aegis Stance - Seda’s soul becomes an orbiting ball of flame which mitigates incoming attacks. Seda gains DR against the first attack she takes every turn equal to the current Haunt stacks (minimum 1). If this DR completely negates a ranged attack, Seda may roll to reflect it back towards the attacker. This DR cannot reduce melee attacks below 1 damage. Sentry Stance - Seda’s soul exits her body as a flaming sphere of power. It has its own movement action equal to Seda’s movement and a Wisp aura. Whenever someone enters a Wisp aura, Seda may pay 2 stamina to immediately teleport to the Wisp and perform a basic attack against that person. There is no round or turn limit to this. Yokai Stance - Seda’s soul forms itself as a large arm floating by her side. As a once per round anytime action she can have the arm grab a target within its range, pulling them towards you and letting you perform a basic attack follow up. Alternatively it can pull Seda towards other objects at its range like a grappling hook. Range is equal to half your current Haunt stacks rounded down, minimum of 1. [10 Haunt] Abyssal Stance - This stance can only be accessed when Haunt is at 10, and immediately deactivates when lower. The entire arena is cloaked in impermeable black, making it completely impossible to see much of anything that doesn't have a soul. Seda herself is not only completely invisible but simply mingles into the darkness, meaning she isn't on the field and has no initiative anymore. She gains an additional main and move action and can use them as anytimes refreshing at the top of initiative, and can be treated as anywhere on the arena at any time. She can be targeted from anywhere, but the effect has disadvantage (she's invis). Seda is Ethereal when not in the process of performing an action. All of Seda's actions benefit from her sneak attack dice, and they're no longer once per round. This form is incredibly powerful, but has Cumulative Upkeep 1 max stamina while active."
ability,Seda,Undeath Blow,1,,"Seda performs a basic attack against an enemy as everything seems to dramatically slow down after her sword swipe. Then, if the target has Spirit Stacks greater than or equal to their current stamina, all of those Spirit Stacks are expended and the target is knocked to 0 stamina immediately."
ability,Seda,Resting Place,X,,"1-X Gravestones are erected from the earth. These Gravestones each have 10 stamina, are immune to Spirit Damage, and act as hard cover meaning they block attacks attempting to come around or through them and line of sight. Whenever a Gravestone takes damage, it deals equivalent Spirit Damage back to the attacker. X is capped at 3 if used as a main action, or 1 if used as a bonus action. [35 Prof] Whenever a Resting Place gravestone is destroyed, it leaves behind a new Wisp. X’s cap is increased by 1 in both forms."
ability,Seda,Sakura Karei Arashi,X,,"Seda briefly strikes a pose, before vanishing and dashing at incredibly fast speeds around the arena. She immediately moves to a space adjacent to a Wisp and deals 4 damage to every enemy she passes through/next to. She can then keep doing this for each Wisp on the field. This ability’s cost is equal to the number of Wisp jumps you want to make. If you fail the roll, it just costs 2."
ability,Seda,Apparition Armory,2!,,"Seda can manipulate spiritual energy to form temporary weapons, either to parry or add to attacks. She can only create them next to herself, her soul, or targets with Spirit Stacks, and doing so with others requires her to spend an amount of Spirit Stacks from them determined by the GM. All damage dealt by this ability is Spirit Damage. Once per round."

""Cavity"" can attack three times with one action using these and on a 15+ a gumball knuckle bursts, coating the target in gum which reduces their movement by 1 and gives them a -3 to their next physical action. +1 to damage, now the effect triggers on 13+ and the gum can be elementally attuned to apply different status effects."
weapon,Cavity,Taffy Trident,,,"A swirly colorful trident made of malleable stretchy taffy that “Cavity” can contort and control at will! Its ends and shaft can bend and worm around in such ways that it can snake to hit up to three different targets as part of its actions for reduced effects or gang up on somewhere for increased accuracy by attacking them from all sides! 5 Damage 8 Range. +1 to range, +1 damage. now can be used as a once per round anytime to Indiana Jones motherfuckers or deal half damage."
weapon,Cavity,Cocoa Cleaver,,,"“Cavity” chuckles as this one comes out. It’s her favorite option, but hey, versatility and simplicity is best, huh? Taking the form of a massive chocolate bar with bites taken out of it forming a jagged blade, this beast of a weapon doesn’t seem to be sweet like its origin… The Cocoa Cleaver, upon striking in a single square, seems to instantly melt and split off, turning into a 3x5 chocolate wave attack past the person who it initially hits in order to deal half of the weapon’s base damage in that area. 8 Damage 2 Range. +1 to damage, +1 range. The wave now coats the ground in sticky chocolate like a glaze, causing people to roll if they should ever move through there. If they roll 8 or lower, they are stuck in the glaze for at least until the start of their next turn."
weapon,Cavity,Baker's Dozen,,,"A 13 gauge candy shotgun! It loads gumdrop slugs! It deals 4 damage in a [5] space long cone with any targets who the slugs hit having the gumdrops stuck to them. In 1d3 turns, the gumdrops will pop, dealing 1 damage and 3 coatings to the initial targets and 1 to everyone adjacent to them. +2 range. The gumdrops are now phosphoric in nature, exploding out up to two spaces away, dealing the d3 coatings to the targets it’s stuck to and the adjacent targets with 1 coating being placed on the people within the two spaces away range."
weapon,Cavity,Twirly Twirly~,,,"Cavity’s fighting style includes a lot of spinning and twirling, as though she were playing a game or dancing. After making an attack, she may throw any candy weapon she is holding high up into the air, spinning as it goes, before swapping to another one and leaping 3 spaces away. On her next turn, she may have the weapon crash down in a space within 3 range from where she threw it and if it lands in her space she may make an attack with it. Otherwise, it will simply apply a Coating to any unit it drops on."
talent,Cavity,Cybernetic Arm,,,"Cybernetic Arm, biiitch! “Cavity” is missing her left arm and as such got it replaced with a cool robot arm she sees fit to coat with candy sometimes. With this, “Cavity” is considered to always have 5 squares of reach(Effectively they can attack up to 6 spaces away) and her barehanded punch with that arm deals 5 damage with a +one to damage for each space further from one the target is. This damage bonus also applies to any attack she performs using the left hand. She coats it with white chocolate to make it look like her real left arm, however. Enough heat might make it melt, though..."
talent,Cavity,God I Love Candy,,,“Cavity” receives +2 healing from eating candies or confections specifically. [11] Hee Hee~ Delicious! - “Cavity” now receives +4 healing from candy and confections. Only half of this applies to Coatings.
passive,Cavity,Little Cravings,,,"Gaaah…It’s been far too long since I’ve had anything to eat! Hey, you all, help me with that! I need some candy RIGHT NOW!!! Whenever “Cavity” takes an action against a target that makes contact with them they apply a Coating on their body on a location of their choosing. Upon taking a melee action against a target with any number of Coatings “Cavity” may choose to consume however many stacks they choose to add to their Sugar Rush whilst healing an amount of Stamina equal to the amount of Coating stacks consumed. Generally, sweet things such as confections can also add to Sugar Rush at a much lower rate. As “Cavity’s” Sugar Rush rises they become increasingly energetic and manic as they increase in power until they finally cap out and reach their Sugar High. Sugar Rush caps at an amount equal to “Cavity’s” build and “Cavity” may choose to enter Sugar High upon reaching maximum Sugar Rush. Whilst in Sugar High “Cavity” loses half of their Sugar Rush rounded up at the end of  their turn and cannot add to their Sugar Rush. Whenever “Cavity” exits Sugar High they become Dizzy for a round as their body becomes drained due the overwhelming surge of energy. Sugar Rush Bonuses: 4 - “Cavity” gains an extra movement action. 7 - “Cavity” gains an extra bonus action. 12 - “Cavity” gains an extra standard action. Sugar High Bonuses - Whenever “Cavity” would consume Coatings as part of their action they can add the number consumed as bonus damage, knockback, or Start/End Step as candy constructs emerge to aid in their assault. Whenever “Cavity” would take damage equal to or lower than their current Sugar Rush it is halved in effectiveness and they lose a single Sugar Rush if the damage reduction was triggered.If any damage “Cavity” deals is equal to or lower than her Sugar Rush, roll 1d4 and add that to the damage. [21] Exquisite Candies!~ - “Cavity’s” sugar retention levels are through the roof! Seriously, she might be more sugar than person at this point. “Cavity” now keeps the effects of Sugar Rush all throughout Sugar High, even if they go below the threshold required for that effect. Additionally, she gains a new effect during Sugar High. [40] Sugar Crash - Whilst “Cavity” treats everything like a game or a fun performance, she can be REALLY deadly if given the right situation. As part of this upgrade, Cavity gains a Charge action which may take the place of a main, movement, or standard but ONLY for the purpose of using this passive. For each of Cavity’s effects, she has a ‘Charge’ version which gets better if she puts more actions into it and rolls with advantage for each action more than necessary. I’ll…write these eventually."
ability,Cavity,Candy Cache,2,,"Alllllright, just the ol’ axe ain’t doin’ the trick! Time to switch up my game here! “Cavity” claps their hands together before creating a weapon from scratch or from a list she’s made before as gooey candy energy forms and globs together, forming into a new implement of COMBAT! This will act as a new basic weapon she has access to for the combat until someone breaks them or something probably. She may roll to use the weapon as part of the action to create it. Gumball Gauntlets (3 damage, 1 range) - A set of gauntlets with gumballs in the knuckle slots! This is gonna be fun~ ""Cavity"" can attack three times with one action using these and on a 15+ a gumball knuckle bursts, coating the target in gum which reduces their movement by 1 and gives them a -3 to their next physical action. Taffy Trident (5 Damage, 8 Range) - A swirly colorful trident made of malleable stretchy taffy that “Cavity” can contort and control at will! Its ends and shaft can bend and worm around in such ways that it can snake to hit up to three different targets as part of its actions for reduced effects or gang up on somewhere for increased accuracy by attacking them from all sides! Cocoa Cleaver (8 Damage, 2 Range) - “Cavity” chuckles as this one comes out. It’s her favorite option, but hey, versatility and simplicity is best, huh? Taking the form of a massive chocolate bar with bites taken out of it forming a jagged blade, this beast of a weapon doesn’t seem to be sweet like its origin… The Cocoa Cleaver, upon striking in a single square, seems to instantly melt and split off, turning into a 3x5 chocolate wave attack past the person who it initially hits in order to deal half of the weapon’s base damage in that area. Baker’s Dozen (4 damage, 5 range) - A 13 gauge candy shotgun! It loads gumdrop slugs! It deals 4 damage in a [5] space long cone with any targets who the slugs hit having the gumdrops stuck to them. In 1d3 turns, the gumdrops will pop, dealing 1 damage and 3 coatings to the initial targets and 1 to everyone adjacent to them. [35] Locked and Sugarcoated - Every weapon “Cavity” makes with this from now on has +1d2 to be added between the weapon’s stats as you like! Their effects or powers can also be extrapolated should you wish. Your previously made weapons have this and they have an additional effect added on as well! Gumball Gauntlets [1] - +1 to damage, now the effect triggers on 13+ and the gum can be elementally attuned to apply different status effects. Taffy Trident [2] - +1 to range, +1 damage. now can be used as a once per round anytime to Indiana Jones motherfuckers or deal half damage. Cocoa Cleaver [2] - +1 to damage, +1 range. The wave now coats the ground in sticky chocolate like a glaze, causing people to roll if they should ever move through there. If they roll 8 or lower, they are stuck in the glaze for at least until the start of their next turn. Baker’s Dozen [2] - +2 range. The gumdrops are now phosphoric in nature, exploding out up to two spaces away, dealing the d3 coatings to the targets it’s stuck to and the adjacent targets with 1 coating being placed on the people within the two spaces away range."
ability,Cavity,Sweets-Sharpened Smile,2,,"Awww, come on! I just wanna little taste! Lemme get a bite! ""Cavity"" reaches out and creates an epithet-based maw with teeth formed from sharpened bits of candy within 4 spaces before having it bite down on someone! The mouth deals 3 damage and siphons some of the person’s energy, granting it to ""Cavity"" in the process before spitting them out somewhere else within 3 spaces. When ""Cavity"" has siphoned energy in this way, they may treat any candy constructs as though they were Pythos in order to shatter them for an effect based on the siphoned energy as an anytime. The energy siphon does not work on characters whose power is not based on an energy source. Bonus action. [29] Such Big Teeth I Have! - ALL THE BETTER TO GNASH YOU WITH! EEHEHEHEHEHEE!~ Sweets Sharpened Smile now counts as a melee attack for “Cavity” upon performing it and if a target does not have a generic energy source(or at least, not one that “Cavity” is interested in…) she may gain lifesteal from the attack instead of doing energy theft."
ability,Cavity,A Spoonful Of Sugar!,2,,"…Helps my enemies go down!~ In a most delightful waaay!~ ""Cavity"" sings to herself as gooey epithet aura forms in their hand. After a little bit and a few more twirls, she takes on a menacing smile before reeling back and HUCKING the ball at someone! The ball, on contact, will apply 2d4 coatings to the target and deal half as much spectral damage as the aura candy bursts out from within them at all angles. This can be used as a bonus action to only apply 1d4+1 Coatings."
ability,Cavity,Construct Confectionary ,3!,,"Eheehee!~ My own candy castle! Ain’t that idea sweet?! ""Cavity"" claps their hands together, producing viscous epithet energy as they press their hands to the ground, suddenly causing a rumble to be heard. After a split second, massive constructs made of epithetical candy quickly rise from the ground and harden, forming into any shape ""Cavity"" wants! Using this ability, ""Cavity"" gets to make entire walls, staircases, or any other sort of construct out of rock candy wherever she wishes, originating within 4 spaces of herself. The walls typically take up a 3x11 area and the Staircase usually encapsulates an entire 5x5 (Being a spiral stairway and all) but these are not the only things she can make. Anyone who touches these receive 1d2 coatings. After creating these constructs, “Cavity” may use a free action to morph them in any way she wishes on her turn. [38] CAAAANDY ESCALATOOOOR!~ - Upon creating her Construct Confectionary structure, “Cavity” may instantly apply some kind of modifier to it or add another structure as she pleases. On top of this, she may move and phase through the structures she makes and no long needs to just make rock candy structures, being able to make gummy structures or even jam, bread, or other sweets-like constructs, which can be modeled after living creatures but cannot perform very complex commands or have complex modifiers. It is also now twice per round."
ability,Cavity,Gourmet Bakery,2,,"“Cavity” takes a centered stance as she inhales deeply, thinking about her favorite thing…oh, uh, and also the technique’s name I guess. After a few seconds, a pink steam comes off of their body as their epithet begins to flare up. Uh oh. “Cavity” burns off any amount of Sugar Rush they want in order to enter a state of blisteringly hot energy for half as many rounds. In this state, her body automatically burns any status effects out of their body and seems to have their epithet flow out to everywhere near her, causing any inanimate object she touches, even tangentially, to turn into a baked confection of her choice. On top of this, she gains the blistering speed to turn any action she can perform into an anytime once per round. This is a free action install effect with an upkeep of 2. [3] Can’t Catch Me!~ - When “Cavity” activates Gourmet Bakery, she gains extra movement equal to the Sugar Rush spent and if that number is over 10, she can do things like run on walls, ceilings, water, etc. If she stops her movement on any surface like that (and doesn’t secure herself with Candy) she will fall, however."
weapon,Cam,Ink Blaster,,,Cam has a custom-built gun that shoots ink at high speeds. (Perfect for temporarily blinding people when you’re caught investigating somewhere you aren’t supposed to be!) High rolls have a chance to blind. 5 Damage 3 Range.
talent,Cam,Burst Mode,,,"Because Cam’s eyes are cameras, taking a picture is always a bonus action, and he can zoom in increasing his vision."
talent,Cam,Rule of Thirds,,,"Cam gets +3 on rolls that are a multiple of 3, does not apply to 18 (3,6,9,12,15). 74: The 6th Third - Rule of Thirds now activates on 18s, if this happens the action gains 1.5x effectiveness. "
talent,Cam,Photo-Synthesis,,,Taking great pictures gives cam life. Literally. As an anytime free action once per round Cam can roll to take pictures of miraculous things and events to heal himself. Amount healed depends on how cool the photo is. 
passive,Cam,Undeniable Truth!,,,"Cam gets +1 proficiency or +1 stamina if he takes a photograph that busts a myth, works out a magic trick or illusion, or solves a mystery/crime. "
passive,Cam,Mark the Occasion,,,"If Cam gets a good photo of the finishing blow in a combat, then he and all allies in the combat get +1 max stamina. "
passive,Cam,Cutting the Reel,,,"If Cam finds himself in an incredibly dire situation (such as a crit fail or a near/potential knockout situation), a clone sent by his future self will appear from seemingly nowhere and take an action to prevent or attempt to lessen the effects. Can only happen once per round, so the timeline doesn't collapse! "
ability,Cam,Duplex,3⛯,,"Cam can create 3 identical copies of himself, and controls them at will on his turn. They can use one of Cam’s abilities (They cannot create clones) this takes the cost out of their stamina. Clones appear directly next to him, have 4 stamina each, and are weak to water. Once per combat. *Upgrade - Copy Twice Paste Once - Cam gains permanent advantage on an ability of his choice.* CamEra Crew - Cam starts combat having 2 free clones at no cost. Focused Efforts - If Cam is working on something with his clones, only the best of their rolls apply to the action. "
ability,Cam,Capture the Moment,2!,,"Cam takes a picture with his eyes, and copies an ability that he’s seen being used. He can only store 2 abilities at a time, and uses the normal cost of the abilities, with each use he may overwrite one of the stored abilities but does not have to. Can only copy one once per combat."
ability,Cam,Touch-Up,1,,"After taking a picture of something, Cam pulls out a laptop and alters the picture with photoshop, resulting in it changing in real life. The player can suggest effects they want, but the DM ultimately decides what the effects of the alteration are. 78: Saved Assets - Cam can now pull from anything he has edited with Touch-Up before as his use of Touch-Up from here on out. This may incur extra stamina cost. "
ability,Cam,The Memories,5!,,Cam shares one of his photographed abilities with an ally. For the remainder of combat they can use that ability as well. Range 6. Once per Round.
ability,Cam,Window Through Time,3!,,"Something hidden in Cam’s pocket ticks and shudders as he takes a photo, when the polaroid prints out it looks somewhat... special, more like a window than a photo. As an anytime action Cam may manipulate the subject(s) of this photo in a few ways: - Reset anything in the photo to a previous state. (the state they’re in on the photo) This does not affect stamina, but may possibly affect physical changes and transformations. - Freeze anything that was in frame, living beings must roll to attempt to force their way out of the effect. - Reach in and pull something from the photo. It disappears from where it is now, but the consequences or effects from it being used still remain. If this would cause a major paradox, time may get a little messy and correct itself in strange ways. (eg. replacing the object with a similar one from near the original). Photos can be kept for later, and Cam can hold up to 3 before having to replace one."
ability,Cam,GIFted Photoshopper,3!,,"Cam takes a massive amount of pictures in burst mode of something that’s happening now or has just happened, then quickly loads them up into photoshop and makes a GIF, much like Touch-Up this takes effect on reality. This event is now constantly repeating, stuck in a loop for 1d3 rounds. Cannot directly trap people in a GIF. Stronger effects may be dampened, or reduce the amount of rounds."
weapon,Chip,Roulette Revolver,,,"A strange weapon that seems to shoot something different each time it’s fired. 5 range. Each time a hit is successful roll a d6 for effects: 1. A nerf bullet?: 1 damage, 2. Incendiary: 1 burn damage for 1d3 rounds +1d2 rounds burning if target is very flammable, 3. Electric: 3 damage. Bonus +2 damage or a stun if target is/has a lot of metal or liquid on them, 4. Normal revolver shot: 4 damage, 5. Piercing: 3 damage.

weapon,Chip,Baha Blast,,,"A rainbow drill hammer made of pure crystallised chaos. This surprisingly light weapon is capable of shattering chaos itself, it seems. Deals 6 damage at 2 range. When swung, Chip may choose to activate a random weapon effect from the Magishift table (d20). "
weapon,Chip,Stygian Coin,,,"This coin is supposedly cursed by a thousand gamblers who were all executed for absurd luck with the coin. Now it's in your hands, thanks to a lucky card and a pawn shop you know of. It's made of near-indestructible material that shines like gold and gemstones. Has 8 range, and when you attack with it you flip a coin. On a wrong call, the attack only deals 1 damage. On a correct call, it deals 16. Critical failures automatically fail the coin flip and crits automatically succeed, in addition to other crit effects. "
talent,Chip,Cashing Out,,,"Anytime anyone rolls a 10 or 11 he gains two compound coins, these are kept track of in his red bar. Chip can use compound coins to force certain effects depending on how many coins he uses. 1: Up to 2 Wild magic/1 Net Libram Wild Magic Effect or force one roulette revolver shot, 2: Immediate + or - 3 to a roll, 3: Give a roll advantage/disadvantage / Reroll any random effect or table. (this doesn’t create a second instance, it just changes the original) 4: Give a use of All or Nothing a guaranteed success or allow a second coin flip on ALL IN, or +4 to a target's turn, 5: Double any numerical effect or attribute, or Everyone’s rolls next turn (yes, everyone’s) uses a d40 instead of a d20. KEEP IT ROLLIN’!: Natural crit successes and fails now give chip 2 compound coins. "

talent,Chip,Portent,,,"At the start of a session and upon gaining this you roll 2d20. You can spend these die rolls to replace someone else’s roll with them, without needing to roll yourself, so long as you can see what is making the roll. This can be done on enemies too. You cannot bring portent dice between sessions."
passive,Chip,Wild Card,,,"For Chip, rolling a 2 is counted as a crit fail alongside 1s, and 19s are counted as crit successes alongside 20s. For all intents and purposes, these crits are considered natural. "

passive,Unmeiseki Unmeiseki No Mi,Miracle Stone,,,"Your body is now made of Pythos! This means that epithet effects are naturally absorbed within you. Epithet effects now work on you at full effectiveness even on partial successes, however you then hold some of that stone’s energy, which you can hold for as long as you want (or until you lose the fruit). You can spend that charge to attempt an action generally achievable by that instance of the epithet. Your max charges you can hold is equal to 5 for each size category you are, with 1x1 starting at 5."
ability,Chip,All or Nothing,2,,"Chip snaps his fingers and intensifies or de-intensifies an aspect of something (eg. Intensifying the heat of a fire or The flavour of an apple), lowering or raising that aspect as much as possible. "
ability,Chip,ALL IN,0!,,"Chip tries to mess with the attribute of luck for a target, but due to the fickle nature of luck and Chip’s epithet it’s a huge gamble. Force a roll to be either a crit success or fail. The target must pick odds or evens, then a d2 is rolled. Cannot effect nat 1s or 20s. "
ability,Chip,Stacking the Deck,3!,,"Chip points at two allies within sight and focuses, combining their abilities together into one super ability only he can use. Chip may take one ability of both allies and combines the text creating an entirely new ability (the allies still keep their abilities). DM decides the stamina cost. "
ability,Chip,Best of Both!,2,,"Chip combines what he thinks is the best part about two objects, and combines them into one object. He likes the carrying capacity of a messenger bag and the fact that a fridge has food? Messenger Fridge™ it is! Likes the style of a necklace but the fact that this handheld videogame console plays videogames? Cool! Guess he has a tamogachi necklace-sized game console! "
ability,Chip,Re-Roulette,2,,"Chip loves random things, and when someone does something cool he just can’t resist doing it too! Chip focuses the power of his epithet to combine the random nature of something and his roulette revolver to shoot off or use any rollable list he’s seen before."
ability,Chip,Infinite Infrastructure Works,2/X!,,"With lexical building warrant in hand, Chip may form a building or buildings, general infrastructure, or just repair/add to existing things within sight. The scale of this impromptu construction of sorts is dependent on the amount of stamina spent on this ability, and the roll for the ability generally decides it's quality. Additionally, the buildings and their immediate area (usually 1-2 spaces) around them are considered a part of Chips country. One building per round, and one addition or infrastructure per round. "
ability,Unmeiseki Unmeiseki No Mi,Sealed Away,1!,,"Whenever an epithet effect would target you, you may try and completely absorb it. This not only negates the technique, but heals you for half the amount of damage it would’ve done rounding down (up to a max of 5 healing). You also gain an additional charge from that epithet."
ability,Unmeiseki Unmeiseki No Mi,Pandora’s Box,5⛯,,"Release all stored charges within you at once.

ability,Desmond,Crowning Glory,3,,Desmond uses his epithet to enchant a powerful crown. These crowns give it’s wearer a specific ability such as telekinesis or enhanced speed (the power level of this ability is mostly based on the creation roll).

An ability only counts as used (and so can only be stolen) if activated successfully. Twice per combat.

Todd pulls it out and points it at a target spookily for 2 base dread damage at 3 tile range (If he’s unable to pull it out, it rises out of his pocket and floats menacingly). However, the damage (and appearance) of the banana changes the more cursed and/or scary Todd currently is.

Whenever if an 18 is rolled by Todd or an ally he can take a curse and allow it to act as a critical success instead, he may do this once for an ally and once for himself per round. However, the next time Todd? rolls that number it is counted as a critical fail. This effect stacks. At the start of each session or combat he may choose to re-roll the cursed number. "
ability,Todd?,Cursed Clutches,1!,,"Todd focuses the power of his curses out of himself into purple dark energy, then bends it to his will. The more curses he has, the more strength and range this energy has (each 2 = 5 ft + half the strength of an average adult. Base range is 5 ft, and strength of a child). Once per round. "
ability,Todd?,Curse to Curses,1!,,"Todd uses his epithet to convert curse energy into cure energy, energising an ally or himself. He can burn curses to give a target’s roll a buff equal to the amount used. Alternatively he may use this energy to actually heal, every 2 curses burnt equals 1 stamina recovered. 23: Advanced Curse-Curing- Curse to Cures' healing is now 1:1 for allies, and for an additional stamina and a main action may add a +x to all of an allies rolls for a turn. "
ability,Todd?,Images of Power,2,,"Todd has a deep and powerful connection to all cursed images, much to his disdain. It does have its perks though, as he can draw them forth to assist him in various ways. Pick an extremely cursed image, it can then become a summon, an environmental effect, or an attack (anything within reason). Only one summon or effect may be active at one time, he may remove the effect or summon as an unrolled anytime action or a free action on his turn. 16: *Don’t* Touch This- Todd's cursed images are now so cursed, that the first person that touches them gets cursed themselves! 35: I can’t even hold all these images! - There is no longer a limit on how many images of power effects/summons Todd? can have active at a time, but having tooo many may incur an upkeep cost. Additionally, Todd? can spend an additional stamina to combine two cursed images for one effect. "
ability,Todd?,Curse Overflow,3!,,"Sometimes you just need more curses in your life! ...The only exception is of course Todd, but he doesn’t get a choice! Choose a target within Todd’s sight and inflict them with 1d4 curses, or roll 3 curses and choose one. You may target yourself. (The stam cost for this ability does not inflict a curse if it’s being used on yourself) "
ability,Todd?,Masquerade Mastery,3,,"Bonus action. Todd’s been experimenting with his epithet’s weird mask powering properties, and has a pretty solid handle on them along with a few lovingly hand-crafted/decorated masks. When Todd? puts on a mask, he gains a cursed power based on it’s form. Pull out a mask of your choice from the list, or as an anytime roll to pull out a random one. One mask out at a time. Todd? spends some time crafting a mask between sessions, and masks found in the wild can be added to the list permanently, given fitting effects by Todd?'s epithet. "
weapon,Naveed,The Spotlight,,,"Do a finger gun forward, which has a bright shocking beam shoot forward, dealing 3 electric damage at 4 range. Can bounce off reflective surfaces, although there’s no power boost or anything from it."
talent,Naveed,Slander Free,,,"You have a keen sense of what is and isn’t a lie. Whenever someone says something, you can roll to have some kind of innate intuition on whether or not it’s true."
passive,Naveed,Front Page Worthy,,,"Whenever an interesting event happens, you can write it down as a potential primary article for whatever news place you’re working at. At the end of the session you can choose one of those to publish in the next edition. Doing this gives you a newly created upgrade based on whatever the article was! At the end of the session your published article gives you some nice pay, as well as +2 proficiency."
ability,Naveed,Read All About It,3,,"Sometimes you gotta bring the news to the people! Go to any news site and look at some of the top headlines, and cause one of those to just… happen on the field! This can be by new things suddenly entering and enacting the event(s) or having the current characters around do so."
ability,Naveed,You Won't Believe,1,,"Sometimes you just gotta tickle your audience a little to get them intrigued. Create a clickbait title like “5 Reasons Why Walking Off Cliffs Is Healthy For You (Number 2 Will Shock You)”, and an enemy will be intrigued and drawn into doing it!"
ability,Naveed,In a Flash,1!,,"Naveed dissolves into pure energy and travels up to 5 spaces. This can be used to dodge attacks, or enter technology to change how they act or download some juicy details."
ability,Naveed,Sensational Spin,1!,,"You can attempt to add a “spin” to the current situation much like you might spin an event in the news to be interpreted in certain ways. With this you can try and manipulate an event to be more beneficial, or something else. Once per round."
ability,Naveed,Live Broadcast,1,,"When an event that you’d normally record with your passive happens, you can instead not write it down for the next big headline and instead publish a small article about it RIGHT NOW! This lets you basically make a smaller and weaker version of the upgrade your passive would make to use on your immediate next turn after the event happened, but you don’t get to keep it. Luckily a lot of interesting things tend to happen around here so you’ll be in no shortage of stories! Once per round."
weapon,Jane Rose,Everything?,,,"Jane is capable of using anything effectively as a weapon, somehow. Generate a random item to start combat (or RP) with as a """"weapon"""", so long as it isn't a traditional weapon it gains a +3 to all attack rolls using it. Additionally, this boost is given to any actions involving the use of these items, but they must be within her possession. Range and damage depends on what the item is, but this can change depending on how it’s used. If Jane is left without a “weapon”, she may pull out or “find” another random item as a free action on her turn. 34: Extra Prepared: Jane starts with an additional random item. She may now roll to pull another out if she has less than two instead of one. "
weapon,Jane Rose,Ol' Unpredictable,,,"Jane’s backup gun from her past, it’s been modified to the point of being near unrecognisable from a normal gun, and is able to shoot anything that can fit in it’s expanded custom magazine (it’s about the size of a brick). 2 damage, 5 range when shooting bullets, damage when firing objects is determined by the object and how the shot is flavoured. Various objects can be attached onto Ol' Unpredictable as an anytime action to give it small bonuses for the rest of the session. The bonuses are small, sometimes odd and specific, and need to be really weird objects that wouldn't usually work being attached to a gun. "
weapon,Jane Rose,Break Style,,,"Using the martial arts etched into her mind and body through training when she was young, Jane attempts to disarm an opponent and attack them with their own weapon, or just break it. Jane may use items she has on her or the surrounding environment for extra damage or effects (if items are used, this gains the +3 boost). Due to her epithet, extensive training in how to locate and manipulate the best breaking point on any given thing and intense body hardening methods, Jane can break almost anything without issue. Combos with Breakout!. "
talent,Jane Rose,Indomitable Will,,,"Jane can only receive a maximum of 5 damage per turn (not counting stamina costs), any over that limit will be dealt at the end of her next turn recurring until all damage is received. Healing removes imminent damage before replenishing current stamina. "
talent,Jane Rose,Willpower Engine,,,"In addition to making the impossible possible, Jane’s epithet passively reacts to her willpower and spirit. Whenever the current situation gets more dire, Jane takes a worrying amount of damage, or receives a debilitating effect she adds a point or points (up to the GM’s discretion) to her red stat: Will. In general, the more intense and/or dooming a development is, the more points that are awarded. Will can be expended to cause various effects or increase the potency of her abilities and attacks: (?) - give or gain stamina for each point of Will expended, Increase the potency of any ability or attack based on the amount spent, (1) - +2 to a roll, gain a random item as a swift action (once per turn), (2) - Give or force a re-roll, shrug off a status effect, pull out an item of your choice as a swift action (3) - give Advantage/Disadvantage, attempt a counterattack or dodge, gain an extra movement action (4) - use an ability as an anytime, allow an action to combo on 11+ (if used again, it then continues to combo with +3 to the required roll, until it fails or it is used 5 times)- must be used and stated before rolling, (5) - Force a crit success, gain another action on your turn (10) - Feel the bloodlust, give in to your killer’s instincts. Jane puts aside her vows for the sake of survival. Become the Rose of Death. "
talent,Jane Rose,Break Style: Quick Break,,,"If an enemy attacks Jane with a melee weapon she can counter-roll, if she rolls higher she takes no damage and may immediately attempt a counter-attack using Break Style. If the roll is a tie no one takes the damage. "
passive,Jane Rose,Improbability Overdrive,,,"As a result of her sheer determination and epithet, Jane only gets more unstoppable the more she’s pushed into a corner. If the GM says or implies *anything* to the effect of ""this will be hard to succeed"", Jane's rolls doing said thing gains advantage or some large kind of roll boost, up to guaranteeing a critical success- in extreme cases. Additionally, thanks to the influence of Jane's epithet, logical inconsistencies or things that would halt Jane or allies in her immediate area are sometimes bypassed by strange or incredibly unlikely coincidences and occurrences. The GM may ask for a roll when such events would occur, if they wish. "
passive,Jane Rose,Breakout!,,,"If something is powerful enough to break an object, either by Jane or on her person, she can have it break apart perfectly/just how she'd want it. Like slamming a table over someone's head, breaking it apart to the main part and having a table leg break off for a new temporary weapon. If the action was small enough, Jane can continue to Action-Movie-Combo with other small actions until she fails a roll. Great Days - The first time Breakdown is used intentionally by Jane on her turn, it counts as a free action. This can, naturally, combo into other actions. Small, simplistic actions can also count as a free action from this passive. "
ability,Jane Rose,Quick Fix-Up,1,,"Jane takes an object or object(s), and macgyvers them into something that could feasibly be created or is related to it. This can also cause an effect, if explained well enough. Jane's weapon roll boost applies. "
ability,Jane Rose,Breaking out the ... Gun,2,,"Jane slowly reaches into her jacket and pulls out a gun, holding it out menacingly in front of her before… just throwing it! Jane calculates the perfect angle and power that would be required to break, bounce, or shatter something, and cause it or a byproduct of the throw to ricochet in such a way that it comes flying right into Jane’s waiting hands, which she may then immediately perform an attack or action with. The gun left behind has 4 range 2 damage, but who cares about that thing? "
ability,Jane Rose,But Little Did You Know!,2!,,"Jane pulls out an object that, seemingly, has absolutely zero relevance to the situation. However, Jane Jonothan Joestar's up an explanation as to exactly how this is going to save her in this exact moment. For example, taking out a large slab of steak in response to a large cutting attack and blocking with it. When they cut through, the opponent would assume that they cut through Jane, and therefore retract their blade. Yet there she is, perfectly fine. Note that the object must have zero relevance to the situation at hand. (Like you can't be at a beach and pull out a coconut. It must be seemingly completely unrelated.) On higher rolls, Jane can keep the object."
ability,Jane Rose,Rule of Cool,1!,,"It’s a well known fact that a hitman’s badassery and effectiveness are intertwined at a spiritual level, being cool just makes you better at things! Using her epithet, Jane gives the roll for an action +1. If the roll is deemed weird, unconventional, or cool, the roll gets +5 instead. Once per round. "
ability,Jane Rose,Chaos Theory,X!,,"Sometimes reality can be a little indecisive, Jane’s epithet just gives it the push it needs. Jane wills her epithet outwards, causing an extremely improbable event or sequence of events as the world rube-goldberg chain reactions to cause a desired effect. If this event is more realistic the cost may be reduced slightly, and if the sequence of events is explained out, it may get a boost in effectiveness. Cost is determined by severity, but you may state how much you’re paying first, if desired."
weapon,Ryne,Baseball Bat,,,"She used to use it in her little league games, but now she just beats people up during her part time job. Deals 5 damage at 1 range. [13 Prof] Objects you baseball bat at targets now deal an additional +1 damage from what they would normally do. [27 Prof] HOMERUN!!! - Ryne’s basic weapon gains +3 critical hit range. On a crit, the target suffers knockback equal to the damage the bat is dealing."
talent,Ryne,Wanna See a Dead Body?,,,"In her backpack Ryne can pull out random skulls, raven feathers, weird occult components and shit like that. She can even pull out dark books on arcane knowledge. [20 Prof] Crazy Collection - Whenever pulling out items from her backpack, she can choose to have the object’s special effect be that it is inflicted with a curse from Todd?’s curse list. The first person who comes in contact with the item gets inflicted with it, or alternatively the item can have the curse itself and not spread it to those they touch. Ryne can use some special batting gloves to avoid getting the effect herself while touching them."
talent,Ryne,Special Delivery,,,"As Imperito’s delivery and errand girl, she is able to move with double her movement speed if it’s to deliver an item to an ally."
passive,Ryne,Purification in Progress,,,"Ryne’s epithet reveals all of the human stresses, anxieties, and vices that people think of and experience, showing them as ghostly apparitions coming from the minds of those that have them. Ryne can use this to try and determine things about the minds of her enemies, and can attack them with her basic attack in order to try and cause mental psychic damage to their enemy, weakening that part of their mind. This doesn’t cure them of the problems, in fact it makes them much worse before eventually killing that part of a person’s psyche if attacked too much, stripping them of some of their humanity. Have fun!"
ability,Ryne,Refinery Things in Life,3,,"Ryne takes an object and “refines” it into a different form of itself. Think of this as running an item through SCP-914. There are five settings: Rough, Course, 1:1, Fine, and Very Fine. 1:1 turns the object into a different but roughly equivalent item in terms of ideas and physical structure. The lower settings like Rough begin to break things into components and remove ideas, while higher settings like Fine add features and complexity while expanding the ideas. Look at examples from the test logs of the page for a better idea of the applications. Ryne has some level of manipulation over the end outcome, but the GM ultimately gets to decide what the end result is, and the lower the roll the further away from the intended output Ryne gets. Due to her personal beliefs, she refuses to use it on living creatures."
ability,Ryne,True Self Sabotage,1,,"Ryne seemingly takes control of a shadowy apparition of a target she sees, letting her weaponize the monstrosity against the target to tear them apart, afflicting them with an effect based off of the inner demon that’s been controlled."
ability,Ryne,Round and Round,3!,,"Ryne refines the shape of an effect into the perfect form: a circle. This turns an effect into an area of effect, specifically a circle with a 1 range radius. However, it doesn’t affect the center and instead hits just the border of its circle. Once per round.[16 Prof] Round and Round can now make abilities into circle ranges of 1-2 range radiuses."
ability,Ryne,Placeholder Object,3,,"With a snap Ryne is able to strip an adjacent item of its defining traits, turning it into a more amorphous white orb which has seemingly no mass and doesn’t interact with gravity. This item can only be moved around by Ryne, others simply passing through it. This stores the “identity” of the purified item for Ryne to later apply to another item. If done on another one of these white orb object templates, the original item is recreated. If put on another item, then the two ideas that create the item are compositely mixed together into the logical composite of both items."
weapon,Rouge,Void-Touched Shadow River,,,"Rogue flashily holds his hand out in front of him and shoots a blast of dark liquid at a target. It’s definitely NOT INK, OK? 3 damage 6 range. 22: +1 range.  "
weapon,Rouge,Oragami Killer,,,"A surprisingly tough black oragami scythe. Rogue thinks it’s really cool. 5 damage melee range. Due to being steeped in shadow realm energy, Oragami Killer can easily slice through stone and the like. "
talent,Rouge,A Corrupted Paper Doll,,,"Rogue is a Cam clone, an epithet creation made of paper and ink. This means he is especially weak to the typical weaknesses of paper. However after being possessed by W shadowrealm energy flows through his veins, allowing him to resist or ignore shadow-related effects, among other things. 32: Odious Black Shadow Liquid - Rogue can now, through sheer over-exposure, drink coffee. Physics be damned. He needs it man! Just as long as he calls it “Liquid Shadowfuel” or whatever to hold back the fear."
talent,Rouge,Wicked Bluster (Airmbrella),,,"What at first glance seems to be some sort of walking stick is actually an upside umbrella with three small holes at the base that have a flow of air pushing out from them when the correct mechanism is pressed. It is specifically designed to blow harder in the presence of water/any liquid the user specifies entering within 5 feet of it (as it is an umbrella). You may passively push any water that would be sent near you away while this is active but there are limits depending on the body of water’s size. Additionally, it can be used to create a massive pulse of wind once per combat. What you do with this can change but if just using it on someone adjacent to you to attack it does 4 damage and 7 knockback."
passive,Rouge,It’s a Rorschach Reality,,,"Rogue’s very inky blood is infused with the power of the shadow realm god W. Thanks to this he inherited a small amount of his strange reality-warping power -with the catch that he must use ink as a medium. When Rogue wills it, a 5ft aura of strange shadowy ink blots float in the air around him. As a bonus action Rogue can unleash the shadowrealm power to either form solid half-ink half-shadow constructions from or morph anything within his aura in some shape or form. Again as a bonus or full action, once something has been marked or has ink on it he can manipulate it as if it were inside his Rorschach aura, but the further it is away from him the harder it is to perform. "
passive,Rouge,Shadow and Mirrors,,,"The Shadowrealm and its energies are directly tied to manipulation and illusion. Partially to fuel this fact, and partially as an act of petty rebellion against his creator, Rogue gains +1 proficiency or +1 stamina whenever he makes someone else believe a myth/legend or creates a fun mystery. Of course Rogue isn’t malicious about this, he’s just angsty and is pulling a light-hearted trick to ease the existential pain. Only triggers once per trick, and future tricks cannot be done on the same people as previous ones to trigger it again."
passive,Hakai Hakai No Mi,Destruction Proof ,,,"You are immune to instant kill effects and effects that would “erase” you from existence, even momentarily."
passive,Hakai Hakai No Mi,Clear Body,,,Status effects that passively require rolls to clear are now cleared automatically whenever you would’ve performed the roll. Status effects that you can’t clear passively with rolls now let you roll once at the start of your turns to try and clear it from you.
ability,Rouge,Shadow Clone: Darkplex,3,,"Though he tried it in the past (to varying levels of success), Rogue has sworn off of making the usual clones. Instead, he’s found a waayy cooler, darker way of making clones! Rogue pulls out a piece of blank film and creates an otherworldly glowing orb behind himself using shadowrealm power, casting a shadow through it. This shadow comes to life on the surface it is cast on with base 3 stamina, 5 movement, and both of Rogue’s basic attacks. Because the clone is created from a shadow, he may do things such as jump, which would give the clone flight, or squat to make them shorter. Essentially, the shadow clones get features/abilities based on their form. 28: Shadow Clones may now use Malicious Modification. 36: Once per combat Rogue can create two shadow clones at once with Shadow Clone: Darkplex."
ability,Rouge,Silhouette Shot ,2,,"Rogue looks at his surroundings and takes a picture of it in a pure black and pure white. This leaves nothing but the raw silhouettes of the subjects, which Rogue can construe in any which way he wants. Rogue can then peel the silhouette off the photo and either apply it like a rorschach blob anywhere within his passive to apply effects related to the silhouette/create ink constructs in the shape of the silhouette, or alternatively he can combine the silhouette with one of his shadow clones to turn them into the subject of the picture."
ability,Rouge,Malicious Modification,1,,"Though he can’t exactly photoshop reality yet, Rogue has figured out that with some creative thinking, his phone’s cheap camera, and the Shadowshop™ app he can shift the perspective on an object making it larger, smaller, or even combining multiple objects. Can also be used on himself to essentially teleport. "
ability,Rouge,Photographic Piracy,1!,,"Rogue attempts to take a photo of something with his eyes, but since he’s always wearing an eyepatch it only copies half of it. This can be used to save two halves of any abilities and stick them together into one (the half abilities can be used on their own), or print out a papery version of half an object, effect, etc. (which can also be saved and created as one stuck together object). Not once per round. Once per instance of an effect. 25: Photo Negative - When Rogue uses Photographic Piracy, he can have one or both halves be “negatives” of the original, holding inverted effects of the originals. "
ability,Rouge,Hollow Vagabond (With a Shadowy Past),0⛯,,"The Shadowrealm’s powers naturally lend themselves to possession, and since Rogue’s already been possessed once by one of the strongest beings there is he has quite a large vacant spot in his body. As a bonus action Rogue is temporarily able to grant access to his own body for one of his allies, even if they are knocked out. This allows that person to act as Rogue, using his kit, during what would’ve been their turn. Rogue still keeps his own turn however, as they’re “sharing” his body this time. Both Rogue and the other person can also use the possesser’s abilities, but weakened to be more paper-y and flimsy. Either party can dispel this possession as a free action. Once per combat."
ability,Hakai Hakai No Mi,Matter Obliteration,3,,"Put your hand forwards towards an adjacent non-sapient, non-sentient object. That object is deleted from existence. This prevents regenerative effects, but can’t stop people from creating new instances of the item. When used on another person’s equipment, they get a free counter roll. (some indestructible items like legendary blades are immune to this)"
ability,Hakai Hakai No Mi,Torment of Hailfire,X,,"Fire out an array of small spheres of pure destructive energy. These attacks destroy nonliving, non-sentient matter instantaneously on contact. They deal 3 damage each and can travel up to 20 range away. You can send them up into the air to rain down on enemies to bypass obstacles in the way. X caps at 1/10th your proficiency rounding down (minimum of 1). If you fail this roll, you must still pay the full cost of X."
weapon,Altis,Volatile Vial,,,"Altis throws a vial of volatile liquid infused with candescent realm energy. Deals 4 light damage at 4 range, on especially high rolls has a small area of effect. Whatever is hit glows for a short time. 35: Getting back in the groove: +1 damage. "
weapon,Altis,Chained Fists,,,"3 damage 1 range, deals bonus damage to targets in Altis's bound powers list. Fists bound in epithet chains, Altis used this fighting style a lot in his prime, when not using his blade. Though his strength was decimated, the skills and techniques he built up remain. When used against a chained enemy Altis rolls advantage."
talent,Altis,Master Mixer,,,"Altis is a master alchemist, and as such can create various potions on the fly with ease (he also always carries basic potion components with him). Essence Infusion can be used to create any standard RPG potion such as strength, speed, health, etc."
talent,Altis,Philosopher’s Pocket Watch,,,"Altis always keeps his special pocket watch built with a small philosopher's stone in it’s centre on his person at all times. With this, he can purify anything. This could mean cleaning dirty water, purging poisons, or removing impurities in materials such as metals. This can be used on living things. "
talent,Altis,Symbiotic Synergy,,,"Whenever Altis channels A’s power into one of his attacks or abilities, it gains a +3 to it’s roll. Whenever Altis rolls a nat 20 his synchronisation with A hits an all time high, giving him complete access to her sheet for a turn. "
talent,Altis,|Corruption Arc|,,,Whenever Altis would do an action that would be considered cruel or against his nature as a hero he gains a stacking plus 1 to rolls for each genuinely cruel action he commits. These actions can’t be as simple as “I trip someone” or “I treat people annoyingly.” These actions actually have to be genuinely cruel and evil actions that Altis is making a conscious decision to do. Caps at a total of +10. These do not go away.
passive,Altis,ᛘᚮᛆᛋᚱᛆᚵ,,,"While ᛘᚮᛆᛋᚱᛆᚵ (or “A”, as Altis calls them) has come to a begrudging understanding that they have to work together with Altis, they sure aren’t happy about it. Any time Altis crit fails, is knocked unconscious/put to sleep, or something happens that would particularly piss “A” off,  “A” may roll to manifest around or temporarily possess (in the case of unconsciousness) Altis and enjoy a few moments of freedom. For the next round “A” is unchained and can use her power as she pleases. This may or may not benefit or hinder Altis and his allies. 27: Power ‘A’ Plenty - Whenever Altis rolls a nat 20 his synchronisation with A hits an all time high, giving him complete access to her abilities for a turn. (Much to her disgust) Additionally, he gets a +3 to channelling her in his abilities. 60: A Team To Surpass Gods - “A” may manifest within 6 spaces of Altis as an unrolled anytime action, and stay out as long as she pleases -so long as Altis has no objections. One third of the damage “A” takes goes to Altis, otherwise her stamina is counted as Altis’s. Additionally, Altis has full access to “A”’s kit while channelling her (the only exception being anytimes), and “A” has full access to Altis’s kit at all times. "
passive,Altis,Pass the Power,,,"When Altis utilises a weakness of an enemy to deal a powerful blow or skilfully knocks an enemy down he gains a boost of power. Altis can use this boost to take another action at slightly greater effectiveness immediately, or he may “pass” it to an ally, giving them the action instead. If the ally taking the turn meets the conditions to gain a pass, they may immediately use or pass another turn (this action continues to get stronger). A pass can only be used by an individual twice per round. "

passive,Fuwa Fuwa No Mi,My Heaven,,,"You can spend unspent movement as free actions on your turn, to move anything that you have floating with your devil fruit that number of spaces. This translates regardless of size, and has no saving throw when used on enemies."
ability,Altis,Binding Chain,1!,,"Altis’s signature ability from his prime, though it’s a mere shadow of what it once was. Altis lashes out at something with an ethereal chain restricting someone, pulling something to himself, or binding multiple things together. 8 (40ft) range, and those bound by the chains must roll to break out of them. For an extra stamina, chains used for restriction may seal off epithets or magic-reliant abilities and effects until broken. Sealing someone does not end currently active effects originating from them, but it may dampen their effectiveness temporarily. "
ability,Altis,Essence Infusion,2,,"Altis uses an alchemical ritual to draw essence from people or objects around him, then infuse it into a potion. Pick up to 2 characters or objects within 5 spaces of Altis and create a potion with effects based on their abilities/properties. Altis can instead use objects or ingredients he has on hand and mix them physically, if done like this he gets a +3. Throwing/drinking a potion is a free action and may be done right after using this ability. "
ability,Altis,Matter Swap,1!,,"Using the power of ᛘᚮᛆᛋᚱᛆᚵ, Altis changes the state of matter of an object (cannot affect sentient living things). Can also transmute materials and objects to less/more valuable or similar versions. "
ability,Altis,Shackles of Symbiosis,2,,"By attaching two things together at up to 8 spaces away with his epithet chains, Altis may temporarily bind them together at a fundamental level. Much like how he and A’s life forces are practically one, so too are the newly bound targets. All damage, healing, and effects are shared between shackled targets, this does not include stamina costs. By paying an extra 2 stamina Altis can make the damage sharing one-way. Altis may choose to make chains intangible or physical, regardless of form their durability is the same and he may dismiss them at will. "
ability,Altis,|Shackles of Power|,2,,Altis focuses on a bound power within him and shoots out white epithetical chains at a target within 8 spaces. The chains wrap around the target infusing them with a bound power of Altis’s choice. This gives the target similar benefits (and downsides) to his passive as not allowing Altis to access the bound power while the chain is up. The chain is removed if the target walks out of this abilities range or it can be removed with a movement action. Altis can have multiple chains up at once but the cost increases by 1 for each chain on the field. Can be used as a bonus action on Altis’ turn. 
ability,Altis,|Entropy|,3,,"A new ability that Altis has been experimenting with as of recently. With his newfound power, he’s discovered that it seems to be easier to manipulate his epithet to the point he can manipulate the actual bonds that bind his bound powers. He’s been able to manipulate it to the point where he’s able to put stress on bound powers putting them into overdrive known as an entropic state. While the bound power is in this state Altis receives a not small permanent buff for the rest of the combat that relates to the bound power. He can keep the buff going after a combat or RP scenario has ended at a cost of 1 stamina upkeep at the end of each combat and RP scenario. The stamina lost by this upkeep is not regenerated at the end of combats.This can be as simple as a damage boost to something unique like +5 movement while trying to defend allies, it just has to be dependent on the bound power. The bound power that is in the entropic state becomes unable to be used while it is in this state. When the session ends or when altis dismisses the power is unable to be used in combats equal to the number of combats that the buff was used in plus 1. Altis cannot put ᛘᚮᛆᛋᚱᛆᚵ, or any of the bound powers gathered through |Benefits| into an entropic state. If Altis would fail while using this ability the action does not fail but the cost increases by one for the failed roll. If Altis crit fails the cost is increased by 1 again but he does not fail. Twice per session. "
ability,Fuwa Fuwa No Mi,Zero G,0!,,"By touching an adjacent thing, it begins to float upwards in the air. This is regardless of size, but “up” is defined relative to the closest massive source of gravity (in most cases the Earth). You can at any time tell these items to either stay in their current elevation or begin floating upwards or downwards at a brisk pace. This can be used as a bonus action, and as an anytime action once per round."
ability,Fuwa Fuwa No Mi,Fly Me To The Moon,3⛯,,"Once per combat, you may cause a pulse of your devil fruit power to cover the entire arena. This causes the entire thing to begin moving upwards. Every turn causes it to raise 10 ft into the air. You may as a free action on your turn disable the floating, causing the entire arena to fall. This will likely destroy most if not all terrain, and deal significant fall damage and knock prone everyone who can’t fly, likely 1 damage per 10 ft fallen."
weapon,Discus,Junk Cannon,,,"A weapon constructs somewhere on Discus (usually in his hands) and it starts firing all the random junk he’s been cleaning up at a target, completely undoing all his hard work. Fire up to 3 objects from the Junk Zone, damage and range is dependent on the objects. Alternatively, fire an attack that was sucked up into the Junk Space, at the same effectiveness. "
weapon,Discus,Big Scary Data Claw,,,"After cleaning up so many data kobolds, Discus has a LOT of spare lizard data. By pooling all of it into one spot he can create a big data claw and clumsily swipe to usually devastating effect. 5 damage melee, and easily slashes through objects and obstacles. Only usable in humanoid form. "
weapon,Discus,Who Duct-Taped Knives to the Roomba Again?!,,,"Discus combines his movement and action, zooming by and/or into an enemy with knives precariously taped to him. Deals 1 damage to targets passed for each square they were passed by. Only usable in roomba form. "
weapon,Discus,Glitter Cannon,,,"Discus has sucked up an ungodly amount of glitter in his brief life, and it's ...just kinda sitting around in the Junk Space waiting to be used! Generate a sparkly cannon and fire off a bomb at a target within 5 range for 2 damage. Targets hit with the glitter are easier to attack, and thus others attacking them gain a +2. Additionally, Discus can grind up things in the Junk Space to add extra effect to this weapon."
talent,Discus,FUCK! :>,,,"An old habit from his first few days of rogue sentience, Discus can’t help but exclaim in surprise whenever he unintentionally runs into an object or the like (this is activated upon being forcefully slammed into something). Whenever he does this he may regain 1 stamina."
talent,Discus,Chaos Card: 30!,,,You now permanently roll a d30 instead of a d20. It scales off the d20 scale but you only gain proficiency from a natural 20. 
passive,Discus,RoombAI,,,"Discus can swap as a free action on his turn from the base Roomba form to the humanoid form at will. Additionally, Discus can ""eat"" anything, which is then stored in the Junk Space: a seemingly digital pocket dimension that exists simultaneously within Discus and the DBAtabase “janitor closet” simultaneously. (Living things within the Junk Space are in complete stasis, unaging or decaying, as they are converted to raw data and back again when released) - While in roomba form Discus may roll to automatically suck up any area of effect hazards and spills he moves over (these are counted as being put into the Junk Space), is quite small and thus able to fit in many tight spaces, and an ally can ride on them for free when he uses his move action -though this decreases his movement depending on the rider’s build (S:-0, A:-1, H:-2). (Ridbi upgrade: All movement negatives are reduced by 1) - While in the amalgamated humanoid form Discus may take or form features from anything he has stored in his Junk Space as a bonus action on his turn (for this purpose, “a Korima” is always considered to be stored within the junk space), and can also as a bonus action attach/assimilate or connect/communicate with almost any technology within touch, even if it really shouldn’t be able to communicate back. "
passive,Discus,Roombas Never Die! ...Wait,,,"It’d be a real hassle to create a whole new roomba every time it got destroyed, so all of Discus’s data is backed up in the metaphorical janitor's closet of the DBAtabase. Additionally, since Discus is a simple construct he’s very easy to recreate quickly. After being completely destroyed, he spends a round reforming at an area of his choosing within 6 spaces of the space he was destroyed after being rebooted and reformed. After being reformed, regain 1d6 stamina. Discus completely retains all memories and everything from his death with no physical repercussions, so long as his data remains backed up. "
passive,Discus,Clean Time!,,,"Discus is a multi-purpose cleaning bot, and as such, is programmed with all the cleaning products under the sun. As a bonus action on his turn, he may form a cleaning product of some kind. In his humanoid form he can form them into his body as if they were in the Junk Space, and in his roomba form he can leave a trail of some kind of cleaning-related liquid as he moves as a rolled free action. "
ability,Discus,Vrrrrrrrrrr,1!,,"Suck up a nearby object or attack, which is then converted to data and added to the Junk Space. When in roomba form Discus can disengage his lock-in mechanism and be pulled to larger or heavier objects instead, and in humanoid form he can instead blow the air out, blasting the target away. Once per round. "
ability,Discus,Caution! Data Leak! ,3,,"Attention! There is a mess!!! Thank you for your attention! Ribbons of code flow out of Discus and form into a caution sign up to 8 spaces away with a strange warning on it as they proclaim the area is in dire need of cleaning. Create a specific warning sign, which causes an effect of some kind relating to the warning. "
ability,Discus,Collection Zone,3!,,"Oh no! There’s too much mess for Discus to clean up just running around on his own... Good thing he’s able to project an opening to the Junk Space so he can just scoop everything up! Create a 2x2 space within 6 spaces, all items within the area can be sucked within the Junk Space immediately, any items within the Junk Space can be ejected as a 0 cost once per round anytime. Living things can be sucked into the Junk Space, but they get a roll to escape this, and if they are sucked they can attempt to force their way out every round unless they are unconscious (in which they're stuck). The Collection Zone lasts 1 round, but Discus may pay 1 stamina at the start of his turn to keep it active, up to 3 rounds total. "
ability,Discus,Recycling is Important,3⛯,,"Discus is a very good little cleaner, and knows the importance of recycling. By salvaging the messed up code leftover from all of his cleaning Discus sits down and creates a unique ability. Make an ability based on any number of things from the Junk Zone (this removes them). At the start of combat or RP, Discus chooses one of these abilities to use, he may only pick one and cannot change it until the next. Once per session."
weapon,Buckscape,Bark and Bite,,,"Buckscape is a pretty old pooch, so his attacking prowess ain’t what it used to be. Fortunately, he has his old pal Noma granting him minor bouts of demonic strength, allowing Buckscape to lift things far easier when using this basic attack. 4 Damage 1 Range"
talent,Buckscape,Jolly Green Dog,,,"Buckscape loves frozen peas! If he eats them, however, while they may heal him greatly in the moment, they also remove one max stamina because Buckscape is slowly dying and is also allergic to frozen peas."
passive,Buckscape,Pulling from the Pound,,,"Buckscape is a magnet for spirits, dragging them across planes into a new doggy home. Most of these spirits use Buckscape as a means of transportation, but while they’re here, they feel like fuckin around a bit. At the start of combat, Buckscape’s player contacts two random people on their Discord Friend List and asks one for a passive and one for an ability. The new passive replaces this one for the rest of combat, while the new ability replaces “A Ghost’s Best Friend”. After this has been done, the two contacted people act as ghosts that have joined Buckscape’s ever growing collection, and can assist Buckscape’s player in any sort of metagaming ways they see fit. (NOTE) For maximum stupidity, the two contacts should not be told each other’s identities until after the passive and ability have been made."
passive,Buckscape,The Devil’s Pea-ttuce,,,"On Buckscape’s turn, he can give into temptation and call to one of the many Hells, a green aura leaking out of him. He must roll, and if he manages to roll high enough (decided by GM), a menacing, frozen pea is spawned within Buckscape’s Movement Speed, emanating a similar green aura. If it is spawned adjacent to a unit that isn’t demonic in nature, they take 1 damage, and if Buckscape stands adjacent to it, he gains a +1 to his rolls. Or he can just eat it. However, if Buckscape is adjacent to 2 or more frozen peas, he may need to make checks, lest his gluttony gets the better of him and he chows down on the spot."
ability,Buckscape,A Ghost’s Best Friend,?,,"Buckscape, willingly or not, is a great companion to the many ghosts living inside of him. As such, he is fantastic at carrying out their horrific desires. This ability is replaced by whatever ability is created via “Pulling from the Pound” while in combat."
ability,Buckscape,"Alright Boy, Fetch!!",2!,,"Buckscape can smell the bones of a unit within 3 spaces of it. Upon taking this sniff, a demon is called from the ground, grabbing the unit by said bone and throwing them somewhere within 3 spaces. As soon as the throw occurs, Buckscape immediately bolts over to the unit, biting the bone and dealing 3-5 damage in the process. Any units Buckscape passes through while doing this take 1-2 damage. Once per round."
ability,Buckscape,Howl of the Damned,X,,"Buckscape produces a ghastly howl, sealing the pact. Noma then uses their demonic powers to create some horrible event that shall devastate the battlefield...but only later. The amount of stamina pumped into this ability not only dictates the event’s scope, but each stamina point used also dictates the amount of rounds until this event occurs. Because Noma’s the one doing this, it always has some kind of hellish twist or aesthetic to it. [15 prof] The Day of Reckoning - Howl of the Damned’s Round Timer no longer directly correlates to its Stamina Cost. In fact, Buckscape can have the horrible event caused by it occur immediately!...However, it will be fairly small in terms of scope comparatively. Now, Buckscape is able to set the amount of rounds until the effect occurs himself, with greater wait times yielding greater rewards."
ability,Buckscape,Dog Eats _ in 0 seconds,3,,"Buckscape's neck stretches out up to 5 spaces as they go to eat something whole. His head will enlarge to grotesque degrees to fulfil this end. For numerous small things, he may eat as many things adjacent to or on a 5-space line(the line being his range) as he wants but if it's only one big thing he goes in and just EATS it, dealing around 7-10 damage and swallowing it. Whatever it is, if it even can, must make rolls to resist, but either way Buckscape gets a buff or new thing based on what he ate which usually lasts until the end of combat but could last longer. Buckscape can eat ANYTHING with this. "
weapon,Jericho,Touch of Ruin,,,"Jericho unwraps the bandages on her hand before thrusting it savagely towards her target. 2 Damage 1 Range. Upon contact, the area she grasps cracks and fades in colour as their existence is slowly claimed by her epithet. If successful, it counts as making contact. Crits count as two touches. "
weapon,Jericho,Piercing Claw ,,,"Jericho forms a claw of pure epithet energy and dashes towards a target at lightning-fast speeds, striking at them in such a way as to break past their defences. Inflicts her passive’s contact effects which pierce DR, and cannot be stopped through block, dodge, or intangibility anytimes due to a combination of practiced technique and raw epithet enhancement. Additionally, Jericho may move 1 space when using this attack, allowing her to move from a space away into melee range or reposition. Crits double the damage dealt from the passive instead of this weapon. "
talent,Jericho,Spare Pair,,,"Things can get pretty wild in combat, and though her bandages are extra tough stuff happens. Therefore Jericho always makes sure to keep a bunch of extra bandages, gloves, and other random assorted cover-up clothing on her at all times. She may pull out any of this stuff anytime she wishes on her turn as a free action, it can be anything so long as it’s relevant. "
talent,Jericho,Extreme Grade Gas Mask,,,"Jericho not only doesn’t suffer ill effects from inhaled gases, particles, poisons, venoms, or toxins, but she in fact benefits from them by having their negative effects inverted. For example, a simple damaging poison would instead heal her. This does not apply to poisons she is already immune to."
talent,Jericho,Feed The Beast,,,"Jericho gains a red stat: Hunger. Whenever Jericho fails a roll, is utterly avoided, or is inflicted with a negative status she gains +1 Hunger. Hunger can be spent to take 1 movement out of turn, give a roll a +1 (these can be stacked), or generically increase the effectiveness of an ability or action. Jericho may use increments of 6 Hunger to enter a “Hunter Mode”, lasting a round per 6 used. While in “Hunter Mode” Jericho gains 1.5x damage, movement, and her epithet flares up making all her epithet-related abilities generally more effective. If 18 or more Hunger is spent to enter ""Hunter Mode"", The Calamitous Cursed Beast’s effective range extends out from her skin, making it a 5ft aura for the duration."
talent,Jericho,Cat-like Reflexes,,,"Jericho is very flexible and swift, as such she can easily perform minor feats of acrobatics, dexterity, or incredible flexibility as a free action on her turn. If performed as an action or movement, this rolls with advantage. "
passive,Jericho,Endless Hunger ,,,"Jericho’s epithet constantly drives her to take, and cannot be turned off. Usually this involves having an intense desire to steal powerful items, abilities, and a primal self-preservation instinct that makes her fight the urge to drain anything nearby when heavily injured. Basically, she feels a strong pull to especially powerful things. She rolls with a -3 when resisting effects that play specifically to this issue. "
ability,Jericho,Baneful Binds,1!,,"After spending so long wrapped in bandages, Jericho’s epithet has completely assimilated them. Jericho conjures a mass of extremely durable bandages from her body and manipulates them as she sees fit within 6 spaces. "
ability,Jericho,Claws of Avarice,3,,"Letting herself go for a moment, Jericho forms large malicious claws of warped power and slashes across two connected spaces in a line for 5 damage, up to 3 spaces away. Jericho may steal something from those hit, even abstract things, as her epithet rips it away from them and inflicts a touch (this does not deal contact damage). If Jericho chooses, she can reduce the range and radius to one and instead deal 8 damage, may substitute the steal for an extra effect based on how she utilises the claw, and inflicts 2 “touches” for the purposes of her passive. If Jericho chooses not to steal stamina, the contact effect does not include stamina drain. "
ability,Jericho,Avatar of Greed,1!,,"Jericho closes her palm as if she’s gripping the air as she steals “something” within sight. If it’s a physical object she must be able to fit it within her hand, otherwise she must expend an additional stamina per each size category the object fits (base is small, medium is +1, large +2, etc.). This can also be abstract things such as someone’s “intent”, feelings, partial fragments of their memories or buffs and effects, etc. but she must pay more stamina the further she stretches it. Once per round. "
ability,Jericho,Ravaging Rush,3,,"In a moment of primal strength Jericho wreathes herself in purple energy and dashes up to her movement +1 to an enemy, pouncing onto them. This allows her to make two basic attacks with advantage, and if she wishes she may continue to pin a target for future turns. While pinning a target she inflicts a touch at the start of her turn and her basic attacks continue to roll with advantage, but she must roll to maintain grappling, each turn gaining a stacking -2 as Jericho tries to regain her senses. Pinned targets may make a resist roll at the start of their turn. "
ability,Jericho,Defiance Engine,3,,"Jericho’s eyes flash with sinister light as a multitude of shadowy hands fly out from Jericho’s arm, reaching out to a target and savagely tearing out their essence, before pulling it back into Jericho’s waiting hand. As she crushes it, her epithet forms a power created from the target. Gain a temporary passive and ability based on the target’s “type” from a list, which replaces this ability for the rest of combat or until dismissed, after which this ability returns. If a target doesn’t fit an existing “type”, create a new one and add to the list permanently. Once per combat. If she wishes, Jericho can pull from the power her epithet has kept and randomly roll the already made Defiance Engine forms (1d10), doing this is not once per combat. Defiance Engine Types: 1. Human - Determination - Gain a +1 to all rolls. Each time you repeat an action you failed previously, gain a stacking +1 to its roll(s) until you succeed. You also tend to learn things quicker. Human Ingenuity (X) - Create a tool, item, or small structure or the like with surrounding materials. The complexity of these structures may be limited by the user’s own knowledge. Cost is decided by the item and roll. 2. Beast (Carnivore) - Hunt and Devour - When attacking, you crit on natural 19s and up. Additionally, the user’s sense of smell is enhanced greatly, and they gain advantage on all tracking rolls. Predator’s Pounce (3) (Full Turn Action) - The user forms all manner of predatory features (claws, teeth, spikes, etc) as they dash up to double their movement and pounce upon a target. They then rip into their target savagely, dealing 9 damage and inflicting 1d4 bleed (1 damage per turn for x turns). 3. Beast (Herbivore) - Scavenge and Survive - You gain an incredible natural sense of direction and intuition. Using these newfound talents, you may roll to “feel” out the location of something nearby, or sense danger. Additionally, while using defencive anytimes and the like you crit on 19+ and up. Pacifist’s Protection (1)! - Form some kind of animalistic defence to protect yourself from an attack or effect. This defence lasts until the start of your next turn. Once per round. 4. Glitchling - ¬®¯°±²AAAAAA - As a being of pure glitch, you roll 1 glitch effect at the start of your turn, every turn. After rolling the effect, you may choose to channel it into an adjacent target or object, inflicting them instead. You also get a glitchling claw basic attack (1 range 6 damage). Corruption Claw (1) - Coalesce glitchy energy into a large claw and rake it along anything in your path. Slash along 2 tiles starting from adjacent to you, inflicting anything hit with a glitch effect, or applying a general “glitchy” effect of your choice. 5. Imp - Bottom of the Hell-Rung - Imps are dime-a-dozen in Crimson Hell, the cannon fodder of the demon hierarchy. While dual-teching with another “weaker” character or a summon both parties roll with a +3. Additionally, you’re immune to fire. Hell-Swarm (3) - Imps may not be very strong, but one thing’s for sure, you’ll have a hard time trying to outnumber them. Summon 3 imps. They have Bottom of the Hell-Rung. 6. Demon (Crimson) - Hellfire Soul - You embody the crimson demon. You gain some control over fire, letting you generate flames and manipulate already existing sources as a bonus and/or action on your turn. Additionally you’re immune to fire, and Imps will completely obey your commands. Torment Furnace (3) - Lock a target in place with writhing flames that burst from the ground, then summon 3 imps around them to poke and prod them on your turn each turn until they escape. The fire bindings deal 1 damage each turn, and the Imps deal 3 damage at 1 range, each imp must roll to attack. 7. Ghost - Hallowed Body - You may turn intangible and back at will as a bonus action on your turn, while intangible you cannot interact with physical objects directly, but can move or “activate” them as a bonus action in a poltergeist fashion. In either form, you may interact with and attack all intangible things. Wretched Wail (1)! - Cry out like a ghost as you manifest the power of your grudge that chains you to the world of the living. Cause some dramatic ghostly effect such as possession, telekinesis, spooky effects (like blood on walls or sudden darkness), etc. Alternatively, you may just inflict a target within sight with a curse. Once per round. 8. Witch/Wizard - Master of the Arcane - As a master of magic you can detect when any form of magic (curses, wild magic, actual magic) is being cast, and roll to interrupt with a counterspell, either stopping or reversing it if successful.  Low rolls may work in an incredibly wonky way instead of outright failing, possibly even causing wild magic or a curse. Magic Spell (1)! - Cast a generic magic spell. Once per round. 9. Robot - Optimisation Operation - Your body becomes integrated with machinery, and you may optimise it much like a robot or cyborg might be able to. As a bonus action on your turn you may take one aspect of yourself, and “divert power” to another (this can be attack damage to movement, arm strength to leg strength, movement to sight, etc.). Again as a bonus action you may run the reset protocol and revert all changes made, otherwise they just revert at the end of combat. 10. Living Epithet - Inscription Embodyment - You feel the power of epithets flow through your veins. Roll 3 random words and pick one, you gain general powers based on that word that you can use to cause related effects or boost/change your abilities. Alternatively, if gained from an epithet via Defiance Engine you may use their word instead. ______ (X) - Spend any amount of stamina, then create and use an ability based on Inscription Embodyment’s word. It’s strength must be balanced to the amount of stamina spent, you may spend an additional 1 stamina to make it an anytime. No once per combats. The initial stamina spent is counted as the cost spent to use the ability the first time it’s used."
ability,Jericho,Hollowed Ground,5⛯,,"Jericho reaches violently towards the ground or a nearby surface and releases as much of her epithet as she can all at once. As she does this, cracks ripple out from it and the air becomes almost suffocating, draining the area of all colour, life and energy. Create a 5x5x5 space “dead zone”. Anyone in the area upon creation, and anyone that enters this area afterwards takes the effects of touching Jericho. Additionally, those inside take the effects of a touch each time they take an action, and their movement is halved. All epithet powers excluding Jericho’s are unable to exist within the area, as they're eaten away before they can even manifest. Lasts 2 rounds. Once per combat. "
weapon,Atticus,ADRA (Authorised Dimensional Rift Actualizer),,,"This “stun” baton utilises dimensional refraction to warp the very fabric of space to it’s will, and can even create literal “tears” in space with little to no risk to its user. Recall tech allows Atticus to teleport it back to his hand as an unrolled anytime action, once per round. As a bonus action, Atticus can choose to change ADRA to one of four settings, at various costs of charge. It is always set on stun at base. 5 damage 1 range. 1* Stun- Standard stun baton mode. Target’s movement is reduced by 2 and their anytimes cost 1 more until the end of their next turn. Can also be used to electrify or charge. 2* Bend- Space wobbles and moves unnaturally around the end of ADRA. Target is given extreme nausea making them have to roll for things they would be able to just do normally (movement, interacting with things/throwing, perception, etc.), +2 knockback. Can be used to launch or stretch affected matter at surprising effectiveness, almost making it rubber-like regardless of hardness. 2* Meld- Space seems to smudge or stick together and coalesce at the baton’s end. Targets can be attached to nearby objects or terrain, either trapping them or adding bonus effects to the attack. Attacks with this setting can be used to create “dense space”, almost like incredibly durable “walls” for cover, trapping, or any other such purpose. Additionally, space can be melded together with this setting for a variety of uses. 3* Tear- The most dangerous and technologically impressive setting, space literally tears apart at ADRA’s every attack in this setting. Damage is counted as slashing and bypasses DR, every attack -successful or not- creates a tear in space which deals 2 damage upon contact (when created via this attack it does not deal said damage) and pulls everything within 1 space into it, anything passing by these tears are pulled towards it (assuming it’d be affected by gravitational/spatial force) changing it’s course or even directing it into itself. If an enemy impacts with a tear they’re stuck partially inside it, dealing 3 damage per turn and requiring half their movement and roll to escape. Generally, Tear can rip through just about anything, and anything placed or stuck inside these “gaps” in space can be pulled from any other tears created by Atticus. Tears disappear after 3 turns. "
talent,Atticus,Almighty Occulus,,,"Oculus is completely synchronised with Atticus's body and mind, and can essentially access and control anything from him, such as memories, senses, bodily functions, etc. Oculus can also do general AI stuff like advanced calculations, and scanning the internet for info. She also has access to all police databases/cameras/radio signals, etc., and is built with basically all current technological ocular-enhancing functions under the sun. Utilising Oculus (such as manually controlling Atticus's bodily processes slightly, swapping ocular functions, or having her run a calculation/search) can be done as a bonus action on Atticus's turn, whether it needs to be rolled for is up to the GM’s discretion. Charge can be spent to increase the effectiveness of these actions. Oculus cannot be hacked in any way, has numerous safety features in place to avoid damage to Atticus, and her data is backed up constantly by utilising Atticus's epithet in case she is destroyed. "
passive,Atticus,Hotspot Hotshot,,,"Atticus constantly releases a strong wifi signal. No matter where he is, this internet “aura” persists and remains at high speeds. Atticus may set a password on his wifi, if he wishes. "
passive,Atticus,Cosmic Engine,,,"Atticus’s cybernetic enhancements and devices are powered by the most advanced technology in the Space Police’s arsenal: an infinite energy generator (among other things) made from an artificially created spatial anomaly, constantly in flux. The currently stored energy is kept track of in Atticus’s red stat, “charge” (charge costs are represented by *s on Atticus’s sheet). Atticus starts combat with 3 charge, and gains 1 charge at the start of every turn. He receives charge when he performs a successful action, protects an ally, crit succeeds, or takes/heals 5 or more damage in one hit (1 for each 5, if more). He may also attempt to drain energy from the environment. There is no limit to the amount of charge Atticus may hold. Energy Reserves - Atticus can now use energy to pay for his abilities. He may also spend it as a bonus action to “power himself up”, giving him near-superhuman abilities such as more movement, increased strength, super jumping prowess, etc. for a turn. The level is dependant on the amount spent. "
ability,Atticus,Interdimensional Bunker-Base,3!,,"Atticus has a secret base located deep, deep within an endless void of ever-shifting space. He uses it to store everything and anything from hazardous items to really nice furniture. It’s set up with a completely livable area (complete with a small bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room/office, and laundry!), and “storage” sections of varying types filled to the brim with various items and the like. Atticus can, using a small key-like device, create either a 2x2 area from inside the IDBB or a rift leading to any part of the IDBB within 8 spaces. Both doors and areas last for 1 round, if Atticus wishes to keep it open longer he must spend 1 stamina or 1 charge per turn. Rooms from the IDBB can contain various items and/or some sort of unique high-tech/anomalous item or the like (within reason), which can be taken and used, if he wishes, Atticus may spend charge to increase the effectiveness of the items or areas accessed this way. The IDBB is virtually impossible to find or teleport/return to, even for beings who can traverse dimensions or planes with little to no effort at all as a result of it’s cutting edge spatial refraction and extremely anomalous location. Once per round. "
ability,Atticus,Resonance Relay,3,,"Atticus presses some device hidden on his person as a high-tech internet tower constructs within 5 spaces. These towers have a 1 space aura with the effects of Hotspot Hotshot at base, and 6 stamina. For Atticus, anything within the tower’s aura is considered within range for his abilities, and he may use abilities through them (and have them take the stamina cost, if he wishes). While within a tower’s aura as an anytime, or when creating a tower, he may spend 3 charge to increase it’s aura by 1 space, and it’s stamina by 3. He may also spend charge to repair it, healing 2 stam per point. Finally, if an aura or effect is active within a tower’s aura Atticus may spend X (X being decided by the severity of the effect) stamina as an unrolled anytime to ""upload"" it into the wi-fi, extending it along its aura and into all other towers whos aura is touching theirs until dismissed, all towers are destroyed, or the end of combat. "
ability,Atticus,ADRA Overcharge,0,,"Atticus raises the ADRA, and diverts massive amounts of energy into it as it begins to crackle with black spatial lightning. Spend charge to use a supercharged version of one of ADRA's settings. If no charge is spent instead of the following effects Atticus makes a basic attack with the ADRA, dealing 1.5 rounded down damage at 2x range, with a +3 to it’s roll. 5/4* Stun- Blue-black electricity arcs wildly from the ADRA, flooding outwards towards a target within 3 spaces for 8 damage, then arcing to any enemies within 2 spaces of them for 4, and finally to enemies within 2 spaces of those hit with that strike for 2. Targets hit by this attack suffer a -2 to movement and a -3 to anytime rolls. By spending 4 charge instead, Atticus can just thrust ADRA into a target for 2x damage, brutally stunning them for a round. While stunned they lose their movement, and can only perform an action -no extra action economy such as bonus, swift or free actions. They can use anytimes, but do so at disadvantage. 4/6* Bend- The small area of strange wobbly space at ADRA’s tip expands and intensifies greatly, creating a disorienting area of warped space at the whim of Atticus. Using this Atticus may send something (regardless of size or weight) rocketing 6 spaces or more, stretch something any way he wishes over 6 tiles total, or just whack someone in range with 8 knockback, inflicting them with intense nausea for a turn making them have to roll for things they would be able to just do normally at disadvantage. By spending 6 charge instead Atticus can expand and shoot off the “bubble” of wobbly space, creating a 3x3 “warped space” zone within 4 spaces for 2 turns. The fabric of space in this area is constantly shifting causing several effects: the area counts as 1 total space, enemies within the space lose all senses of direction and are constantly moved around meaning it’s very difficult to escape, and space/time related effects are warped or do not function normally within the area. 4/3xX* Meld- Space seems to ripple at the baton’s tip as lightning crackles throughout the air. Atticus melds space together within a 2x4 area with a single swing. He may choose to just harden and stick space together with this, creating one big incredibly hard wall of space, or combine objects/the environment for various effects. If an enemy is caught in this effect they are greatly trapped. Atticus may instead spend multiples of 3 charge to give allies within 2 spaces 2 DR for a turn, skilfully creating hard-space armour around them. 6/10* Tear- The air around Atticus shudders as the ADRA vibrates violently, ready to execute any space in its way. Create a 1x3 tear in space, dealing 8 damage to all hit initially. For the next 2 turns this large rift violently pulls in everything around it inside itself, anything passing by these tears is also pulled towards it (assuming it’d be affected by gravitational/spatial force) changing it’s course or even directing it into itself, the tear deals 4 damage to anything that makes contact or starts it’s turn inside of it. Attempting to escape requires a roll and half movement. By spending 10 charge Atticus may push the ADRA to its very limits, and create a massive tear 2x3 or 1x6 in size, which deals 10 damage to any who make contact. This tear acts the same way others do, but is generally stronger and harder to escape. "
weapon,Dr. Epithet PhD,Doctor’s Best Friend ,,,"It’s a gun...oh wait...no its not. Dr Epithet PhD has a special custom syringe gun, it doesn’t fire anything but Dr Epithet PhD can stab it into people and if they have an epithet they can remove a portion of its essence, storing it in a vial, this does roughly 2 damage and does not normally impact the target in any other way. He can have 4 of these vials filled at a time and he can inject them into people to give them temporary access to that epithet, injecting deals 1 damage. (Yes, this part does work on mundies) These Are All Very Legal... I Have A PhD - The Doctor PhD has been tinkering with his syringe gun and has added some new (very legal) mods and features. Unfortunately they can’t be activated simultaneously so he has to choose between one of three options at the start of combat to apply to his gun. 1. Thunderbolt Needle - An extended needle that fits nicely into the end of the gun and extends the range by 1 and the damage by 3 while still keeping the integrity of the device. 2. Compound Vials - A special vial that allows Doctor E PhD to take 2 samples at once from inscribed individuals and while it will slightly weaken the inherent epithet essence due to lower amounts it allows Dr E PhD to fuse those epithets to create a single ability. He may only have 2 of these per combat and after combat he sends them back to his lab. 3. Replacement Blood - Turns out. You need blood to live and well, removing portions of people’s epithets makes people woozy. As such whenever he uses a syringe on a target he may choose to heal them for the damage he would have otherwise dealt. This blood is very legal and he did not need to go to great lengths or blackmarkets to get it. Why would you even suggest that?"
weapon,Dr. Epithet PhD,Locution,,,"Dr E PhD has been working with some top researchers and blacksmiths to create his own personal sword. A katana, as suggested by his colleague Dr Love. 8 Damage 1 Range. The material making Locution is uniquely receptive to Dr E PhD’s “”Doctor Powers” which allows him to perform a bevy of effects by spending up to 5 stamina. Only one of the effects may be activated per turn and at a time, with the exception of ones that he is paying upkeep for specifically. EXCISION - When Dr E PhD slashes with Locution he can run his capabilities down the blade to either dampen the effects of an epithet or warp an epithet power that he currently has access to. If he is not using this on a unit in combat, it is a bonus action. IMPLANT - When he uses Locution, Dr E PhD can either run the power of an epithet he has access across the blade to add an effect of his choice to it or enhance the effects of an epithet already running through it, his target or of an ally that is using an epithet power as a dual tech. EXAMINATION - Locution passively resonates with Dr E PhD which allows him to increase the area his passive is active by spaces equal to the stamina he spends on it (with equivalent upkeep). In addition, while holding Locution, Dr E PhD can naturally sense any lexical energy within his aura and pinpoint it’s locations and perhaps general effects. Finally, for some odd reason, Locution acts as a divining rod."

Things he can do include somewhat neutralizing epithet powers, making small changes to epithet-related effects and abilities temporarily (like increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or changing various aspects or numbers slightly), and determining the ”intent” of an epithet and its relationship with it’s user (basically, he can tell how in sync/proficient a user is with their epithet and potentially discover small snippets of how their epithet works/what it can do). When using this passive for it’s information gathering purposes it can be used as a bonus action. As combat goes on he is able to more accurately determine how the epithets of others work making them easier to manipulate and increasing the distance he can manipulate them from, by actively studying key features and attributes of an epithet he may increase this earlier. This does not work against Mundie “powers”. 48: Doctor’s Notes - Information gathering on epithets is a once per turn free action and epithet manipulation is a swift action. "

Temporarily transform the L.O.R.D. into a copy of a regalia that he can see, or form a regalia based on an epithet he can see, allowing him to perform effects based on their epithet. Generally epithets that are already Regalia type are slightly stronger. Free action. Temporarily transform the L.O.R.D. into a “counter regalia” of an epithet he can see. This creates a regalia construct that acts as a direct opposite to that epithet, and allows him to perform effects based on the new creation. This is more powerful against regalia type epithets. Action. Create a sizable “counter effect” to a currently active epithet effect Dr. E PhD can see or is being affected by. This costs variable amounts of stamina, based on the desired effect and the strength of the epithet it is countering. This cannot be used if the L.O.R.D. is transformed. Swift/Bonus action. Store or take a weapon from the L.O.R.D.’s lexical “armory”. This subspace can store anything considered an “armament”. As bonus action Dr. E PhD can fuse, enhance, or alter weapons within the armory, at variable cost dependant on the strength of the change. The armory carries between sessions. This cannot be used if the L.O.R.D. is transformed. Particularly powerful manifestations may incur an upkeep cost, and the L.O.R.D. may be passed to allies, allowing them to use it as they wish.

If he is feeling dubious he can pull out 3 vials of previously prepared epithet (3 random words, does not cap his weapon vials). These vials can be injected into people allowing them to temporarily gain that epithet and incorporate it with their own (if they have one already), this section of the ability is once per combat and costs 2 additional stamina but he can keep all three vials if he doesn’t use them. **22 - Double Dose:** Not only is the effectiveness of this not weakened when he uses it on himself but he may also spend 1 extra stamina grant the aspects of single random epithet vial to his target allowing them to modify their own actions with that epithet for the next 2 rounds. If he has a vial already he may use that instead and grant it’s effects till the end of combat. **28  - Is There A Doctor (PhD) Around?:** Yes. A Dr Epithet PhD in fact.

For purely scientific reasons, he won’t tell them he did this or even which one, but it is a more pure and condensed sample of it, making it much more potent.

passive,Clover,"Ultimate Guide, Grimoire",,,"Clover’s epithet manifests itself in the form of a floating phone which she has fondly named Grimoire, or “Grim” for short. Grimoire has an incredible assortment of high-tech features, but it’s main strength lies in it’s “guide” function. As a free action on her turn, Clover can type or speak a question into Grimoire (such as “How do I get home?”, “Where’s the password to the computer?” or “How could I exploit the enemies weakness?”) and it will answer her with an easy-to-follow guide, explaining the process of how to achieve the answer to her question. Grimoire is not human, however -and thus does not have a human level of understanding. The guide it gives her depends heavily on how she asks the question and may not take into account any complexities ...so Grim may give her some very disappointing answers, if asked clumsily. e.g. If she asks “What’s the easiest way to knock out the enemy?” it will likely give her a guide with the steps: 1. Hit the enemy incredibly hard, multiple times, with strength greater than their own. 2. Repeat step 1 until the enemy is knocked out. Or 1. Let others take them out, providing minimal to no support. (this would be because she asked for the “easiest way” instead of just “a way”, overriding her capabilities in the equation. In most other circumstances, it will give a helpful guide.) Additionally, Clover’s proficiency may factor into how much info Grimoire can pull from the world, so extremely deep, well kept secrets and information may remain somewhat out of Grimoire’s grasp until more clues are collected. Instead of asking a specific question Clover can set Grim to auto-guide, simply granting herself or an ally within hearing range a passive +3 to rolls relating to a specific goal. Finally, Grimoire can be teleported to Clover’s hands or transformed into any kind of phone (or tablet) she’s seen as a free action on her turn.

Chad can spend the remainder of his movement to go into a defensive position with his surfboard and enemies have a negative to hit him equal to 1.5x the amount of movement he has leftover (rounded up). This modifier is removed if Chad willingly moves in any way and goes away at the start of his turn. He must spend a full movement action to change back into an aggressive stance in order to use any weapon (his gun) again.
weapon,Chad,A Real Ass Gun,,,Chad being an enrolled police officer has a gun with him for situations that would require it. It is standard procedure. He also provides himself with his own ammunition made up of salt so the police prescient can save money.

Also if Chad rolls a 20 he can instead choose to give himself 2 stamina instead to improve his mascle mass."
talent,Chad,Oh yeah I'm resistant to poisons,,,"Chad just remembered that due to the thin layer of salt covering his outsides, he *also* has a thin layer of salt covering his insides and cells making everything really durable. Most poisons that would kill a man tend to not really affect chad due to this. All poison damage Chad has taken up to this point has just been an extreme placebo effect which still affected him and does not retroactively heal him. This also explains him being able to make bandages for himself out of salt cause his blood is completely saturated with salt."
passive,Chad,He can walk on water. **AND SWIM ON LAND**.,,,Due to his awesome mom being from the bottom of the red sea Chad has a super awesome connection to water. For starters he’s able to walk/run across water surfaces. Pretty cool right? BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE. Any kind of solid turns to a kind of liquid around chad. This allows him to swim through surfaces to perform his abilities. He can also surf on it which is kinda weird to look at. He can choose to stretch this aura to extend 2.5 ft radius (his icon) in any direction around him or to just have it affect solids that are touching his skin. 
passive,Chad,The Only Fish in the Sea,,,"Chad is the biggest threat on the field. No matter where he is. Like why either bother trying to hurt his allies when he's just gonna take advantage of the fact that you aren't even focusing on him anymore. Whenever an enemy targets someone other than Chad with an attack/ability, (not cool bro) Chad can use any of his attacks/abilities that would be in range of the enemy on said enemy. Once per round. 55 - Maybe there’s two fish in the sea. -  Only Fish In the see can now be used TWICE per round. However if he uses it against the same target he has to pay an additional 3 stamina on top of what he is normally paying."
ability,Chad,Asalt Armory,1!,,Chad is a salty boy from the Red Sea. He scrapes the salt that easily collects on his skin and crafts it into a weapon or tools for him or his allies to use. The more complex it is the harder it is to make. He can use the item right after using this ability or use it later. The tools have a strange red tint to it as well. Chad surprisingly knows how to use a number of odd/weird tools that he makes with this ability. 45 - Asalt Weapons upgrades to Asalt Armory. Asalt Armory is an anytime action that can make more complex items made of salt way easier. Chad is also now able to make rudimentary armor with this anytime action that he can add for extra defense for himself or an ally that is adjacent to him! Also because of the new abundance and quality of salt his bullets deal an extra point of damage. He can also use Asalt Armory as a Bonus Action on his turn (even if he has already used it as an anytime) to give himself a pair of Asalt Gauntlets that last for 1d4 charges for any of the new weapons below.
ability,Chad,Diver's Grave,3,,"Chad has always been a fan of theatrics and making himself look cool. Chad dives into the ground below him and moves his movement to be below an enemy. Using the velocity of swimming upwards through the floor as he emerges, he grabs his target and tombstones them dealing 10 damage and crippling them for one round (whatever debuff that may be). Takes one round to recharge. 57 - Diver’s Maneuverability - Diver’s Grave now does not take a round to recharge and can move an enemy 3 spaces from where they originally were. Damage can be traded to increase the number of spaces moved."
ability,Chad,A Part of MY World,2,,Chad’s favorite Disney princess was Ariel. The liquid land around Chad spreads out in an  extra 3 space radius sphere around him turning the land around him into a whirlpool. The torrent pulls every enemy in the liquid land directly next to him. Chad is able to use any tools/weapons created by Asalt Armory targets that are pulled next to him. After a weapons is used with this effect it can't be used again
ability,Chad,Salty Slam,1,,Chad **BODIES** a target within melee range dealing 6 damage and making the target fall prone. Chad then has advantage on actions while the target is prone. They can choose to spend half their movement (rounding up) to get up from being prone.
ability,Chad,"Neptune, Chad of The Sea",8,,Chad enters a stance taught to him by his ocean dwelling ancestors reaching a state of pure chill ocean vibes. He extends his aura to a 2 space radius around him turning all inorganic solids of Chad's choice around him into a liquid state no matter the composition of the solid. This aura follows him around as he moves. Treat the liquid land as water for movement purposes. In this state Chad’s movement increases by 3 if he is swimming (which you can assume that he is while this is active). Only Fish in the Sea also has no restriction and can be used as many times as Chad wants in this state. He pays an additional stamina X points every time he uses The Only Fish in The Sea. X being the number of times that he has used the only fish in the sea this combat divided by 2. This costs 8 stamina to activate and 2 stamina to maintain at the start of his turn.
weapon,Malketh,Bone Rattler,,,"Malketh carries around an airsoft pistol that is filled with little BONE and milk pellets. Due to him not having any muscle mass to hold the recoil of the gun he can only get 1 shot off at 6 range and 2 damage with BONE pellets and heals for 2 with milk pellets. When a target is hit by one of Malketh’s BONE pellets or milk pellets they are affected by the **BONED** condition. Due to Malketh’s bones being intertwined with the target’s bones, enemies have a  -X penalty to hit Malketh and allies with the **BONED** condition. X is the number of entities with the **BONED** condition. X cannot exceed 3. The **BONED** condition wears off after 1d4 turns on enemies and does not wear off on allies. The counter goes down at the start of Malketh's turn. Now infused with Brocacola™ the BONE Rattler can shoot fruit punch instead."
weapon,Malketh,BONE GLOCK,,,Now Malketh has a glock that shoots BONE and MILK bullets. Damage and healing increases by 3. Additionally roll an extra d4 to see how long BONED last. 
weapon,Malketh,*BONE* AND ARROW,,,"Due to the power of ***BONES*** The **BONE BUDDY** produces a bow an arrow from the game of mine craft. For some reason the **BONE BUDDY** is a really good shot with the bow and arrow like skeletons are in minecraft, because of this it is really hard for it to miss. "
talent,Malketh,Adaptive Bones,,,"Malketh is actually pretty smart and clever when it comes to his epithet, even if he can’t do basic math or read. Malketh is able to sacrifice certain aspects of his buffing abilities to be other things. Ex: Trading DR for movement. How much Malketh is able to switch around is up to the GM and the roll."
talent,Malketh,Skelly Separation,,,"Malketh can now split himself into multiple BONE segments without consequence. For instance, he can remove his own arms or head and control them remotely, for whatever purpose Malketh may find."
talent,Malketh,"PEOPLE ARE SAYING I LOOK LIKE SANS UNDERTALE, BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE. HE IS LAZY, AND A COWARD, AND I AM NOT A COWARD",,,"If anyone ever likens Malketh to a certain blue eyed skeleton, he can instantly teleport over to them and automatically land a basic attack against them. This cannot be used to heal allies."
passive,Malketh,My Bonely Friend,,,"When Malketh reveals this passive he quickly regenerates his body from the neck down creating a Bone Buddy. This passive is revealed once the party finds out Malketh is actually a skeleton. The Bone Buddy has half of the max health of Malketh rounded up. Malketh can use his movement or his anytime action BONEMANCY in order to have the Bone Buddy use an ability. Bone Buddy cannot double up on actions with Malketh using BONEmancy and his move action on Bone Buddy. Bone Buddy is for intents and purposes an exact copy of Malketh and can use any of his abilities/attacks with the exception of Bonemancy, the Bone Buddy cannot repeat once per combats. Malketh’s other passive and talents also apply to the Bone Buddy. If the Bone Buddy is destroyed Malketh has to pay 3 stamina permanently to bring them back. He also carries around a matching tracksuit for them in his ribcage. (23) The PlayStation can produce mind-boggling effects - The shock of Malketh’s Bone Buddy appearing out of nowhere completely boggles the minds of Malketh’s enemies! This gives Malketh enough time to apply a bonely archetype to the Bone Buddy! These archetypes take the form of a stereotypical skeleton monster type, such as medieval warrior, pirate, or Minecraft. Archetypes give the Bone Buddy special properties dependent on what the archetype is."
passive,Malketh,BONE Vision,,,Malketh sees everything through BONES. Malketh’s bone sight extends up to 15 spaces away from him. This gives him a sort of X-Ray vision through certain objects. He was able to develop a technique that vibrates the people’s bones around him to hear his voice in their head. They can’t respond back in their head though. That would be silly. Also even though he sees things as bones he is still affected by blinding/sight effects like sand in his eyes or invisibility. He can see spooky things perfectly clearly.
passive,Malketh,Good Thing IM IMOOOORTAAAAL,,,Due to Malketh epithet no matter how many bones he breaks he can still regenerate from a skeleton of his. Good thing he always keeps a skeleton of himself in his closet. His skull also explodes in useless milk when it is destroyed.
passive,Malketh,Flavored Beverages,,,"Malketh now has a stance system that impacts all abilities that produce MILK. As a free action at the start of his turn, he can pay 1 stamina to spin his head around and change his BONE color to either a rich brown CHOCOLATE or a soft pink STRAWBERRY (or back to pure white default). When in CHOCOLATE stance, MILK grants +1 extra damage resistance, but -2 healing. When in STRAWBERRY stance, MILK grants +2 healing, but damage resistance lasts one less round."
ability,Malketh,HE NEEDS SOME MILK,1,,"Malketh opens their mouth and milk comes pouring out from their skull. Malketh cups it and gives it to an ally for 4 stamina and +1 damage resistance for 1 round. The milk comes from somewhere within the skull. For 1 extra stamina Malketh can apply the **BONED** condition to the ally.  If the ally is under the **BONED** condition the damage resistance lasts for 1d3 rounds. (32) MILK REFRIGERATION - Malketh cannot only keep MILK created from HE NEEDS SOME MILK in between combats and sessions by containing them in cute little cartens, but if he has multiple milk cartons on him at a given time, he can give all of them to a unit in one action, granting all buffs at once."
ability,Malketh,Bonemancy,1!,,Due to Malketh’s Bone manipulation power he is able to take control over certain bones in another person’s body at the cost of losing manipulation of the corresponding bone in his own skeleton. With a pretty long range of 10. The more bones he tries to manipulate the harder it is to control. Enemies can only be affected by this ability if they have the **BONED** condition applied to them. Same goes for allies. (30) You’re BONED No Matter What! - Units no longer need to be BONED to be affected by Bonemancy.
ability,Malketh,MILK GEYSER,2,,Malketh unhinges his jaw and a TORRENT of milk shoots out in a 10 spaced line. All allies within Malketh’s glorious milk heals for 4. All enemies in the torrent are pushed out of it. Pushed to the end oh high rolls and pushed to the side on lower rolls. Malketh can pay 1 extra stamina and each ally within the milk torrent has the **BONED** condition applied to them. If an ally is **BONED** and is hit with this they gain +1 damage resistance for 1 round. This damage resistance can stack with other damage resistance.
ability,Malketh,Skull and CrossBONES,3,,"X marks the spot of you being BONED!! Malketh rattles his ribcage and produces an X with one BONE spot in an origin space within 5 of Malketh’s current position, and accompanying BONE spots on each corner of that space. This is also known as the BONE ZONE. When someone steps on one of these spaces, they immediately gain the BONED condition, and all damage and healing inflicted on a unit standing on one of the spaces gets a 1.5x multiplier. All natural crits rolled also give +1 extra proficiency if the roller is standing on a BONE spot."
weapon,Bur,Bur Claw,,,Bur has big Bur Claws that bur can use to do a… BUR SLASH. Bur claws in a circle around him dealing 3 damage to enemies in every space adjacent to him. For every 5 points in the Blight Gauge the area of the damage increases by 1 space or for every 10 deal an extra 1 damage.
weapon,Bur,Bur Maul,,,Bur mauls a target spending blight in increments of 3 to deal damage in increments of 2 respectively. 
weapon,Bur,Bur Beam,,,Bur condsenses blighted energy within him and shoots it out at a target dealing 1 damage for every 3 blight spent on this attack. For every 2 points in the blight gauge the range of this attack increases by 1
talent,Bur,Bur is Super Cool,,,"Bur is a bur. Burs are really cool. Burs can do so many different things. Like, be strong, like be super cool, and also be able to completely understand the legal system that resides in any culture. Bur is a good lawyer. Also due to being a Bur, Bur takes up a 2x2 space."
talent,Bur,Trail of Blight ,,,When Bur Moves around Bur leaves X number of blighted terrain spaces in his wake. X is equal to ⅔ of the amount of Blight in the Blight Gauge. Enemies walking through Blighted Terrain take damage equal to 1/4 of the amount of blight currently in the Blight Gauge rounding up. Allies when they use an ability or attack that passes through or originates in the blighted terrain they receive a buff to the ability which is similar to how Blight affects Bur’s kit. These upgrades can be thought up of beforehand or on the spot.
talent,Bur,Bur’s family is the best family,,,"If Bur is able to convince someone to come and join his ""family"", Bur gains a proficiency!"
ability,Bur,Intimidating Bur,2,,"Bur looks at a target and puffs up his fur trying his hardest to be intimidating, not really putting a lot of effort into it. For some reason whoever Bur is looking at seems to be absolutely terrified of what they just witnessed, giving them disadvantage on rolls while Bur is within their eyesight. This lasts for 1 round. Bur can spend 4 blight points to either have this last an extra round or target another person. When Bur is over 10 points in the blight gauge he has advantage on rolls against targets affected by this ability."
ability,Bur,Be Like Bur,1,,"Bur selects a willing target and infuses them with energy from the primal plane of existence and they receive a new addition to their kit whether that is a weapon, ability, or passive depending on what the target wants. The restriction to this new addition is that it has a “primal” aspect that can easily be related to the target kit. Whenever this new addition is used Bur gains a d4 of blight. Bur can spend 5 blight and 2 stamina to have this target another ally. For every 6 points in the blight gauge the new addition gets a numerical 1 to be placed wherever."
ability,Bur,Primal Bur,3,,"Bur reverts backs to Bur’s old mindset turning Bur into a primal version of himself. Bur while in this form gains an extra d4 to generate Blight but takes damage at the start of his turn equal to half the amount of total blight in his gauge. Bur while in this form reduces all costs that blight by half (rounding up). He also gains a passive DR equal to ⅛ his total amount of blight. Bur upon succeeding this ability, Bur can immediately use one of his basic weapons but it does not generate blight."
weapon,Blubbles,Flippers,,,Slap your enemies with dolphin fury for 1 damage. 1 Range.
weapon,Blubbles,Bite,,,Blubbles bites the enemy’s legs and toes for 2 damage but may have a chance to slow the enemy down on high rolls. 1 Range.
talent,Blubbles,Athletic Dolphin,,,Blubbles knows how to swim quite well in anything and is very experienced. +2 to movement. Allies can also grab onto Blubbles if he is moving past them and ride with him the rest of his spaces.
passive,Blubbles,Land Dolphin,,,Blubbles is a dolphin of extraordinary power. He can swim in land. This allows him to quickly zip through terrain and obstacles like it was water. Whenever an ally or enemy touches Blubbes they are put into the same effect with treating land as water.
passive,Blubbles,Bubble Bop,,,"On high rolls, this can inflict a stack of “Bubble” onto the target. When Blubbles hits a target with any number of stacks, he can bounce off of their bubbles, granting him a bonus movement action with spaces equal to the number of Bubble Stacks expended. If Blubbes ends this movement adjacent to any target that isn’t the one he bounced off of, he can perform a VERY slightly weaker basic attack on them"
ability,Blubbles,Dolphin Cheer,3!⛯,,"Range 6, Blubbles cheers for you believing in you! On your next three rolls you get a plus 3 to all of them! Once Per Combat. 14. SCREECH - Dolphin Cheer now has a second variation, where it only has 3 range and only gives a +2, but by making this sound it causes all enemies within 2 spaces of the target to take a -2 to their next three rolls, while also taking 3 damage."
ability,Blubbles,Dolphin Hug ,2,,"Blubbles hugs an adjacent ally. The person is filled with DETERMINATION, healing for 3 and giving a +2 to their next roll."
ability,Blubbles,Dolphin CHARGE ,3,,Blubbles charges an enemy swimming at super fast speeds. For every square Blubbles moves he gets a +1 to his flipper damage. Must be in a straight line.
weapon,Kyo,Tzionic Blasts,,,"Kyo creates two orbs of pure energy in their palms and winds up a fastball.  These orbs each deal 4 damage up to 5 spaces away. They can use them both on the same target or both on different targets.  If used on the same target, the roll has a +2 bonus, but will only deal 6 damage maximum. 39: Always Flying - Kyo can attack with Tzionic Blasts in the middle of their movement, and the damage cap on it is removed."
talent,Kyo,"Breaking The System, And Your Face",,,"Kyo deals 1 additional damage to any character who could be described as a capitalist, fascist, abuser, or oppressor.  This will not apply if they are already dealing 7 damage or more with an attack or ability."
talent,Kyo,Ducking The Consequences,,,It is extremely difficult to arrest Kyo for any reason.  They’ve done this song and dance before.
talent,Kyo,Lover and a Fighter,,,"Kyo is incredibly hot, and generally pretty likeable.  They have several boyfriends and girlfriends.  Twice per session, they can call one of these significant others and ask them for some kind of mild favor, whether bringing them an object, giving them information about something, or anything else within the capabilities of a mundane, but caring, person."
passive,Kyo,Screw the Rules,,,"Kyo’s epithet and devil-may-care attitude allow them to break almost any rule, no matter how mundane, cosmic, or abstract, and damn the consequences.  They are exempt from the tyrannies most people consider normal, like ‘societal labels’ or ‘the laws of physics’.  As a bonus action their turn, Kyo can break, change, or create any rule, either pertaining to the usual laws of the universe, a rule of the Epithet System, or almost anything else they can imagine, without making a roll.  Living things should run wild and free!"
ability,Kyo,Ride The Lightning,2,,"Energy surges around Kyo for a moment before blasting them forward, a trail of orange lightning crackling behind them.  They can immediately move up to 7 spaces, including upwards or downwards, and anyone they pass through takes 3 damage.  They can’t damage a target more than once during this ability.  The lightning that’s left behind also deals 2 damage to anyone who passes through it on subsequent turns, but if an ally passes over it, they can attempt to ride the lightning, ending in a space adjacent to the endpoint of the lightning.  They have to roll for this, though.  The lightning disappears after 2 rounds."
ability,Kyo,Fuck The System ,2,,"Kyo can do just about anything.  They can use this ability to change or break a rule on the fly, immediately altering something that just occured or is just about to happen.  This is still subject to the limitations of their passive.  Twice per combat, once per round. 41: Fuck Your Character Sheet In Its Badly-Worded ASS - Once per combat, Kyo can use ‘Fuck The System’ to make a single, relatively simple change to someone’s character sheet that is not their own. This change lasts for the rest of combat. The change cannot be detrimental."
ability,Kyo,Knock Em’ Into The Sun,1,,"Pretty simple, really - Kyo winds up an attack infused with energy and speed and blasts into someone, charging at a target within 8 spaces and dealing 6 damage to them on a hit.  This attack knocks back the target half the number of spaces (rounded down) as points of damage they take.  They can use this ability as a free action if they use it directly after a successful ‘Ride The Lightning’ roll, but it will cost 2 Stamina if they use it this way."
ability,Kyo,Molecular Diffusion,1!,,"Kyo doesn’t really subscribe to the whole ‘bound to your physical form’ thing. Sounds made up if you ask them. When someone makes an attack against them, they can suddenly dissolve into pure Tzion, dodging it. If they successfully reduce or negate the damage, and the attacker is in range of Kyo’s basic attack, they can spend 1 additional Stamina to use it against them immediately (only a single orb, though). Once per round. 50: Minecraft Speedrunner vs. 4 Hunters - Kyo is currently the world record holder for the world’s fastest speedrun of Minecraft (created by Hatsune Miku of course), in the DBA universe, at 1 minute and 47 seconds. The Speedrun Police can’t prove whether they’re cheating or not. They have a very successful Let’s Play series where they evade multiple people trying to stop them from beating Minecraft without even using their powers. And since video games are real life, this has made Kyo even better at dodging and fighting multiple opponents than they already are. When Kyo uses ‘Molecular Diffusion’, they can spend 1-3 additional Stamina to immediately move up to twice the cost’s spaces in any direction, and in addition, on rolls of 15+ they gain 2 DR against all damage for the remainder of the turn they use this on, which takes effect before any other damage would be applied from the attack they’re dodging."
weapon,Oritov,SHIELD OF THE CARD CZAR,,,"When ALL ELSE FAILS it comes to ME to use my own QUITE SPECIAL AND DEADLY BUCKLER to IMPART MY FORCE OF WILL UPON AN ENEMY!!! I can THROW this shield at a range of 5, dealing 7 DAMAGE!!! The shield ordinarily RETURNS TO ME, IT’S MASTER, AS IT ***SHOULD!***"
talent,Oritov,Heart's Stone,,,"A gem filled with an emotionally resonant magic, in times of desperation you may call upon its power to pull off feats of incredible power, some might say even that which bends fate. As a free action you may call upon it to guarantee one non d20 luck based event plays out how you wish or may call upon its energy for a massive magical power boost to your next action. Once per session."
passive,Oritov,DECK OF THE GRANDMASTERRRRRRRRR,,,"I carry with me a DECK OF CARDS, approximately THIRTY IN NUMBER! This deck carries with me only the FINEST of cards (of the game Fireside), which I shall list in a SEPARATE DOCUMENT!!! I start each combat with 4 cards and AUTOMATICALLY DRAW ONE AT THE START OF MY TURNS! I also have a red stat called MANA, of which I start with a max of THREE! This maximum goes up for every round that passes, up to a maximum of ten mana!!! MANA REFILLS AT THE START OF EACH OF MY TURNS AND I, ORITOV, MAY PLAY AS MANY CARDS AS I HAVE MANA FOR AS AN ACTION!!! Each card has a specific MANA COST to it, which I heed GREATLY as I am truly a GRAND and MASTERFUL GRAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNDMAAAAASSSSSTEEERRRRRR! However, I can only have up to 10 cards in my hand. Not having cards in my deck by the end of my turn means I take TWO DAMAGE, AS IT TROUBLES ME TO NOT HAVE ANY! 60 -  AS I, OOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRIIIIIITOOOOVVVV, GROW GRANDER AND PERHAPS EVEN…MASTERER, so too does my CARD GAME SKILLS! Now, my deck size increases by FIVE! I gain 2 MAX MANA PER ROUND!!! And for EVERY deck of cards I have in my possession, I can draw ONE CARD FROM UP TO THREE DECKS I HAVE ACCESS WHENEVER I WOULD DRAW, and I have a CONSTANT +4 TO PLAY ANY GAME OF CARDS!!! FEAR MY SKILLS!!!!!!"
passive,Oritov,Yeah I’m Kind Of A Big Fucking Deal.,,,"Don’t even THINK of saying you haven’t heard of me. I have TRIPLE ADVANTAGE on all charisma based rolls because I, OOOOOOOORRRRIIITOOOOOVVVV am JUST THAT CHARMING! This ALSO allows me to use my movement action or the usage of any of the various bonus actions I may take on my turn to grant up to 2 allies on the field ADVANTAGE ON ANY ONE ROLL THEY WANT UNTIL THE END OF THEIR NEXT TURN!"
ability,Oritov,GRANDMASTER SPECIALTY,3!,,"I have a VERY special trick up my sleeve!!! You see, I have a card that is always HIDDEN UP MY SLEEVE! This special card allows me to DRAW A CARD!! However, this card has THREE DEDUCTED FROM ITS MANA COST! I can only use this once per two rounds, but it is WORTH IT!!!!"
ability,Oritov,Essenceburn,0!,,"Mehehehe, I’ve come up with a CHEEKY TECHNIQUE!!! You see, I can temporarily OVER-FILL MY MANA BAR!!! However, this comes at a GREAT COST! However much mana I INTENSELY DESIRE, I must spend TWO OF MY LIFE ESSENCE FOR EVERY MANA!!! The cost of this ability is HOW MUCH LIFE I SPEND TO GAIN MANA! I shall warn you though, reducing the amount of Mana I gain from how much I spend is KIND OF A ‘DICK MOVE’ if I spend a lot! I am WARNING YOU, I will rain ***EVIL TEARS UPON YOUR BLOODLINE!!!*** I am, however, UNABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN 10 MANA, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!! That would be against the rules!"
ability,Oritov,***HA!*** *You think you can touch the GRANDMASTER!?!?*,0!,,"Oritov parries an attack, with high rolls allowing him a counterattack with his basic weapon if the attacker is in range."
ability,Oritov,One Becomes Two,3⛯,,"Once per combat, you may split yourself into two. Each half has max stamina and current stamina equal to half your max and current when you split, with one half rounding up and the other rounding down."
weapon,Robin,The B.I.T.C.H [Gun],,,The Blunt or Impaling Tool for Critical Harming. Turns out this dumb ass weapon has a gun inside it. Why the fuck is there a gun inside it? Who knows. Deals 3 damage at 5 range. [Empty Mod Slot] [Empty Mod Slot]

talent,Robin,Sneak a Little Extra,,,"Robin, due to how sly he has to be to use his epithet to its fullest potential, is a bit of a sneaky bastard. Always taking more than he was originally offered. Whenever Robin steals Essence, he can take one extra that is either the same or another type. Once per session, at the end of a combat. Robin may attempt to take 1 extra from any type of combat rewards, and must roll a d20 to make sure the Gods don’t notice his shenanigans. [Empty Mod Slot]"
passive,Robin,The Edison Way,,,"Robin’s very epithet makes it so that making original ideas is incredibly hard, but who needs original thinking when there’s ideas all around you! All he needs to do is just....borrow it. Robin has the ability to modify any ability of his or any other persons using ‘Essence’. Which is a small concentrated portion of a person’s epithet or general powerset manifested into an object. The object itself does not need to correlate to what has been taken, but it will have iconography of it plastered on it [EG fire essence can take the form of glasses with a hotrot flame]. Of course, not everyone is as malleable as he is. When he gives people Essence, they can only have one per ability. They can choose to keep the modification to their ability, at the cost of 3 proficiency. If they are lowered past a previously unlocked upgrade, they keep this upgrade; The prof goes to Robin as payment. Upon modification, Robin or the holder of said ability can change what the ability is called and it’s description, so long as it remains within the confines of what the original ability did, and how it was modified. [An example of a modified ability is: Should someone have a basic ability that lets them attack 3 times with their sword. Robin can add the Essence of someone who has fire-related abilities. Which lets the modified ability set people on fire as a result.]"
passive,Robin,Sponsorship Deal,,,"At the start of a session, Robin may decide to enter a sponsorship deal with DBA itself! Showing off more of the contestant’s kit while keeping it to the regular party format. Probably to increase ratings or some shit. Robin may pick one character who he has met before to take temporary Essence from. This is only limited to people within his class or lower, and does not require them to be in the session. If he crits while using the ability or basic attack this essence is connected to, or crits on a roll that relates to a talent or passive he’s using. He gets to keep it. The essence fades at the end of the session should he not crit with it."
ability,Robin,Give a Lil’ Love,X,,"Robin stabs an adjacent enemy (or ally) with his B.I.T.C.H. and extracts a Essence from their kit. This Essence can be used instantly to modify his or another adjacent ally’s kit in some way by taking out a component of one of their abilities, passives or talents. This also gives the target disadvantage on using that ability for the next 3 rounds, or disabling their passive or talent for 1 round. However, he can reduce the cost by 1 on allies, no longer giving the disadvantage or damage from being fucking stabbed. Whatever is taken as a result of the Essence extraction is returned at the end of combat. [Empty Mod Slot] [Empty Mod Slot]"

weapon,Gushka,Mhm Yes Yes Go Deal With Them,,,Now I SAY GO DEAL WITH THEM NOW. They are not worth my time. I say summoning 3 drogs from the pond should be enough. It seems as tho if I were to have 3 or more drogs I am only able to summon 1 with this order and if I have 2 I am only able to summon 2. That is a shame but I can always command 6 drogs at once with this attack and they are able to move half their movement in order to get there. The summoning can only trigger once per turn a shame.
talent,Gushka,You Wish to Pledge Fealty to me?,,,"Good good. That is good. Pledging Fealty to the one and only KING OF THE POND. This doesn’t really mean much besides ME gaining 1 Companionship with them at the end of a combat fore every combat we partake in. As well as me being able to command you to do an action for me if I spend a rolled movement action that happens to get above a 15. The bonds between the knights and ME, Doppel Gushka KING OF THE POND, are only furthered by their continued support of me, Doppel Gushka. Whenever I would gain more than five Companionship with one of my dear knights they are treated as a Drog for the purposes of determining whether or not I may command them in ways other than my movement actions although I must still roll over the DC in order to successfully command them in specific. Every five points of Companionship further gained, decreases the DC required to command a knight of mine by three for every five points past five Companionship and my knights now gain Companionship with me whenever I would critically succeed on commanding them or they would critically succeed on following my commands."
talent,Gushka,Rippling Droplets,,,Whenever one of my beautiful drogs would be defeated I may choose to give them another chance and pay an amount of stamina equal to the excess damage to have them return to a point of my choosing within The Pond as long as there is available space and have their debuffs cleared. This does not work on defeated knights. TIS A SHAME
passive,Gushka,THE POND,,,Ahhh yes the pond will never leave its king yes yes. It seems as though the pond isn’t as big here as it is back home BUT NO MATTER. I shall use this 1 square radius circle around me as the pond yes yes. All of my attacks and abilities seem to originate from the pond and it seems as though if someone were to be within the pond I have a +5 to rolls targeting them. THAT IS QUITE KINGLY INDEED. WHAT IS NOT KINGLY IS FORCING PEOPLE TO ENTER MY POND THROUGH MOVEMENT ALONE NO NO. If one wants to enter the pond they must do so willingly. I cannot force them to do that. The pond can seem to pass through allies HOWEVER I CANNOT END MY TURN WITH AN ALLY IN THE POND. The pond also seems to grow by 1 whenever 3 actions are successfully done within the pond besides actions done by drogs besides myself. Yes Yes this pond will suffice for now. Also 1d4 drogs spawn within the pond at the start of my turn.
passive,Gushka,Progenitor Drog,,,"Yes yes the drogs they come from me you know. The thing is a lot of them may come out at once and more may come in the future HOWEVER drogs unless they are special really just have a mind of their own and I cannot always control them. My attacks and abilities have a max amount of drogs that can be affected. ALSO for the sake of mechanics all of my actions/abilities are bonus actions however I cannot take a main action in any capacity. However if i were to use more than one bonus action a turn I have to pay an additional stamina for every bonus action I take after. The stamina resets at the start of my turn yes yes. Also Drogs once they are given an action they cannot be used again on the turn they have been given the action. Also unless otherwise specified Drogs only have 1 stamina, 1 damage 1 range attack and 3 movement. They also tend to take damage easier than most creatures and are typically smaller creatures. ALSO a good King and better general must always be aware of the conditions of their forces. I may choose to see from the location of any single drog or knight I am commanding at a time as a free action on my turn. I gain all-around vision around the target however they can only see up to a number of spaces away equal to the current size of The Pond. Whatever I view is enshrouded by a thin shadowy veil that lightly obscures."
passive,Gushka,You Wish To Thin My Hoards…? That Simply Won’t Do.,,,"Yes, yes… A King is nothing without their soldiers. You will not cull them without my permission. Whenever my valiant drogs would be subject to an area of effect attack, several attacks in quick succession such as an attack rush, or suitibly similar methods of attack adept at running through weaker creatures the individual damage, or damage that would normally be applied to each individual, may instead be subtracted from my current Morale, which is a pool equal to the combined stamina total of all of my drogs. Whenever enough damage would be dealt to defeat one of the drogs affected then the lowest power drog is defeated first and any excess damage is applied to the next applicable target, continuing until the damage is dealt in full, however each affected target will always must always take a minimum of one damage."
ability,Gushka,Mass Coordination,1+X,,"Yes yes now is the time to strike my drogs! All of you attack the closest enemy next to you if you are able to! If you are not able to then TOO BAD. I may use you for something else. I also pay an additional X amount of stamina equal to half the amount of drogs that are above my normal command limit (basic attack). Also when I would use Mass Coordination is used to attack an individual target and at least half of the adjacent spaces around my ENEMY are occupied by or threatened by my drogs then the damage dealt to them is combined together for the sakes of overcoming defenses such as damage reduction, resistances, thresholds, and similar things and the total damage is increased by one per commanded drog."
ability,Gushka,Drog Drog Evolution,2,,You see you see the thing about me and my drogs is that we are the cockroaches of the shadowrealm. We may die very easily but we are able to adapt and evolve to help us gain advantage in our fights! I DO NOT CARE IF COCKROACHES DO NOT DIE EASILY DO NOT QUESTION THE KING. So if up to 4 drogs are close to things that could potentially give them an advantage they are able to take it back to the pond to have the next 2d4 drogs summoned to have an effect based on the things. If multiple drogs are required to LIFT THINGS then THE DROGS WILL LIFT. If i also happen to have any knights I can take aspects from them instead! However the drogs still have to have to drag said knight to the pond.
ability,Gushka,Drogtectors,2!,,You DARE attack the king of the pond? How dare you. DROGS take the hit for me. Yes yes just jump in the way and hopefully enough of you will be able to protect me from whatever is attacking me. 
weapon,Talus,Flesh of the Fallen,,,"Your body has heavily necrotic energies radiating from it and a mere touch causes an aversion from the living. Melee range 6 damage against living targets 4 damage against artificial/undead. [8] - + 1 damage to both (5 to 6, 3 to 4)"
weapon,Talus,Gravebound Style: Fist of Decay,,,"5 damage melee range. A strike from this attack saps the necrotic energy within an undead, and suffuses it within the attacker. This deals +1 damage to undead creatures, and -1 damage to the living or constructs. If used against the undead you may choose to either recover 1 stamina (if the practitioner is themself, some sort of an undead, if not you would take one damage), or have their arm cloaked in necrotic energy granting an additional +1 damage to their next attack with that hand."
talent,Talus,One Life Run; No Resets,,,If you go unconscious during a session you disappear and the session is now over for you. 12 - If you manage to survive a full session without being forced out by being knocked unconscious you may gain 1d2 stamina or proficiency.
talent,Talus,Neverending Pace,,,"You have a second move action per round that you can specifically only take on other people’s turns, you can choose to only take part of that movement across multiple turns. If you try to move as a reaction to something you have to roll for effectiveness with the roll being harder the less movement you spend on getting out of the way."
talent,Talus,Oxygen Deficient,,,"While he doesn’t have an enhanced lung capacity or anything of the like, Talus can ignore the penalties of suffocation or drowning and other organ failures not centered within the brain for upwards of ten minutes (in-universe) before it starts to take a real toll on his body."
passive,Talus,Son of Envy,,,"Jealousy. Jealousy of the living, the dead, and everything that you are not is a constant emotion in your brain. No one knows what you are going through and they cannot hope to even begin to understand. They should appreciate the life they are living. If they cannot appreciate it then you are the one who should show them what true suffering and pain feels like. You have +1 to damage against those who openly state that they hate the life and bliss they are living. "
ability,Talus,Path to Destruction,1!,,"“All roads lead to It. Death takes us All.” Everyone is so very slow. And while your body might not be fast all you need are your senses to follow the stench of Death to come. Upon activation roll 1d8 to determine the amount of tiles and move that many spaces (you may pass through enemies by using this). The spaces you have traveled through are now difficult terrain for everyone but you for the next two turns. Three times per round, each time you use this in a round its cost is multiplied by 1.5x rounding up. (so 1, 3, 5) [16] - Remove its random direction factor. [43] - The die size of path to destruction is equal to your movement speed"
ability,Talus,Pain Index,3,,"“What is Bliss? Nothing but a child’s Dream.” Every fiber of your body cries in every movement you make. You know exactly how each part of the body can hurt in the harshest of ways. Make a basic attack against a specific body part for 1.5x the damage and a crippling debuff relevant to where you attacked. If you critically succeed it will do a total of 3x the normal damage and render that body part completely unusable for the remainder of combat. Again 24 -  If Pain Index would fail Talus realises that he was putting too much effort, inflicting pain is a simple matter in which his precision isn’t required and thus may choose to take a normal basic attack with +1 crit range at the cost of an additional point of stamina."
ability,Talus,Torture Tantrum,1⛯,,"“All I know is Pain. Pain is my Reality.” Living such a life has pushed your mental state to the brink and sometimes… you willingly step over the line. While this ability is active you can only take damaging actions and you now impose disadvantage on all anytimes that try to help or hurt you, Talus is also considered as an enemy. Your movement speed increases by 2. If there are no enemies within movement range when you start your turn you must instead target the closest entity for your turn’s action. You deal one third of your missing stamina(rounding down) as extra damage. Upkeep cost of two. Once per combat."
ability,Talus,Agony Render,2,,"“An eternity in every Second. That is my Burden” You are one with no soul and exist in a way in which none can properly relate to you. You’ve tried explaining what it’s like living in this hell before but no one seems to understand it. Not unless you make them. But then there’s all the screaming which hurts your ears even more than usual. Briefly rip out a piece of the soul of a target within 3 spaces before it gets drawn immediately back in. For the moment in which the soul fragment is removed that target feels what you feel, understands that which you are going through. And for that brief instant glimpse into your insanity they take 6 damage that is either psychic or soul based, whichever would be more effective. The brief energy that you gain from the soul gives you one of three things: a slight buff based on the person you targeted to your next action, 1 healing, 2 squares of movement to be taken now."
ability,Talus,"From Flesh to Flesh, From Dust to Dust",2,,"“All we are is dust in the wind. The wind of a never-ending gale.” Talus can only use this after he has used Agony Render. This ability is a free action. With the piece of soul he takes from the target and some of his own flesh he can create a simulacrum of existence. The small creature is a pitiful existence, much in the same way as Talus, but it is not a real entity, it has no thoughts, no feelings, it exists only as a marriage of an abomination and something closer to a normal existence. It has 3 stamina, 1 movement speed, and a 2 damage basic attack. It has access to Never-ending pace, Agony Render, and a custom effect based on the soul of the one animating it. This ability is paid for in both current and max stamina, which is recovered at the end of the session. The summon is capable of acting immediately upon creation. These summons do not disappear at the end of combat, unless destroyed."
weapon,Celia,Caeus Claws,,,The claws inherent with her suit make the perfect assassination tool for Celia’s needs. This weapon deals 3x damage on a crit. Can only be used while Caeus Armor: Stealth is active. 4 Damage 1 Range.
weapon,Celia,Ascia,,,"Not needing the mist spread across the arena, Celia coalesces it into her own unique weapon: the giant double-bladed axe Ascia, perfect for overwhelming her opponents. Can only be used while Caeus Armor: Time is active. 6 Damage 2 Range."
talent,Celia,In the Mist,,,"If she wishes, Celia may spend 1 stamina in order to teleport instead of moving normally when she takes a movement action."
passive,Celia,Caeus Armor: Stealth,,,"A strange mist seems to sit around Celia constantly, no matter where she goes, and most of it coalesces around her body as a sort of armor. In combat this seems to fill the entire arena with a light mist, but out of combat it is more focused into a roughly 5ft aura around her. While this doesn’t give her any defensive benefits, as a movement or standard action Celia can become “stealthed”, seeming to become enveloped within the surrounding mist. Her form is difficult to make out, but there. Unless the enemy has extremely good perception or some other way to track her, attacks directed at Celia while she is stealthed have a 1/4 miss chance and roll with disadvantage (crits override both miss chance and disadvantage). Furthermore, if she attacks while stealthed the attack has advantage and deals an additional 1d4 damage after all other modifiers, however unless otherwise specified doing so will immediately remove her from stealth. Furthermore, she cannot become stealthed on the same turn it is removed."
passive,Celia,Caeus Armor: Time,,,"While stealth is her friend, in times where she needs to get into direct combat Celia will sometimes focus her epithet into a separate mode, one focused on manipulating hers and others’ perceptions of time. She can swap between armor modes as a free action on her turn, but only once per turn. In this form her armor bulks up a bit and the mist becomes focused in a 10ft aura around her at all times. While this is active, Celia gains a once per round anytime dodge against attacks originating within her aura. Whenever she successfully dodges an attack from an enemy within her aura, everything seems to slow down to her, while to her enemies her speed seems to only increase, giving her +1 crit range. This maxes at +3 crit range, only applies while Caeus Armor: Time is actie, and resets at the end of combat. Furthermore, while in this form she may take one action at halved effectiveness as a bonus action if her first action succeeds."
ability,Celia,Wavering Form,1⛯,,"Celia and some of the mist around her seems to waver and wobble around, becoming indistinct and indistinguishable from each other as 2 misty clones are formed within her movement range. Celia must choose one of the 3 existing forms to be the real her, while the others are simply illusions created by the mist. All 3 may move on her turn, but only one may take actions per turn. Clones dissipate after being hit by an attack once. Once per combat. Stealth: Upon use of this ability, both Celia and the two clones are considered to be stealthed, and will not become un-stealthed until both clones are removed. Time: The second bonus action granted in this form may be taken by any of the clones, regardless of which took the main action, and all 3 have a once per round anytime dodge. 33: Wavering Form Upgrade: When using Wavering Form, Celia may choose one of the 3 forms to be in the opposite stance instead, following the relevant rules. She may only do this if she did not already switch forms this turn."
ability,Celia,Bolt from the Mist,1,,"Out of somewhere with Celia’s mist, sudden bolts form and launch out. Deals 3 damage to up to 3 different targets within 4 spaces of Celia and links them to her, forcing them to make a resist roll or spend a standard or movement action to remove the bolt in order to move farther than 4 spaces from her. If she moves away, linked targets are dragged with her unless she breaks the link. Stealth: Celia may choose the origin point of the bolts to be anywhere within 6 spaces of herself, linking the targets to that spot instead of to her (all targets must still be within 4 spaces of her).Time: To anyone hit with this ability, Celia seems to be significantly faster while the bolt is still in them, giving her advantage to attacking those targets."
ability,Celia,Adaptive Function: Stealth,3,,"Celia quickly slices at a target before escaping back into the mist, leaving her enemies confused about her exact location. This attack deals 6 damage, doesn’t break stealth, and can be used in the middle of a movement action."
ability,Celia,Adaptive Function: Time,1,,"With a hefty swing of Ascia, Celia launches a target into the air while dealing her basic attack damage and leaving them in the air until their next turn, where they fall to the ground and start the turn prone. If the target is hit by some force or attack before landing on the ground, they’ll suffer 2-4 knockback along with any other effects of the attack."
ability,Celia,Misty Step,1!,,"Briefly allowing her epithet to take over and becoming a form of mist, Celia appears on another space within her mist up to a max of 4 spaces away, leaving behind a misty double to take the attack for her. If she successfully avoids an attack with this, Celia immediately becomes stealthed if in Caeus Armor: Stealth, or immediately gets +1 crit range and may attempt a basic attack if in Caeus Armor: Time. Once per round."
weapon,Yig,Entangling Grasp,,,"As a bonus action Yig sends study roots below the ground of the current combat arena itself targeting a target within 10 miles of them. The roots then erupt out of the earth and kind of hang out and whatnot. As a main action Yig can attempt to control 1d3+1 roots and have them restrain targets, the targets then cannot move more than 2 spaces from the roots. If a target moves more than 2 spaces away from the root they have to roll and if they beat the roll of the main action they manage to break free and lose 2 movement the roots still persist and can re-attach themselves to a target if yig uses a main action again, if they fail the roll their turn immediately ends as the roots tighten and constrict themselves disallowing you to take any form of action till the end of your turn. The DC to escape halves after each attempt. These roots are considered to have the same regenerative capabilities as the roots from Yig’s passive. The roots themselves don’t deal any damage initially but at the end of each of the opponent's turns they deal 1 damage to them and heal 2 different allies for 1 stamina. The roots can be repositioned to a space within 2 spaces of them at the start of Yig’s turn."
weapon,Yig,Simulation! ,,,Yig can heal a target for whatever their current amount of healing from Mycorrhiza would be plus 2!
talent,Yig,Bionetworking,,,"Yig may be able to naturally heal others but he has his limits as to how much a single person can benefit from him. When an ally would be healed by Yig’s healing or healing influenced by Yig’s kit and would go over the 75%, 50%, or 25% thresholds by one instance of healing they instead heal to the designated threshold. The excess healing is called ‘Phloem’. Phloem can then be converted into something else that would be beneficial for the character besides healing. This can be anything ranging from a roll buff or helping the character with some kind of debuff to DR to giving the character their red stat. The actual excess healing itself goes to the next lowest party member percentage wise connected to Yig’s roots. This can trigger multiple times per turn.The Phloem can be exchanged as follows: 5 Phloem -  - 1 to all stamina costs (maximum of minus 2, cannot go below 0) 4 Phloem - 1 DR (maximum of 2DR) 3 Phloem - + 1 to damage (maximum of plus 3) 2 Phloem - + 1 to rolls (maximum of plus 4) 1 Phloem - + 1 to movement (maximum of movement equal to the individuals build) People can still benefit from Yig’s passive if they use the movement given by this talent, just cannot use movement of their own. Individuals do not need to exchange Phloem for these things in particular, it can be something else entirely that just isn’t healing."
passive,Yig,Mycorrhiza,,,"A number of very small roots seem to constantly grow out of the bottom of Yig’s cloak. These roots connect to Yig’s allies at the start of the session and seemingly can extend a very, very long distance. When an ally is connected to the roots they have an opportunity to heal at the end of their turn if they don’t move from their current position. If an ally does not move they heal for 1% of their max stamina (rounding up) if they are below 75% stamina, heal for 5% of their max stamina (rounding up) if they are below 50% stamina or 10% of their max stamina if they are below 25% stamina. If an ally were to be below 0% stamina, Yig can once per combat per ally bring them to 0 instead when this healing would trigger. If Yig’s roots were to be damaged or severed in any way the roots immediately regrow and reattach and Yig takes ¼ of the damage that would have been dealt to the roots."
ability,Yig,Mutualistic Ecosystem,X!,,Oh no Yig notices an ally just got fucking dunked on by an enemy attack! Let’s spread that pain around! The roots on an ally digs into them as 1/X  of the damage can be shared with another person affected by Mycorrhiza as it travels through the roots to the individual(s) taking the damage for them. X is equal to the amount of people willing to share the damage. To those who share the damage they can benefit from Bionetworking treating half of the damage they took as Phloem.
ability,Yig,Spread of Nutrients,3,,"Yig notices an ally in danger and forces the healing from his passive to take action immediately! The target heals stamina from healing that they would heal from Mycorrhiza and whatever the number is, it is doubled. "
ability,Yig,ROOTJUTSU,1!,,Yig focuses on their roots from their basic attack currently in play and has them do a thing. This can be anything from moving someone around within his roots to having them pick up a big rock. Once per round.
weapon,Eda,Vasilissa,,,"A unique sword crafted specifically for Eda by The Sakura Estate. It has an odd shape with the hilt and sheath containing various types of insect eggs. Since Eda does not possess much physical strength it only deals 2 damage at 1 range. However it does have other functions, when she infuses it with Wisteria she can choose to either just attack with it, rolling with advantage, or she may instead attack with it but instead of afflicting the target with her poisons she summons one of her insects to act as a summon. These summons may only use the poison that Eda gave them when she summoned them. She may only have a total of 3 of these summons out at a time, though she may have several instances of a single one out, unless stated otherwise. Eda’s insects do not restore Wisteria naturally. It only costs her half of the normal Wisteria (rounding up) to infuse insects with poisons of her choice, though the insects must pay the normal amount. They do not spend the stamina however when they do it. Ant (XW 2S) - When summoned roll a d6+4, this is how many ants are summoned. Ants have 1 Max Stamina and 2 Wisteria. Ants deal 0.5 damage (rounding up) at 1 range and can act immediately when summoned. When an ant is attacked at melee range, all other ants not only gain advantage to attack the aggressor but also all other ants in melee range get an immediate attack. Ants have 7 movement. Beetle (XW 4S) - The beetle is the defensive boy. Beetles have 10 Max Stamina and 2 Wisteria. They have a 2 damage 1 range basic attack that can move a unit up to 2 spaces away from it. Beetles have 2DR and a once per round 1 cost anytime that can redirect any attack that passes within 3 spaces of it towards themselves. Beetles have 3 movement. Butterfly (1W 3S) - Butterflies are fragile but useful in spreading poisons. Butterflies have 4 Max Stamina and 4 Wisteria. Their basic attack spreads a fine powder in a 3x3 area around them that deals 2 damage to all units, they can apply poison to this and they are the only insect Eda has that has access to all of her poisons except Talafilum. Butterflies have 6 movement and are always flying. Spider (XW 4S) - Spiders are technically arachnids but Eda loves them anyway. Spiders are useful at setting traps. Spiders have 8 Max Stamina and 3 Wisteria. And unlike her other summons the spider regens 1 Wisteria at the start of Eda’s turns. As a main action spiders are able to lay down 3x3 webs that are saturated in either one of Eda’s poisons or their own poison, that deals 3 damage at the start of the unit’s turns. The webs are difficult terrain. And as a once per round 1 cost anytime the spider is able to utilise their thread control to manipulate the webs to perform a simple action, though they may not move any webs once they have been paced. Spiders have 5 movement, unless it is over webs in which case it is doubled. Wasp (XW 5S) - Wasps are the primary damage dealers of Eda’s insects. They have 3 Max Stamina and 5 Wisteria. Wasps have a 5 damage melee range basic attack that pierces all forms of DR and is hard to counter. They can fly and have a movement of 5. Only 2 Wasps may be summoned at a time."
talent,Eda,Get Stickbugged,,,"Eda is surprisingly good at hiding her presence and assassination! She gets a +2 to all stealth checks and gains a +3 to rolls when attacking from stealth with a +1 to damage. In addition she has retooled all of her poisons to be ever changing, corrosive and more potent, this allows them to bypass resistances to poison making it of normal effectiveness and turning immunities into mere resistance."
talent,Eda,The No-No Juice,,,"Eda’s body is so saturated with toxins that her blood has been permanently changed. Whenever anyone ingests her blood they roll a dX (where X is equal to the amount of toxins her body contains) and they are afflicted with it now. This reduces Eda’s current Wisteria by 2 (down to a minimum of 0), regardless of the type of toxin it was, and her maximum Wisteria is lowered until the end of combat by 1. In addition, blood loss is a lot scarier for her since it’s harder for her body to produce more and so she also starts losing 1 stamina at the start of all of her turns which increases by 1 each time this happens in a session until the end of the session (but not out of combat). This is considered irreducible and can only be cured by something that gives her body more blood. Eda starts combat with maximum Wisteria."
talent,Eda,Have You Seen My Cute BUGS!?!,,,"Eda may be a mass of toxin and toxicity, but that’s just her body! She herself is super perky and charming. She gains a +2 to charisma checks and +1 companionship the first time she gains companionship with someone. She can also now speak to her own insects and gain information through them, though the more there are the less it can be interpreted or seen, it barely works at all with ants regardless of how many there are."
passive,Eda,A Body of Poison and Curse,,,"Eda’s body is in a constant near-death state, teeming with all sorts of poisons and toxins right down to her cells. Their red stat, known as Wisteria, represents how saturated with substances their body is, and they can use Wisteria to modify their own actions and on the insects they create with Vasilissa by spending some of both Wisteria and Stamina. Wisteria has a maximum of 10 and Eda regains 1 at the start of her turn. Obviously this makes them completely and utterly immune to almost every single standard poisonous or toxic substance. Though any more unique or new poisons and toxins they encounter they have a high resistance too and may make a roll to add that substance to their body permanently, allowing them to use it in the future and increase their maximum red stat by 3. If the roll fails they may force it to succeed by spending 3 maximum stamina permanently. Due to her nature and experimentations all of the toxins and poisons are considered unique in nature, it is also possible for her to stop these from becoming fatal if she so desires. Bataxicthoron (3W 3S) - A deadly and near fatal poison that is most commonly found in certain types of frogs and insects. This poison attacks the victim’s nervous system forcing them to spend an extra 1 stamina cost on everything (including actions that don’t usually cost stamina) for every instance of Bataxicthoron they have been afflicted by. Once a victim has been afflicted by Bataxicthoron 5 times they immediately take ⅕ of their maximum stamina as damage (rounded down). Though once this occurs they are cleared of the status. Cryrume (2W 2S) - A deadly and near fatal poison that is most commonly found within certain metals and ores. This poison attacks the victim’s motor controls, vision and hearing that not only affects their movement, reducing it by 1 for every instance they have been afflicted by this, but also this decreases all of their ranges by 1 for every instance they have been afflicted by this. This can only go down to a minimum of 0. Once a victim has been afflicted by Cryrume enough times to reduce their movement to 0 they are cleared of this status at the end of their next turn but their movement is reduced by 1 permanently until the end of combat, though their movement cannot be permanently reduced through this method for the rest of combat. Decayin (5W 1S) - A deadly and near fatal poison that is most commonly found within certain plants and nuts. This poison attacks the victim's entire body but attacks in stages even more so than the other poisons. After the first instance of being afflicted by Decayin the victim will start to feel dizzy, this forces their first space movement on their turn and after any action they take to be randomly determined by a d8. The second instance also reduces their physical damage they deal by 1. The third instance forces their first 3 spaces of movement to be random. The fourth instance reduces all of their damage by 3 (including the previous reduction). The fifth and final instance forces the target into a state of near death, they cannot do any actions that cost stamina and their first action they take per round is rolled with disadvantage. The stamina cost for this increases by 1 each time it is inflicted upon the same target. This state can only be cleared via something that clears debuffs or statuses and does not clear in other ways. Rescani (1W 3S) - A deadly and near fatal poison that is most commonly found within minerals and sulfur. This poison attacks the target's brain, affecting their cognitive abilities and causing various effects. Every time a victim is afflicted with Rescani they roll a d4. On a 1 they are afflicted with confusion which means that every time they take an action and roll a 7 or lower they target someone they did not wish to target and do so at near full effectiveness, the DC for failure is increased by 1 each time they are afflicted by this. On a 2 they start to feel sluggish and sleepy giving them a -1 to all action rolls for every time they are afflicted by this. On a 3 or 4 they take 2 damage as they start to be attacked by headaches, this damage is increased by 2 each time they are afflicted by this one. This one can only be inflicted 5 times before it is cleared after the victim’s next turn. Each instance of affliction rolls a separate d3. Talafilum (XW 2S) - A special type of gas that is neither fatal or deadly, it is a man-made substance. Talafilum is a special substance, when it comes into contact with poisons or toxins it takes on their properties and spreads it out in a gaseous form. When using any of her other poisons, Eda can spend 1 Wisteria and 2 Stamina to also apply Talafilum to it, making that poison cover a wider area and afflict more units, at base it becomes a 3x3 area but she can pay more Wisteria to increase the size category by 1, the Wisteria cost is always +1 of what the previous increase was. For example; if she were to want to make Cryrume cover a 5x5 area she would need to pay 8 Wisteria and 4 Stamina."
ability,Eda,Dancing Butterflies: Original Stance - Bug Barrage,X,,"An original stance on Eda’s Dancing Butterflies sword style. Pointing her sword out away from her she moves it in a sweeping motion, anyone adjacent to her in a 3x1 space takes 2 damage but most importantly she immediately fires out 2 of her insects up to 5 spaces away and they get an immediate action. The cost for this is determined by how much each insect costs and how much any poisons she needs to spend cost +1 Stamina cost. "
ability,Eda,Wisteria Seeda,3,,"Taking in a deep breath, Eda calms herself and immediately saturates her body with Wisteria. Using this ability grants her 2d4+2 Wisteria (this cannot go above her max). This cannot fail unless she crit fails, in which case she only regains 1d2+2 Wisteria. "
ability,Eda,Dancing Butterflies: First Stance - Three Sting Assault,1+X,,"Pointing her sword at her target, Eda moves up to 3 spaces and stabs at them 3 times with Vasilissa. This not only deals it’s weapon damage but also inflicts them with her passive 3 times so long as she can pay the Wisteria and the Stamina costs though the stamina is reduced by 1. She cannot summon her insects with this ability. Third Time’s The Charm - Whenever Eda uses this ability, she can choose to roll again when making the third strike and put more power into it which could increase damage, and, on a critical success, allow her to summon an insect if her choice so long as she can pay the cost. This is risky however, and on a failure not only does the third strike not happen but she stumbles slightly and the next enemy unit to target her does so with a +3, on a critical failure it is harsher but up to the GM. This roll is done with a d20 but has a defined success and failure range. 3 and below is a critical failure, 8 and below is a normal failure, 9-15 is a normal success and 16+ is a critical success. "
ability,Eda,Dancing Butterflies: Second Stance - Firefly Flash,2!,,With a blinding flash of purple light Eda disappears and as though by magic. In reality it is just her moving at an extreme speed. But her target immediately takes Vasilissa’s damage +3 with a 18+ crit range and Eda appears 1-3 spaces behind her target. Once per round. She cannot summon her insects with this ability.
weapon,Raen,Malleable Clay,,,A lump of magical Clay that can shape and harden into seemingly almost any tool/weapon Raen can think of.

talent,Raen,Mimicry is the Best Flattery,,,"Raen is able to perfectly replicate the voice, tics, and personality of people they are currently replicating. However they are unable to change their face so this is more of a party trick unless she gets creative."
passive,Raen,Best of Both Worlds,,,"Raen is able to use what's around them and work with what they got. When Raen touches a person they are able to replicate their powers and capabilities for the next 1d2 rounds. If the individual has more prof than Raen then their techniques that were acquired above Raen’s prof are scaled down. Raen can only have up to 3 abilities, one talent and one passive from other characters. They can only replicate from two unique individuals as well. If Raen has more prof than the person they are replicating from, they can change abilities and make their own abilities with the person’s powerset. Raen has some techniques of their own however they are all Once Per Combat and share the same Once Per Combat usage."
passive,Raen,A Fair Exchange,,,If something from Raen is copied or replicated in turn Raen is able to copy or replicate something from the person that copied from them. If the individual has copy protection they would have to lower it or they don’t get what they copied or replicated from Raen. Raen will keep the technique from the individual she’s copied until that individual loses what they copied from Raen. 
passive,Raen,Gonna Leave Yourself Open Like That Huh? ;3,,,"Whenever an incoming attack misses, Raen may spend 2 stamina and make a roll to move up to 2 spaces and, if she’s in range, tap them on the shoulder or somewhere on their body just to get their attention and make fun of them a little bit. This counts as a taunt, giving her +1 critical hit range until either the end of combat or until she next critically hits. If the incoming attack was a critical failure, then she doesn’t need to roll or spend stamina to do this."
ability,Raen,Two Heads are Better Than One,1⛯,,"A purpley reflection of Raen is put on the field within 6 spaces of her called her Miasma. Raen is able to have the Miasma move on her turn and have her abilities/attacks originate from the Miasma. As a 1 cost anytime action or an unrolled bonus action Raen is able to swap positions with the Miasma. If used as a main action this lasts for 4 rounds, if used as a movement she has to pay an additional stamina and this lasts for 2 + 1d2 rounds, if used as a bonus she has to pay an additional 2 stamina and this lasts for 1 + 1d3 rounds. Once Per Combat."
ability,Raen,Two for the Price of One,2⛯,,"Raen Flares her epithet as an additional purpley reflection appears behind her, called her Miasma. While the Miasma is out, all of Raen’s action economy is doubled in terms of actions required for abilities, passives and talents (Main, Movement [The second movement can only be used for abilities, passives and talent], Bonus) however all actions from Raen and the Miasma are halved in effectiveness (rounded down) in terms of numerical values. Effects that don’t have a numerical value tied to them are not halved in effectiveness. Raen and the Miasma are not allowed to repeat or do similar actions (aka they both can’t do a once per combat, use a basic attack, or do abilities that have a similar effect). This has a 2 stamina upkeep. This does not duplicate anytime economy. Once per Combat."
ability,Raen,Two of a Kind,3⛯,,"Raen takes in a deep breath and lets out a purpley mist around themselves, coating themselves in what they call their Miasma. While in this state Raen can pay 2 stamina to take an additional, Main, Movement, Bonus or Anytime action. Once a power has been used in this extra action economy way, Raen is unable to use the extra action economy for that power for the rest of Combat. Once per Combat"

talent,Tiamos,Who are You?,,,"Tiamos just genuinely has trouble recognizing people, man. Being pulled out of your timeline does that to you."
passive,Tiamos,I am From Ancient Greece,,,"At the start of a combat roll a 1d2. If Tiamos rolls a 1, it allows Tiamos to take aspects from ancient greek gods to affect and adjust Tiamos’ abilities and attacks in different ways. If Tiamos rolls a it 2 allows Tiamos take aspects from ancient greek titans to affect and adjust Tiamos’ abilities and attacks in different ways.

talent,Dusk Geist,Fraility of the Forgotten,,,"Geist’s body is weak and frail and made of straw. She suffers -1 movement when at 30 or less stamina, and additional -1s at 20 and 10. She also takes double fire damage. On the bright side, she’s very compact!"
passive,Dusk Geist,"Sticks, Stones, and Straw Bones",,,"Dusk Geist is an epithet, possessing a frail form of an old scarecrow from before The Sundering. Back when a humanoid figure was all you needed to keep the birds away. Because of this she is unbelievably frail and can’t naturally recover. Geist’s max stamina is capped at 31, and she does not recover stamina naturally between combats and sessions. Healing that doesn’t explicitly work on constructs is reduced to 1. However, she has a secondary stat known as her Halloween Spirit. At any point during her turn Dusk Geist may transfer Halloween Spirit into her stamina. Dusk Geist cannot spend stamina for epithet abilities, instead having to spend her Halloween Spirit. So long as Dusk Geist’s current Halloween Spirit exceeds her current stamina, she enters Trickster Spirit mode, in which her weapon and all of her abilities become dramatically stronger. Dusk Geist starts each session with 0 Halloween Spirit, but gains it equal to the damage she deals to enemies. She can keep Halloween Spirit between combats. Whenever Dusk Geist would upgrade her stamina, she may redirect it to upgrading her maximum Halloween Spirit."
ability,Dusk Geist,Tricking Beast,3,,"A person within your line of sight hears a bellowing message within their head… “trick or treat?” The target must choose: take an action as you outline immediately, or invite the ire of that which bewitches them, gaining 1d4 stacks of Curse which last for the rest of combat. Curse deals an amount of damage to the target equal to the stacks at the start of the victim’s turns, which counts as damage you’ve performed for gaining Halloween Spirit. The stacks also do not naturally decay or have a resist roll, they remain until the end of combat or until dispelled by an effect. TS: Should the person choose to invite the curse on them, a massive beast of the night appears out of Geist’s shadow and attacks the target for 3-15 damage."
ability,Dusk Geist,Lantern Curse,1!,,"Three phantom lanterns appear around a target. In three turns on initiative, the lanterns will collapse in on the target and deal 3 fire damage to the target. Should they attempt any action while the lanterns orbit them, they will immediately close in and detonate. If the roll for Lantern Curse is higher than their roll for the action that triggers it, that action is cancelled as well. Once per round. TS: The lanterns are replaced with five flaming jack-o-lantern heads cackling in unison. This now deals 5 fire damage and lasts for five turns instead of three."
ability,Dusk Geist,Murder of Crows,3,,"Geist calls upon a flock of shadowy crows to swarm. This creates a 3x3 area within 6 range that deals 3 damage initially to everyone within. Anyone who ends their turn in the area takes 3 damage, and for each space someone moves inside the area they take 1 damage. You can create multiple of these zones at once, though each has a 1 upkeep (which you pay for with Halloween Spirit). TS: The clouds are now filled with vampire bats, dealing an initial 6 damage. Each cloud also gains 2 movement."
weapon,Dallas,Samuela,,,A simple looking crowbar that is very very durable. It deals 5 damage at 1 range and it’s damage can be bludgeoning or piercing depending on how he is hitting the target. This can be used as a bonus action.
passive,Dallas,Immovable,,,"Your epithet is an extremely simple epithet. It can make you, or objects your touch, immovable. You, yourself are also considered immovable by any means unless you yourself want to move. When you make something immovable it typically lasts for a round while fighting and while not fighting it can last for up to a day. When making things very immovable it only lasts a fraction of a second. When making something immovable that doesn’t belong to you it lasts for only a couple of turns. The epithet itself will never intentionally make something so immovable to where it would cause over 6 damage to you or do a massive amount of damage to the planet itself. "
weapon,Stacy,Bitch Slap,,,Stacy Slaps a target dealing 4 damage and gives said target a -5 to use abilities against Stacy until the start of Stacy's next turn.
talent,Stacy,He's Mine,,,"Whenever someone tries to *flirt* or establish a connection that is more than just friends with targets affected by Stacy's passive, Stacy's epithet automatically activates and affects both people in a way that they feel the need to change the subject. If a target persists even through this the epithet subtly manifests and influences the perpetrator to stop."
talent,Stacy,A Healthy Relationship,,,Stacy can take an action on the turn of the target of her affection.
talent,Stacy,Till Death Do Us Part,,,When a target of Stacy's passive would be knocked out they are not knocked out and continue to fight until their body fails them.
talent,Stacy,My Little Puppet,,,The target of her affection is able to take a turn on Stacy's Turn instead of her or just a singular main action. Once per round.
passive,Stacy,Love is Fake,,,Stacy is able to subtly influence the people around her. The more time she spends with people the more they start to listen to her and do what she says. The more intimate the relationship the easier it is to influence people and the faster they are affected. In later stages everything she does viewed through the eyes of someone affected by this passive can only be perceived as good or caring. Even forms of abuse. This process however takes an extremely long time. For example it typically takes a year in order for someone to be somewhat easily influenced by Stacy. After 3 or 4 years said target essentially becomes a slave to Stacy and will obey and thing she tells them to do even things along the lines of taking their own life. If a target dies and is somehow brought back to life this passive resets on them. The affects of Stacy's epithet do not linger after she dies. |This process can be exponentially increased with physical abuse| Target an enemy to be the target of your affection. When an enemy is affected by this they have a -3 on rolls targeting stacy and are subject to some of her talents.

weapon,Apeigail,MILK SMASH,,,"Apeigail slams her forearms on 2 melee targets, dealing 4 damage to both."
talent,Apeigail,Slurp Slurp Slurp,,,Apeigail due to their epithet is literally just made out of milk and can be consumed by her allies to heal for up to 5 stamina. This obviously takes away from Apeigails stamina or max stamina at a 1 to 1 ratio. Enemies can also slurp from Apeigail if they are brave enough to do that.
passive,Apeigail,Aggressive Flavoring,,,Apegiail isn’t some kind of ordinary primate. She’s got milk. As a free action Apeigail can swap between any of her flavors. She can also swap to a different flavor as a 2 cost anytime twice per combat. This provides special defensive and offensive options to how attacks interact with her and attacks originating from her. Standard - Defensive: Whenever she is hit with an attack or ability milk splashes on every space adjacent to her making the tiles slippery causing people to trip and fall if they walk over the tile. Aggressive: If Apeigail targets a person that has been healed this combat the damage is increased by 3.

talent,Bobbi,Bismuth Being,,,"Bobbi counts as a “Bismuth Structure,” making her count as the Excelled build, and not be affected by things that harm the normal human body.

She will die of age after millions of years, but that’s a long time away."
talent,Bobbi,Bismuth Beholder,,,"Bobbi can hold and carry any bismuth object or construct, no matter how big or heavy it is and no matter how strong or weak she is."
talent,Bobbi,Every Rock Has Thorns,,,"The bismuth Bobbi creates is incredibly sharp, meaning all contact with bismuth structures deal 1 contact damage per touch."
passive,Bobbi,Radioactive Rock,,,"Despite seeming stable, bismuth is actually very slightly radioactive. However, when Bobbi is participating in a combat, or any other stressful/exciting scenarios, that property skyrockets to deadly levels. While in a combat, Bobbi gains a 2 space aura which is considered “deadly” before the radiation coming off of her peters back off to safe levels.

A color can only be used again after the other 2 colors have been used. Red - 6 Damage. Applies 1d3 Shock. Green - 4 Damage. Any targets caught in the blast are trapped within bismuth pillars and can either make a contested move action or an uncontested main action (Or perform some other sort of creative action) to break free. Blue - 8 Damage. All targets hit are pushed back 4 spaces in the direction of the beam. "

Karasu can sense magnetic fields! However, magnetic attacks deal +1 Mental Damage to Karasu, as it scrambles his internal magnetic sensors. He cannot speak, for he is a crow. He can mimic human speech though, and make a bunch of other funny noises! This talent cannot be changed, unless the source of this change is something that logically could alter the biological properties of a crow (Like Arezzo’s Epithet).

passive,Nick,I Dub Thee...,,,"As his turn’s bonus action Nick can give a person or item he can currently see and that can hear him a nickname or title. If the target already has a Nickname/popularly known and actively used title which he did not give, this effect is nullified. If he gives something a nickname he has already given a nickname the previous one is removed. The nickname must be accurate in some aspect, but it is entirely up to his own perception of the situation/thing. If the target is an object, then for as long as the nickname lasts the object’s properties lean further into that aspect, having an amplified effectiveness and bonuses to actions using that part/penalties for trying to ignore it. And for an individual, they may: spend 1 stamina to add their nickname as a slight effectiveness boost to an action they’re taking or spend 3 stamina at the start of their turns to gain a passive benefit for the round based on their nickname. Nick may freely cause nicknames to apply effects to the detriments of his targets without spending stamina if the nickname is applied to them. Nicknames are only cleared by epithet negating effects, Nick removing them, or Nick being rendered unconscious/end of combat."
ability,Nick,"My Epithet Isn’t Epithet, I Swear",2,,"Nick channels his epithet into someone with a nickname applied, and in doing so grants them a written out passive and ability for their nickname for as long as they keep it.

passive,Dr. Mönkhbat,The Lowest Failures Preceed the Greatest Triumphs,,,"Dr. Mönkhbat’s Epithet not only capitalizes on successful feats, but also tragic failures as well. If someone on the map fails an action, or is unable to successfully perform it (Such as being outcontested by a higher roll), they may choose to make that a Great Crit Failure, which acts as a 1.5x Crit Failure that can screw over whoever did it in extreme and cosmically coincidental ways. However, this then allows the unit to make a roll within the next round done with advantage, and if they roll a 19 or 20, they perform a Great Crit Success, which acts as a 1.5x Crit Success, which grants them prof. If the unit rolls a Natural 1, this automatically procs."
ability,Dr. Mönkhbat,Prisma Punch,3,,"A powerful punch, increased to its absolute peak by Dr. Mönkhbat’s Epithet. Not only does this deal 9 melee damage and 5 knockback, but it also can give whoever it hits a random trivial skill permanently."

ability,Dr. Mönkhbat,Power Balloon,3,,"Monkhbat’s power is so intense, just pushing it outside of him can create a well of immense energy that could burst at any second. A 3x3 area of pure energy begins to swell next to Dr. Mönkhbat to the point of bursting, and in 1d3 turns, that’s just what it will do. During this interim period where the energy ball is still intact, no one can move through it. Once it bursts, the ball expands into a 6x6 explosion and deals 7 damage to everyone within, and knocks everyone prone."
weapon,Queens,Vicious Claws,,,"A quick swipe from Queens’s long, curved, scythelike claws. 6 Damage 2 Range."
weapon,Queens,Crooked Lamp Post,,,"An old, bent, out of shape lamp post, that somehow manages to still glow. Queens never goes anywhere without it. Instead of damaging, Queens can opt to drag an opponent within its range closer to themselves. 3 Damage 4 Range."
talent,Queens,Frightening Form,,,"Queens has what one may call an odd and imposing frame. First off, their size makes them a 2x2. They gain a +3 to strength checks. Their claws allow them to scale and hang off of any surface. They gain +1 Reach (Their written kit features are assumed to account for this). Because they have seven eyes, they gain advantage on sight-based perception checks and darkvision. Due to their cloak obscuring their frame, the first time a unit uses a melee physical attack against them within a session, it rolls with disadvantage, as their cloak hides their very spindly body. This can be circumvented by one explicitly identifying/being able to pinpoint where Queens’s body is. As another weird quirk, Queens is able to switch between a variety of distinct voices. This talent cannot be removed or stolen unless tampering with the actual physical properties of Queens."
ability,Queens,"Sick ‘em, Clubbers!",1,,"Queens manifests some Clubbers, shadowy entities that normally party within The Royal’s Club. At base, Queens can summon 1d3+1 Clubbers. This number can be slightly decreased or slightly increased depending on the roll. The max amount of Clubbers that can be out at a time is 25. They have 5 Stamina, 5 movement, and a 4 damage punch basic attack.  If multiple Clubbers act together, they collectively roll, but with various buffs reflecting the group size. Up to 3 Clubbers/Clubber Groups can act within a turn. When defeated, they manifest back within The Royal’s Club and will be unable to be summoned for the rest of combat."
ability,Queens,Beerbending,X,,"Queens manifests some barrels full of liquor, which begin gushing out ludicrous volumes of the stuff. This is effectively a waterbending ability, but with alcoholic properties, as well as the manipulation of the barrels themselves. Queens can summon a max of 3 beer barrels in a single usage of the ability, which disappear after the ability resolves. X is dependant on the severity of the action itself."
ability,Queens,Hide Away,1!,,"Speakeasies were not a public sort of thing. Rather, they hid in the shadows, available only to those who knew about them. Similarly, Queens is able to hide themselves away when in danger, teleporting to any place on the map, provided it is out of sight from everyone on said map. Once per Round."
talent,Cathexis,Molten Maneuver,,,"Cathexis superheats a section of their body before making a simple strike, dealing 4 damage in melee and inflicting 1 LC Burn, which is instead 1 LC Greater Burn on a 19+."
passive,Cathexis,Flame is The Soul’s Breath,,,"Cathexis’ very being is inexorably tied to the flames that she spreads and emits, and as such she has a multitude of benefits granted as an extension of this. Particularly with her vessel of choice being an automaton which is powered by thermal energy she can increase her movement speed on her turn by spend upwards of 5 stamina as a free action, gaining +2 movement per point spent, she may also spend additional stamina when taking actions to incorporate flame control to her benefit cost being determined by the GM. The cost spent on this is tracked as points of Calefaction which may once per combat be spent all at once by venting the steam built up in her system as a bonus action as either a large movement jet action with variable effects beyond just the raw movement or large vision obstruction. "
passive,Cathexis,No Flame of Passion,,,"Cathexis cannot be affected by emotional based effects, due to the fact that she is entirely incapable of feeling them on a greater level. She is more or less entirely devoid of internal drive or wants, beyond the inherent “need” to eventually fix this part of herself."
ability,Cathexis,Only I Can Begin Forest Fires,3,,"Cathexis takes in a deep breath before exhaling a massive pillar of fire in a 20 foot 90° cone, dealing 5 damage to everyone within and afflicting them with a stack of Greater LC Burn. Anything flammable is immediately set on fire. Recharge 6 which is not immediately refreshed out of combat, each time this ability is used in a session the cost is increased by two, the range by 5 feet, the damage by 2, and the stacks of burn by 1. If the cost is 9 or higher this ability gains Split Second."
ability,Cathexis,Instant Transmission,1!,,"Cathexis can use this as her move action without taking up the anytime usage if she spends 2 stamina instead (unrolled). Cathexis moves and immediately appears in a space of her choice within 8 spaces or her current move speed, whichever is higher. She is still affected by whatever terrain would be in the way. Every third space she traveled through has a fire ignited on it, which deals 1 damage to those who move through it/start their turn there. Once per round. Split Second."
ability,Cathexis,"Ashing, The Neck Stabber",2,,"Bonus Action. Cathexis focuses and instantly any source of smoke and ash that she is aware of and/or can see solidifies into an object of her choice. If she uses her passive fire manipulation she can manifest this as an object directly in her possession by creating fumes specifically for using this. If she does so she may take an immediate follow-up action with this item. (8) Here. Hold This. - As a start of combat effect, Cathexis has an unrolled cast of Ashing, The Neck Stabber she can use immediately, either to keep for herself or give to an ally within reasonable distance. She still spends the stamina for this ability."
weapon,Zeus,Might of a Legend,,,"6 Damage 1 Range. Otherwise known as “Zeus’s Fists”. With the cracking of bone rivaling that of a thundercloud, Zeus delivers a nasty punch that hits like a truck and sends electric sensations throughout the body of the sucker hit by it. Inflicts 1 Shock. A Thundering Space is produced either on Zeus’s space or the space occupied by his target. Thundering: Lasting Legacy - A loud boom resonates from the Thundering Space, as the air force around it quickly expands out. This knocks all enemy units in or adjacent to the Thundering Space off balance, allowing Zeus or an adjacent ally to attempt to perform a Basic Attack on said unit(s) immediately. If Zeus uses Might of A Legend in this way, it does not produce Thundering Spaces."
weapon,Zeus,Thunderbolt,,,"4 Damage 5 Range. A classic. If you’re gonna have lightning powers, you gotta be able to do this. Zeus extends a hand and snaps, letting the sparks fly. Inflicts 2 Shock. Thundering Spaces are produced across the area this attack covers. Thundering: Strikes Twice - A crackling whistle emanates from the Thundering Spaces, dealing Thunderbolt’s damage as sonic damage that knocks hit units to the end of its area."
talent,Zeus,Been Around,,,"Zeus loves getting people’s attention, and boy has he. The amount of people he’s met and the places he’s been is frankly staggering; there’s a good chance that people have simply heard of the guy and his exploits from somewhere else. Maybe a tall tale of those with the name Zeus and his general attitude showing up in incredible circumstances? Maybe they met him a bar once and saw him do some stupid ass shit? Could be many things, but the point is that there are many people that are aware of this dude in some way, shape, or form. Zeus (or any of these people) are able to make checks in order to have others recall stories they may have heard, which may have varying effects."
talent,Zeus,Dramatic Entrance,,,"Wouldn’t be a fight without the theatrics! At the start of combat, before anyone else acts, Zeus can perform one immediate action to get things going his way! This action has to be something that Zeus thinks “makes him look cool”."
passive,Zeus,Very Very Frightening,,,"With every bolt of lightning comes a deafening crack of thunder; screaming to the world to be known. And why shouldn’t it? What’s the point of a spectacle if nobody knows it happened? Whenever Zeus successfully performs a Basic Attack or Ability, the air around him crackles and trembles, as specified spaces are marked as “Thundering Spaces”, as electrified, cloudlike particulates manifest and swell. On Zeus’s next turn after Thundering Spaces are marked, they explode with a boom of thunder as “Thundering Actions”: variations of each kit feature that can be released at any point on that turn at Anytime Speed. Thundering Actions do not need to be rolled for, unless they are being used to interrupt another action. After a Thundering Action is released, its associated Thundering Spaces dissipate."
ability,Zeus,Mjölnir’s Gravitas,4,,"A wicked grin crawls across Zeus’s face as he twists his entire body backwards, winding up as a massive build-up of electricity generates in his arm. Then, with the force of a natural disaster, he unleashes a devastating blow into an adjacent target, releasing the electricity into them and expelling it through the other side of their body. The hit target takes 10-15 hybrid physical and electric damage, is inflicted with 1d3 Shock, and is sent flying up to 8 spaces away. When using this ability, Zeus can move up to his Movement Speed in any direction, producing a lightning trail behind him as he zooms forward in an instant. In this case, any units between Zeus and his target get hit for 3-4 damage and are knocked to the side as he passes through them. A Thundering Space is produced on the space the target of this ability occupied when hit. Thundering: Turbine Aftershock - The air finally catches up to the full force of Zeus’s earlier punch, as a gigantic gust of wind overtakes a 5x10 area centered starting from the Thundering Space and in the direction Zeus’s punch sent the original target flying. This inflicts an incredibly hard to resist 10 spaces of knockback, and potentially variable damage depending on circumstance."
ability,Zeus,Almighty Tempest,3,,"Zeus dramatically swings an arm out in front of him, producing a thundercloud above a space of his choice within 10 of his current position, which then fires a lightning bolt down to the ground. This bolt deals 5 damage in a 3x3 area, and knocks all hit units up to 4 spaces away. However the bolt’s release can be held to be released on any turn up until Zeus’s next, and if this is done, its damage goes up by 1 for each held turn. If the bolt is centered on Zeus, the area it hits is extended to a 5x5, its damage gets increased by 5 at base, and it inflicts Dizzy on all hit units. Thundering Spaces are produced in the area the bolt hits. Thundering: Scorched Remains - In an instant, the Thundering Spaces detonate with an astounding crash, sending units inside the area up to 6 spaces in any direction (Zeus’s choice) with great force and momentum, dealing up to 5 damage in the process if Zeus desires. This also leaves the area aflame, causing all who enter (other than Zeus) to take 3 fire damage, as well as take an additional 1 for each space of it they move through. The area remains this way until Zeus dismisses the flames. (Prof 23) In A Flash - When using Almighty Tempest, Zeus can choose to immediately teleport to the area that the bolt strikes, you know, like a show-off. Similarly, he can choose to use Almighty Tempest as a Movement Action in this way although this causes its damage to be variably reduced."
ability,Zeus,Power Surge,1!,,"Extending his arms out to his sides in a flexing pose, a well of electricity explodes out of Zeus in an instant, overtaking his body and the surrounding 3x3 area in a torrent of volatile lightning. This deals 3-6 electric damage to all adjacent units and knocks them back 2 spaces, interrupting any actions they were performing. This can also block projectiles, as the lightning aura acts as a barrier. If desired, Zeus can additionally use this ability to empower another action he is performing, effectively acting as a secondary roll/effectiveness boost. Produces Thundering Spaces in the area this ability covers. Once per Round. Thundering: Resounding Impression - The electricity Zeus produced earlier still remains ambient, as with a thunderous boom, it springs alive again! Retaining the energy it came in contact with from its initial creation, an electric/sonic recreation of a unit/action the electric aura interacted with is manifested to produce a related effect! This has variable effectiveness."
ability,Zeus,Ride The Lightning,3,,"“Lemme take you for a ride!”. Zeus grabs onto an adjacent target, grappling them before taking to the sky with them! He is able to travel up to his Movement Speed in any direction before finally slamming his victim down onto the ground, a bolt of lightning sparking out skyward from them. This attack deals around 7-10 damage and knocks hit units Prone, along with dealing variable shockwave damage to any units they land on top of/adjacent to. However, this attack’s effectiveness is increased the further Zeus travels and the longer he remains airborne. Zeus is able to funnel his Movement into the distance traveled for this ability. Thundering Spaces are produced across the path that Zeus travels when using this ability. Thundering: Path Through The Storm - Tearing through the air like a knife, electrified wind manifests like a long tether across the area the Thundering Spaces encompass. On manifestation, these deal around 5 damage to anyone (other than Zeus) in their spaces, and for the rest of the turn, Zeus can use the tether as both a grind rail to move across without spending movement and/or as a literal tether he can grab and utilize as an Anytime Action."
weapon,Kaunoho,Oceanic Emperor,,,"Dedicated Object. A wood-carved trident, which when held by Kaunoho feels and acts exactly like a real one. It’s also passively unbreakable while being wielded by Kaunoho! Applies 1 Psyshock."
weapon,Kaunoho,Righteous Impact,,,A generic yet effective punch. 6 Damage 1 Range.
talent,Kaunoho,Amphibious Prince,,,"Kaunoho has doubled movement when swimming, and can hold his breath almost indefinitely (Though not forever)."
passive,Kaunoho,I Rule the Seas,,,"Manifesting the full power of ancient sea gods from various mythologies, Kaunoho can channel the power hydrokinesis and sea dominance through his trident! This effectively allows him to imbue waterbending into any of his actions, or spend a rolled Bonus Action and X Stamina to perform “General Waterbending” (X equals severity). Requires Oceanic Emperor."
ability,Kaunoho,Item Enforcer,X,,"Kaunoho channels a significant amount of generic force and esper power into an object he is touching. He then unleashes a psychic blast out from it. At base, this blast is launched up to 6 spaces away and deals around 5-7 damage. However, depending on what Kaunoho channeled this ability through will alter its properties significantly. X equals the severity, which is determined by the GM. The base DC for a minimum success for this attack is lowered to 4 when utilizing a Dedicated Object."
ability,Kaunoho,Hair Harm,1,,"Kaunoho imbues his hair with his blazing psychic power, allowing it to spring to life and attack! This can extend up to 3 spaces away, and can potentially attack targets for around 4 damage at base. Additionally, Kaunoho’s psychic influence on his hair gives it pseudo-burning effect if he wills it allowing him to selectively apply an additional 1d2 Psychic/Fire damage and 1d2 Psyshock. As a passive effect of this ability, Kaunoho’s hair effectively acts as an additional appendage that can grab and interact with stuff within its listed range."
weapon,Finale,Iconoclast,,,"A simple katana, built for function over form. It’s constructed of Anti-Epithet Titanium, a rare resource only certain people know how to cultivate. This means the blade is virtually indestructible, and cannot be altered or effected by epithet powers. It deals 9 damage at 1 range. Can only be swung once per round. [25 Prof] Chrysanthemum Style Forceful Blade - Finale can now swing Iconoclast more than once per round, however the first additional swing costs 2 stamina, and each swing afterwards that round doubles that cost exponentially (4 to 8 to 16 etc). Also, Iconoclast gains +1 damage."
weapon,Finale,Life-Stealing Claws,,,Claws given to you by your master. They are designed to help you survive your… combat style. These weapons deal 2 damage at 1 range and heal you for the damage they deal.
talent,Finale,Been To Hell And Back,,,Your stamina costs are now considered irreducible damage instead of cost. You are also utterly immune to effects caused by pain.
passive,Finale,Chrysanthemum Drive,,,"Strength is something you are born with. You are either strong or you are weak. That is the law of this world. Only through sacrifice can one transcend this law. All of Finale’s abilities are special in that their stamina costs become upkeep costs. Each one is equal to the initial cost of the ability and additively doubles every turn of yours. You may choose to deactivate these abilities by not paying their upkeep which resets the increase, however you cannot reactivate the ability on the same turn it was deactivated. This passive is needed to use anything else that comes from Finale’s kit, and your abilities cannot have their costs modified. All of this puts incredible strain on your body, but your master taught you a method to go one step beyond. In place of stamina, you may spend your own lifespan. A month equals one stamina point. You may also spend over the usual cost via this method, which each time you double the cost doubles the effect. You cannot spend a mix of stamina and lifespan. Every session (including ones you aren’t in) your lifespan decreases by the number of days that passed within the session, a minimum of one, with some extra possibly added."
passive,Finale,Blade of Eons,,,"By combining what she’s learned from her boss’ epithet with experimentation with the Chrysanthemum Drive fighting style, Finale can spend stamina to create weapons of pure lifeforce. These weapons have stats equal to the stamina paid for them, and only work for a single attack before dissipating. You can spend a maximum of thirty stamina on this. If a weapon is not used after a minute (10 rounds in combat, I don’t care if things work differently in DBA this is just an easy timeframe to use) it dissolves back into energy, returning the stamina (or lifespan) back to Finale. Missed attacks will still count and destroy the weapon."
ability,Finale,Godsight Drive,2,,"Finale strains their senses to the absolute extreme. This dilates her perception of time while also unlocking the limits of physically possible sight. While active Finale can see invisibility, see through illusions, and see hidden actions people take. Her eyes can also perceive higher beings and through planes, for example ghosts in the phantom plane. She gains advantage on all attacks she performs. In addition, she gains a free dodge roll whenever an attack is made against her. Should she roll higher than their attack roll, the attack will be completely dodged. Using your lifespan on this to double its effect gives you additional dodge rolls."
ability,Finale,Mithril Drive,X,,"Finale tenses her muscles, preparing them to rip and tear through targets at a moment’s notice. While active Finale adds +X to strength checks she makes. In addition, she deals +X damage with physical attacks. For every multiple of 3 that X is, she also gains +X critical hit range OR critical hit multiplier, her choice on how to divy them up before her roll."
ability,Finale,Vampire Drive,4,,"Your heart and vascular system becomes flooded with such unbelievable adrenaline that it begins to run dry of blood faster than it can create it. While active your attacks now steal the blood of others to go into yourself for either +2 stamina or 1/3rd the damage they deal rounding down, whichever is higher. You also gain +10 movement. Lastly, you gain +X damage on your turns, where X is 1/3rd the damage you took the past round rounding down."
ability,Finale,Lightyear Drive,3,,"Finale’s speed becomes absurd, pushing the limits of human possibility. While active your speed is multiplied by 1d4+1 times (rerolled every round). You also gain a +3 to dodge rolls you make and +2 damage with physical attacks. Lastly, when you attack with Iconoclast, you may use the attack while moving and move through enemies while doing so. If you do, you hit everyone you travel through with the attack."
weapon,Lua,Martial Palm,,,"A non-lethal martial art specializing in open handed bops. Deals 4 damage and 3 knockback at 1 range, is always considered non-lethal, and has Dexterous."
talent,Lua,Glimpses of The Future,,,"Lua not only has a weird relationship to space, but to time as well. Before any sessions (or other relevant things), she gets a single vague tip. This can be as general as a premonition that “something bad will happen”, or as specific as an out-of-context scene. In-universe, Lua is often unsure of the specifics or how real these are."
passive,Lua,Girl Stuck Out of Spacetime,,,"Lua’s power makes them slightly unstuck from reality, as if enveloped by existence but not quite within it. This gives her a lot of general benefits and advantages. For one, Lua is considered acausal. This makes her immune to temporal effects like retroactive causality or time stop. She is also considered as a part of her own space on the map, which mechanically translates as her always being considered as outside of any auras, terrain/environment effects, or continuous area effects. You are still affected by initial hits of AoE attacks, but not any lingering effects in the area. Lastly you can treat any surface you’re touching as your center of gravity, letting you run on any wall or object."
ability,Lua,Cognition Break,X,,"Lua extends her power as the “realness” of an adjacent object begins to be pulled away, dimensional cracks forming along the object as it buckles under the weight of nonexistence. This allows you to “break” an object, making one of its physical or metaphysical concepts work in a way it’s not supposed to, determined by you. You can only do this to an object once: trying again will delete it and Reality Crash any spaces it occupies. You can use this on people which can break an ability of theirs, but further uses simply deals damage instead of destroying them. Cost determined by the GM."
ability,Lua,Space Cleaver,1,,"Formed from dimensional boundaries, Lua creates a massive scythe-like energy weapon and swings it in front of her. This allows you to place 6-8 Reality Crash tiles onto the field, so long as one of them is no further than 2 spaces from you, none of them are further than 6 spaces from you, and they are all adjacent to another tile created from this action."
ability,Lua,Oblivion Dip,2!,,"Upon activation, Lua may fold themselves into an infinitely small pinprick of space. This allows them to teleport up to 6 spaces away, and Reality Crash the space they left from. Once per round."
weapon,Ceres,Firecracker,,,"A katana which Ceres can swing so fast that it creates sparks. This weapon deals 7 damage at 1 range of your choice of slashing or fire damage. Thanks to her epithet, Ceres can also substitute its damage type for psychic."
talent,Ceres,Defeatist Mindset,,,"Whenever Ceres lands an attack, you may pay X stamina once per combat. This also lowers Ceres’s maximum stamina for the rest of combat. The enemy gains that many stacks of Delirium. For the rest of combat, if their stamina is equal to or less than the number of Delirium stacks they have on them, then all stacks will explode dealing that much damage to them. Delirium stacks tick down by 1 automatically at the top of initiative."
passive,Ceres,Nightmare Fiction,,,"The echoes of trading blows is something one can feel for a lifetime after an encounter, permanently etched into one’s mind and body. Ceres’s epithet allows her to take on those memories, phantasmally altering themselves like their enemy. Whenever Ceres defeats a memorable enemy (as in lands the final blow) she may hold onto that image in her head, and at the end of the session she gains a Delusion Armament of that character. Delusion Armaments alter Ceres’s body, augmenting her powers to grant different abilities that are the same or similar to those it replicates. (I, zanza, will make these). Each one grants you three abilities and a passive. You can switch Delusion Armaments at the start of your turns. You can only remain in the same Delusion Armament for two rounds max. (List of Delusion Armaments on Ceres' character sheet https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niK6geqfUrp8d3MVhOrV2Qk0vPMMw7NzemwZQo0C2i4/edit?usp=sharing )"
ability,Ceres,Psycho Breaker,2,,"Bonus action. Ceres psyches herself up, allowing her to move-act-move and increase a single number for one of her Delusion Armament features by +1 to +3 depending on the roll for the rest of the round. Alternatively, she may sacrifice both of these buffs to instead have this move PUNCH someone adjacent to her for 4 damage at 1 range."
ability,Ceres,Hypothetical Onslaught,3,,"Your epithet flares out, shrouding the area in confusion as your body fades. Split into two phantasmal versions of yourself within 3 spaces of your original self. You must switch the Delusion Armament on one of them. Both of these versions can take however many actions you had remaining on this turn. However: only one of their effects actually happens. You get to roll for both and play out their turns, but choose which one you want to actually go through with as reality. You can choose this at any time, even after the actions have “finished resolving” and thus reactions can no longer be made for them. Until this is chosen the effects of their actions do not happen, but once chosen will happen retroactively. You must choose by the end of your turn. Due to the nocebo effect, damage can still be dealt by the “unreal” copy, though it is always reduced to 1 and typed as psychic. Once per turn. Bonus action."
ability,Ceres,Worst Case Scenario,0!,,"Upon landing an especially devastating blow with an attack, all who witnessed it are carried away by the fear of that strike, allowing Ceres to harness it for herself. This means that for the rest of combat, so long as that attack succeeds it deals at minimum the same effectiveness as when you used this ability on it. Once per round."
ability,Ceres,Confront Your Outer Demons,5⛯,,"Ceres stares down a single enemy, as all else vanishes around them. Both you and them are now considered incorporeal to others and unable to affect them, and visa versa. The both of you are given three rounds to fight each other, during which both of you only get one turn each round, and your initiatives are rerolled after each round. You have +1 damage, +1 movement, and do not spend stamina costs while this is active. These three rounds happen consecutively back-to-back, and after them the incorporeality effect ends and combat resumes from your initiative at the start of this ability. Once per combat."
