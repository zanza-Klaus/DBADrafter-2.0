weapon,Axel,Star Impact,,0,A basic jab directly at the enemy! Deals 7 damage at 1 range.
weapon,Axel,Shooting Star,,0,"Axel makes a finger gun with his hands, and from it fires a star-shaped projectile made of his epithet’s energy. Deals 3 damage at 5 range."
talent,Axel,Wheat Town Beatdown,,2,"Whenever Axel successfully lands a hit, he can immediately perform another action, so long as it isn’t an action he’s taken previously this turn. The damage of this following action is halved rounded up, and if that chains into another attack it gets halved again into 1/4th its damage rounded up, and so on. Critical hits bypass this damage proration and just deal double their base. ✪✪✪ moves go up one level of proration and ✪✪✪✪✪ go up two, but even if they successfully land you cannot chain them into another hit."
talent,Axel,Bog-Standard Palette,,0,"Axel is immune to effects revolving around things “so awful they have actual effects” due to his awful tastes in everything. For example, attacks that use “bad music” to deal damage don’t affect him because he weirdly likes them. Same with food, movies, and pretty much anything you can think of. Can selectively not work based on RP reasons."
talent,Axel,Perfect Contact,,0,"Axel can telepathically communicate with anyone he knows, regardless of distance or plane. This communication is two-way, but must be initiated by Axel."
talent,Axel,Perfect Direction,,0,"Axel always knows the direction of true and magnetic north and if those things are fucky at the moment, and can naturally navigate to locations he’s been to before unless something is interrupting his ability to track."
talent,Axel,Wanderlust Form,,0,"By spending ✪✪✪✪✪ as a free action, Axel can enter a special form for the next two rounds where his hair turns blue and his energy becomes much much stronger, mixing the red white and blue colors into a purple. His rolls get the d12 advantage his passive can grant, he gets a passive +1 damage to all his attacks, and his ✪✪✪ and ✪✪✪✪✪ supers now ignore combo proration entirely."
talent,Axel,Ace In The Hole,,1,"Once Axel is at or below 1/4th of his max stamina rounded down, he no longer has to pay stamina for abilities until he goes back above that, and he immediately gains ✪✪✪ the first time this happens in a combat."
talent,Axel,Perfect Transport,,1,"As a movement action, Axel is able to teleport to a space adjacent to anyone he knows, regardless of distance or plane. However, this ability is also fairly easy to inhibit and tends to get muddled by planar whims or stress, occasionally disabling travel outside of the immediate vicinity. Axel cannot take anything other than what he normally carries with him."
passive,Axel,Spangled Stars,,1,"Whenever Axel lands a successful damaging hit on someone, he gets a ✪ star! He can only have a max of 5 ✪s at a time. He can spend one ✪ as a once per round anytime to give someone a sort of advantage, where they roll a 1d12 that is still judged on the d20 scale (that does not crit on 12) as their second advantage roll. He can also spend ✪s when using abilities to boost their power! [16 Prof] Fight Anticipation - Axel gets +✪ at the start of combat. [45 Prof] Star Point Anchor - Axel now keeps his ✪s between combats. [50 Prof] Granting 1d12 advantage no longer requires a roll to grant. Spending the ✪ makes it automatically trigger."
passive,Axel,Share The Love,,0,"Axel’s epithet gathers energy from people’s love. Via this technique a funny doctor (:O) helped him develop, Axel can send some of that energy back! As an unrolled main action that can’t combo, Axel can divvy up any of the ✪s he has to allies within 3 spaces, who can use them with actions to boost their level! Usually ✪ boosts a skill to an “EX” version, dealing slightly more damage and gaining some nice extra effect. ✪✪✪ and ✪✪✪✪✪ are escalating levels of super powered modifications with ✪✪✪✪✪ being basically Once Per Combat level."
ability,Axel,London Knuckle,1,0,"Axel does a dash forwards as energy comes off his fist. This deals 5 (7) damage as he dashes up to 6 spaces away. This can hit multiple targets, but the damage is reduced greatly after the first. The hit can either be an energy slice in which Axel passes through his targets, or it can be a punch that sends the targets flying back. Axel can combo even if the knockback hit is chosen by attacking them before they’d be launched back. ✪ - +3 damage. This rolls with the 1d12 advantage your passive grants. ✪✪✪ - This causes you to use London Knuckle up to three times. You have to roll for each usage but only pay stamina for one. Each hit prorates in your combo separately. This also only generates one ✪ even if multiple of the London Knuckles hit. ✪✪✪✪✪ - +5 damage. +6 range. +1 crit range. This hit only works on a single target as Axel punches a star-shaped weak point on the target, causing them to fly up to 10 spaces back. [14 Prof] Your basic attack and London Knuckle get +1 damage. [41 Prof] Your basic attack and London Knuckle get +1 damage."
ability,Axel,Venice Spire,3,1,"Axel channels energy into his fists before punching the ground. On any space within 5 range of Axel, a giant spike of energy comes up from the floor and skewers a target for 5 (7) damage and knocking them in the air! On higher rolls this can cause a bleed proc. ✪ - +2 damage. The spike gets a secondary effect of your choice! ✪✪✪ - +2 damage. Instead of one targeted spike, Axel causes a line of three spikes to shoot out from in front of him. Axel can choose to have there be between 0 and 2 spaces between each spike along the line, and the line can be diagonal. The spikes get a secondary effect of your choice! ✪✪✪✪✪ - +2 damage. Instead of one targeted spike, Axel creates three rings of spikes around him to shoot out on all sides of him. Axel can choose to have there be between 0 and 2 spaces between each ring of spikes. The spikes either get a secondary effect of your choice, or you can trade out the effect and the bleed for knockback which can chain from one spike to the next! [32 Prof] Choose one: Venice Spire gets +2 damage."
ability,Axel,Tokyo Flare,1,0,"Axel charges star-shaped energy into his palm before tossing it to the floor. It travels along the ground like a shockwave, dealing 4 (5) damage to a target within 8 range. ✪ - +1 damage. The projectile gets a special property of your choice! ✪✪✪ - +1 damage. The projectile knocks the enemy into the air, stunning them long enough for Axel to immediately take a move action and continue the combo. ✪✪✪✪✪ - +2 damage. The projectile explodes on the target it hits, dealing an additional 3 damage to both the hit target and everyone adjacent to the blast. [23 Prof] Choose one: Tokyo Flare gets either +2 range or +1 damage."
ability,Axel,California Eagle,2,0,"Axel proceeds to kick in the air multiple times! This move causes Axel to move forwards in the air 3 spaces, dealing 2 damage and knocking back the target in front of him for each movement he takes, with the final hit slamming them into the floor. This attack rolls with d12 advantage if the target being attacked is in the air. ✪ - Moves 4 spaces instead of 3. Grants d12 advantage on your next action this turn if the target is in the air. ✪✪✪ - Moves 5 spaces instead of 3. The final hit kicks the target up to 5 spaces away in a direction of your choice. ✪✪✪✪✪ - Moves 7 spaces instead of 3. The final hit slams the target into the ground so hard that their next movement action is halved"
ability,Axel,Paris Parry,0,0,"Axel moves his body to deflect a melee attack slightly to reduce its damage, and proceeds to go in with an energy-infused jab for half his basic attack damage back. He’ll step a few spaces forwards to get in range if necessary. This cannot combo. Once per round. ✪ - Axel moves his body to block a melee attack regardless of the weight or force, negating the incoming damage. ✪✪✪ - Axel moves his body to block a melee attack regardless of the weight or force, negating the incoming damage. His counterattack does his full basic attack damage. ✪✪✪✪✪ - Axel moves his body to block a melee attack regardless of the weight or force, negating the incoming damage. His counterattack does his full basic attack damage. You can combo off this hit."
ability,Axel,Giza Drop,3!,0,"Axel jumps at extreme speeds to a target within his movement speed of range that is currently airborne, grabbing them before bursting straight up into the air. He then does a spinning drop attack from high in the air to slam them down on that space to deal 5 damage. This move does not combo and prorates if done during a combo, but does not take up a combo’s action since it’s an anytime. Once per round. ✪ - +1 damage. Once they’ve launched into the air, Axel can have the target and him land on any space within his movement speed of range. ✪✪✪ - +2 damage. This version can also combo but only if it is Axel’s turn. ✪✪✪✪✪ - +2 damage. You can combo off this hit."
weapon,Echo,Enkidu,,1,"One dagger in a set of two, this dark grey blade patterned like sakura wood is of the highest craftsmanship. It deals 8 damage at 1 range which pierces mundane DR, can be used in the middle of movement, and can be used as a main or movement action. You may only attack with this weapon once per round. Each time you attack with this weapon and don’t critically succeed, its crit range increases by +1 until it next crits. You may also use this weapon not to attack, but to instead use the Taunt weapon action, which increases your critical hit range by +1 for all attacks until you next crit this combat (taunts automatically succeed). As a passive while holding both Enkidu and Gilgamesh, if you have at least four allies, all your allies are unconscious, and you are at 10 or less stamina, then any of your actions that succeed are considered critical successes. This state does not end if you heal above the stamina threshold, but does end if any of your allies are resuscitated. Even if you’re an epithet user, you gain proficiency from using Enkidu as if you were a mundie. As a guaranteed success bonus action, Echo can transport the pattern of an ally’s epithet into Enkidu. Only one epithet can be held like this at a time, and it can be held between sessions. You can transform into that person as if they were currently in your party. At the start of a session, you may roll three random words and choose one. That becomes Enkidu’s current Attunement. As an X cost ability, you can generally utilize your Attunement to create effects related to it. If your Attunement is the same epithet as the epithet of someone you’ve transformed into before, then you can transform into them as if they were present in the party. If your Attunement is the same epithet as the epithet of the person you’re attacking, Enkidu deals 1.5x damage rounding up to them and has resistance to that epithet’s attempt to weaken or stop Enkidu or its attacks. Enkidu has five Glass Fragments, which act as special charges. She can expend these charges passively and without a roll to increase a single instance of a numeric epithetical effect by +1. This can be done to an action, even after the action is rolled. When altering things, the effect will last at most a round before returning to its original state. You can do this to anything that originates from you or something adjacent to you. These Glass Fragments recharge at the end of the session."
weapon,Echo,Gilgamesh,,1,"One dagger in a set of two, this dark red blade patterned with spider webbing is of the highest craftsmanship. It deals 8 damage at 1 range which pierces mundane DR, can be used in the middle of movement, and can be used as a main or movement action. You may only attack with this weapon once per round. Each time you attack with this weapon and don’t critically succeed, its crit range increases by +1 until it next crits. You may also use this weapon not to attack, but to instead use the Taunt weapon action, which increases your critical hit range by +1 for all attacks until you next crit this combat (taunts automatically succeed). As a passive while holding both Enkidu and Gilgamesh, if you have at least four allies, all your allies are unconscious, and you are at 10 or less stamina, then any of your actions that succeed are considered critical successes. This state does not end if you heal above the stamina threshold, but does end if any of your allies are resuscitated. The wielder of Gilgamesh has access to a special 1 cost ability that acts as a sword wave slash, which deals 3 damage up to 8 range away and pierces through enemies to potentially deal damage to multiple people. Gilgamesh comes with a set of programmable modes. Whenever someone wields Gilgamesh, the blade automatically records the person’s various aspects to work best for them, granting them extra features and modifying the weapon to be their best fit. These modes are called Profiles, and you may swap which one is active any time once per round. Uniquely, because of how Echo’s powers work the blade also records Profiles for whoever she is turned into as well. (This applies retroactively to her previous transformations as well, since on her own time she can turn into them.) (Link to doc with all Profiles) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsbON2S7zmYA47Ae0ir3OPyT_nc-UOXhSdsfyBl77GM/edit"
talent,Echo,Lightweight Variant,,0,"Echo gets +1 movement regardless of who she’s taking the form of. [74 Prof] Echo gets +1 movement regardless of who she’s taking the form of. In addition, whenever she moves she can dissipate into shadow and appear in the appropriate location, effectively acting as a teleport (though this can’t move her through solid walls)."
talent,Echo,Best Friend Bash,,0,"Whenever you perform an action, you may create a shadow copy that moves up to half your movement speed rounded up and then performs that action, instead of you doing it yourself. This doesn’t require any extra rolls and keeps the real Echo away from most forms of retaliation. Whenever a Best Friend Bash is released, at the end of their action if they were successfully performed you can choose to teleport to the position they were at. [42 Prof] Whenever a Terror Twin is released, at the end of their action if they were successfully performed you can choose to teleport to the position they were at. [56 Prof] Best Friend Bash no longer costs extra stamina to use."
talent,Echo,Rise of The Reskins,,0,"Rise of The Reskins - When in the presence of Echo, other Copycat characters get stronger! Any copying or copied things in their kit(s) cost 1 less stamina to use (to a minimum of 1) and roll with a +1 modifier."
talent,Echo,Getting The Download,,0,"Once a move has been successfully performed against Echo, she slightly learns how to counter it. This lets her spend 1 stamina and perform a counter roll against that move whenever it’s used on her again this combat."
passive,Echo,Dark Copy,,0,Echo can add some kind of shadow element to anything she does.
passive,Echo,Double Trouble,,1,Echo now has two move actions on her turns.
passive,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Blizzard Body,,1,"You are able to completely turn into snow. This grants you immunity to cold damage to a certain temperature extent. In addition, your snow naturally parts when threatened with extreme damage. This means you have an effective 5 DR that only triggers when taking more than 10 damage, in such a way that if you say took 12 damage, 2 of your DR would activate and you would take 10 instead"
passive,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Snow Grace,,0,"With the ability to dissolve into snow, you can move through non-complete barriers such as enemies and objects, as well as travel through the air (though you cannot stay flying once you rematerialize). In addition, you can freely dissolve and move through snow, and in snow storms you appear invisible unless 2 spaces away."
ability,Echo,Terror Twin,1!,2,"Echo creates a shadowy duplicate of their current form at their current location, performing a specified action or anytime. This target is ethereal and cannot normally be interacted with. As a move action, Echo can “release” the copy to have them fly out anywhere within their movement speed and perform the specified action. Whether or not the action succeeds or fails, the copy disappears afterwards. Each Terror Twin has a 1 stamina upkeep. Once per round. [18 Prof] Terrible Twos - As long as you only have one Terror Twin out at a time, you no longer have to pay its upkeep cost. [22 Prof] Who’s The Real One? - As a move action Echo can switch teleport with a Terror Twin. [42 Prof] Whenever a Terror Twin is released, at the end of their action if they were successfully performed you can choose to teleport to the position they were at. [44 Prof] Terror Twins no longer have an upkeep cost associated with them. [46 Prof] Fast Fakers - Terror Twins can now be used with anytimes, allowing them to be stored for later. They still require a movement action to be activated."
ability,Echo,Fake Around Here,1!,1,"An attack that would hit Echo instead passes straight through a shadow. Echo can then choose to spend an additional stamina to take a movement action and get out of dodge! Once per round. [54 Prof] After successfully using Fake Around Here, you can choose to pay an additional stamina and roll to immediately create a Terror Twin in the spot that was attacked."
ability,Echo,Five Man Band,3⛯,2,"Once per combat Echo can make their form suddenly unstable, allowing them to perform one action as each of their party members individually by creating multiple shadowy clones. Echo still has to pay stamina for any of these actions if applicable on top of this ability’s cost, and has to roll for each of them on top of rolling for this. [12 Prof] If there are less than five other party members in your team, Echo’s Five Man Band can use multiple actions from the party members you *do* have to total to five. [28 Prof] We’re Gonna Get You~ - When using Five Man Band, you can hold each of their actions as Terror Twins. However, they are released as free actions instead of move actions. You still roll for each."
ability,Echo,Seeing Double,X!,1,"A shadowy copy of something, whether it be an item, action, event, person, or even a place, forks out from the original. If a duplicated thing stays out in the field, then this ability can’t be used again until that thing is dispelled as a free action. If Echo is knocked out, they’re automatically dispelled. Cost is dependent on the power and complexity of what is being replicated. Once per round."
ability,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Igloo Defense,X,0,"By extending your hands, you can create up to X spaces of snow. Each space has around 10 effective stamina of its own and has your cold damage immunity, but is vulnerable to heat damage. You can freely pass through these yourself."
ability,Yuki Yuki No Mi,Snow Warning,1,0,"The area begins to snow supernaturally, even while inside. This decreases the temperature of the area to below freezing and covers the arena in a thin layer of snow. Any fire damage made within the snowstorm is halved rounding up, while cold damage is increased by 1.5x, rounding down. Upkeep 1."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Yugure,,0,"Elanora’s oldest weapon, a katana that has seen every battlefield. Deals 5 damage at 1 range."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Earthshaker,,0,"A large, rusted metal sword. This deals 7 damage at 2 range."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Parrying Dagger,,0,"A small knife, effective for dueling and easy to acquire. Deals 3 damage at 1 range. Can be used as a partial main action at full effectiveness."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Stonework,,0,"An even larger version of the Earthshaker, made of stone. This deals 9 damage at 3 range."
weapon,Dusk Elanora,Cognizant Scythe,,0,A scythe made of psychic energy. Deals 5 damage at 2 range.
talent,Dusk Elanora,Weapon Stance,,1,"Elanora is able to immediately hold a weapon and understand its unique stylings, and take that for herself. She can instantly use any weapon properly and can wield two-handed weapons with one hand. She can have exactly one weapon “drawn” at a time. Only drawn weapons can be used, and it takes a bonus action to switch drawn weapons. You can draw a weapon for free at the start of combat. While a weapon is drawn, it effectively acts as a stance, giving you extra passive benefits and granting/modifying abilities. Natural 20s with weapons grant you proficiency as if using your epithet. Finally, once per session you may permanently keep a weapon you find/steal for yourself, writing a new stance for it."
passive,Dusk Elanora,Thief of Destiny,,1,"Elanora’s epithet drains her of her own colors. As such, she has almost no action economy of her own: she cannot take main, move, bonus, or anytime actions normally. However, she can subvert this by stealing the action economy of others. She can freely take actions from allies that are willing to give it to her, but when it comes to the unwilling she needs to actually take from them. Whenever you land an attack on an enemy, you can steal your choice of a Partial Main Action, Partial Move Action, a bonus action, or an anytime usage from them. Partial Main Actions are functionally half of a main action: Elanora may freely combine two partial main actions into one, or split main actions into two partials. A partial main action can be used to do anything that a normal main action can do, but at halved effectiveness rounding up. When you steal a Partial Main Action from someone, it takes half the next main action turning it into a Partial Main action. A Partial Move Action is effectively the same thing: it’s a move action where you travel half your movement (rounding up), and you can freely merge/split them yourself. When stealing any kind of action, it effectively removes that person’s action of that type from being usable the next time they’d be able to. If a person does not have a type of action normally, you can only take a max of one of those actions from them in a combat, and you can’t have allies lend you actions they do not have either. Lastly: while you still gain the partial main actions, you cannot steal the last Partial Main Action someone has their next turn. Elanora can keep actions she steals for as long as she desires in a combat, although she can’t bring it between combats. The only action economy of her own is a single partial movement action, which cannot be stored like the actions she steals."
ability,Dusk Elanora,Thief of Notions,3,0,Elanora grabs an enemy and takes as much of their destiny as she can. This ability effectively acts as four steal triggers from your passive (Thief of Destiny) at once. Its speed means that enemies roll disadvantage on anytimes trying to stop this.
ability,Dusk Elanora,Color Chain,2!,2,"An epithetical chain of colors manifests from Elanora’s missing arm, acting as a 6 range tether. Not once per round."
ability,Dusk Elanora,Hurricane Spin,2,0,"Elanora spins around attacking all around her. This deals 2 damage to all adjacent enemy spaces to her. She then takes a step forward and spins again, and does this for a total of 2 spaces moved and 3 attacks."
weapon,Ramos,Punch/Kick,,0,"Ramos hits a man just kinda generally, dealing 7 damage at 1 range. Can potentially trade damage for other stuff I guess. [45 Prof] Skill And Power Combined - Ramos gains +1 basic attack damage and can move-act-move. "
talent,Ramos,I'm Kinda Born Perfect,,2,"Ramos has the benefits of being a powerhouse and expert mundie at the same time, and is of the “excel” build type."
talent,Ramos,Don't Sweat The Details,,0,"You’re just absolutely horrible with money. Any cash that ends up in your hands is spent, stolen, or lost within half an hour."
talent,Ramos,Eyes of The Sage,,0,Ramos’ epithet augments his sight such that he naturally notices finer details about techniques that others might not. This also gives him a +5 on perception checks.
passive,Ramos,God-Given Talent,,2,"Ramos is so naturally talented as to instantly create incredible techniques with just the slightest bit of thought and experimentation. He has access to a special resource known as Talent, and can spend it at any time to develop new techniques. Your Talent is equal to your Proficiency. When creating a new technique, Ramos must roll for each feature of the technique being made. However, he can replace his roll with the highest roll he’s performed himself either creating or using that Inspiration for the technique in this combat. Ramos’ big limiting factor is that he can’t really “think outside the box”, so he needs to see something before he starts thinking about how he can utilize it himself. This gives him Inspiration for that technique which lasts forever (so long as he remembers it). He can’t gain Inspiration for something unless he can think of some method (even if it’s some very bullshit anime logic) of doing it himself. New techniques last for as long as you have Talent “allocated” to it, and can un-allocate at the start of your turns. So long as one roll to create the technique was a 20, or Ramos rolls a 20 using/in relation to that technique, it becomes put on his sheet. He still needs to put the same amount of Talent into it to unlock it, however: whenever Ramos gains Proficiency, he can instead permanently lower the Talent cost of that technique by 1.5x rounding up. Techniques that use abilities beyond what a normal person should be capable of will have a minimum Talent cost that can’t be reduced equal to the number of impossible elements. Lastly, you can allocate Talent for these universal features. You don’t need to roll when you do these: 1 Talent -> +1 movement. 2 Talent -> +1 in a non-combat general skill (ex. Strength, stealth, lockpicking) 5 Talent -> -1 stamina costs paid (minimum cost of 0) 10 Talent -> +1 per round 1 cost dodgeroll anytime. 10 Talent -> Natural +1 on all rolls (max of +3) 50 Talent -> An additional action [43 Prof] Mastered Technique - Once Ramos has reduced a technique’s talent requirement to its minimum, he can now use that technique in place of ALL of its inspirations when developing new skills. [53 Prof] Focused Insight - Whenever Ramos critically succeeds on a technique he’s created, and he can still spend Proficiency on that technique to lower its permanent Talent cost, he can spend the Proficiency gained from that crit into the Talent at a 1:3.5 ratio instead of 1:1.5."
passive,Ramos,"Excellence Is Not An Art, It's A Habit",,2,"Ramos has a special resource known as “Excel”. He can have up to 5 at a time. Ramos starts combat with max stacks of Excel (because his default state is awesome). He gains one at the start of his turns passively, and can spend 10 Talent to regenerate one instantly. Excel can be spent when performing actions to dramatically alter them for the better. This can be done after a roll, even to get around anytimes. It always succeeds but may require a roll to determine effectiveness. Lastly: Ramos can also spend Excel to redo a roll for making a technique."
passive,Ramos,Psychic Body Stance: Remote Siege,,1,"By paying additional stamina before performing any martial arts techniques, Ramos can cause the attack (with +1 damage) to originate from psychic limbs appearing around the target before disappearing. This increases their range by 3 per stamina cost paid and lets him attack a target so long as he can sense their location. The limbs appear around the target and are invisible unless you’re a psychic yourself, meaning these actions gain slightly weaker benefits of invisibility (can’t react outside of highly instinct based features, invisible roll bonus)."
passive,Ramos,Unholy Constitution,,2,"Ramos can fill his body with unholy demonic energies granting him a form of sacrilegious immortality. This grants Ramos Fast Healing 6, and two of this fast healing can be active while unconscious unless Ramos is in contact with something of holy energy (silver, holy water, etc). Ramos cannot receive healing outside of this passive while it is active."
ability,Ramos,The Impasse of My Perfection,?2,1,"This action can be “held” in secret, either using your main or movement action. Upon an attack being used against you, so long as you have the proper inspiration for that technique, you can immediately spend this held attack to zoom up to your movement speed to them, dodging the incoming hit and perform that exact attack against them. If held as a main action, the attack’s effectiveness is increased by 1.5x rounding up. Cost is equal to the replicated technique + 2."
ability,Ramos,One-Inch Punch,3,1,"Despite only moving your fist slightly, Ramos delivers a massive amount of force in one attack. This deals 10 damage piercing through Physical DR and 10 knockback at 1 range. If a target hits a wall, any extra knockback is converted into damage. They also deal 5 damage to any enemies whom they fly through while being hit back. Recharge 6."
ability,Ramos,High Fly Razor,3,0,"Ramos jumps towards a target within his movement speed as range, grabs them, twists them in the air, and piledrives them into the ground. This can work on targets regardless of size, deals 6 damage +1 per size category above 1x1 of the target, and knocks them to the ground prone."
ability,Ramos,It's Within My Capabilities,5!,0,"Ramos instantly moves up to an action to get a close up detailed observation of it. This should give him actions, but instead he is able to gain a stored roll equal to the roll of the action observed with a natural +1. He can only use this stored die on himself and only on either using a technique that would share an inspiration with the observed technique, or when developing that technique himself. These stored dice last basically forever until you use them. Once per round."
ability,Ramos,Epiphany,0,0,Free action. Once per session. A visible aura of power starts emanating from the epithet user. For the next 3 rounds this character reduces the cost of their abilities by 1 stamina (to a minimum of 1). Stamina upkeep for abilities is also reduced and may be reduced to 0.
ability,Ramos,Wind Step Palm,1,0,"Ramos uses his basic attack, but using a flowing stance. This allows him to move up to 3 spaces before the attack occurs, and the attack gains additional knockback equal to its damage. The knockback can send them in any direction, not just straight back. If they’re knocked into a wall, any excess knockback is converted into damage."
ability,Ramos,Psychic Blast Technique: Emerald Eye,3,1,"Ramos uses his psychic energy to create a 1x1 orb of psychic energy next to him. This “eye” can be moved by Ramos up to 6 spaces on his turn or as a 1 cost twice per round anytime. It deals 6 contact damage to enemies once per turn per person and pushes/knocks around enemies. Ramos can see through the eye and gets a +1 on perception checks while it’s out. This technique is easily modifiable with external psychic energy: Ramos can take a bonus action to attempt to modify the psychic energy of the orb using one of his inspirations by altering his psychic energy for the round. If he crits on this, or the orb crits while it has it, Ramos can create a new version of this technique that incorporates that new aspect as if critting on a new technique. Lastly, Ramos can as an anytime detonate the orb, exploding to deal 11 damage to all enemies adjacent to them and inflicting Knock Up. Each ability instance of this can only have one eye active at a time. Once per combat."
ability,Ramos,Sword Smithing Technique: Blade Of Infinite Recursion,1,0,"Ramos takes a nearby piece of material and instantaneously creates a supreme quality weapon out of it, infused with your psychic power. This creates a 1-3 range 7-13 damage blade out of the material, with stats dependent on the roll to make it and the materials it's made out of. The blade can cleave or pierce to hit multiple targets at once. It also has the special property of recycling kinetic energy. Whenever the blade lands an attack or is used to block an attack, it stores a charge of power. You may release this power before making a roll to increase the roll, damage, or knockback of the attack. These swords can continue to exist without Ramos’ intervention, but lose their psychic property when separated from him."
ability,Ramos,Demon Aura Technique: God Sight,5,0,"Ramos unleashes a massive amount of ki, imbued with a dark and sinister power. This creates a 10 range aura of intense spiritual pressure that instantly applies a fear affect for the round on anyone within while inside, and applies a continuous fear effect if they can sense spiritual pressure. Ramos’ aura allows him to be completely aware of whatever happens in the area, letting him observe things that are invisible and react almost instantaneously. This also means that effects that make anytimes harder via speed or stealth are entirely ineffective on him. Lastly, it also causes “It’s Within My Capabilities” to roll with advantage. Upkeep 1. Bonus action. Once per combat. (fear is double movement cost to move towards you and disadvantage to attack you)"
weapon,Regent Grey,All I Want Is Endless,,2,"White and black flames manifest in any configuration you can imagine, obliterating a target for 12 damage at 10 range. This damage is typeless."
passive,Regent Grey,Bow Thy Head And Close Thy Peasant Mind,,2,"Regent Grey has advantage on all of their rolls, which can stack with other forms of advantage. In addition, whenever an attack would be made against them or they’d be targeted with an effect, Regent Grey can perform an action to try and counter it. Should they roll higher than the incoming effect and their action is appropriate for it, they counter what would affect them completely!"
ability,Regent Grey,B Tatsu,5,2,"Despite her apparition-like appearance and frail form, this bitch can throw down like you wouldn’t believe. Regent Grey kicks or punches a target for 9 damage. The first time this succeeds, you may immediately follow up with another hit that requires its own roll. You can keep doing this for a total of 3 attacks."
ability,Regent Grey,Dishonest Confession,7,2,"A massive scythe appears from behind Regent Grey, which they twirl and control as if it were an extension of themself. She can throw it up to 8 spaces, as it slashes everything it passes through for 11 damage. The scythe will stay in the location you threw it to, continuing to float there and dealing 1 damage at the start of every turn to anyone within and whenever someone enters its area. You can move the scythe through the air up to three spaces for free. Scythes occupy a 3 range radius (7 range diameter) circular area. These scythes can never deal damage to yourself, but can hurt allies."
ability,Regent Grey,Derelict Passion,5,2,"Time washes and bleeds over something, causing it to rapidly wither, rot, and become destitute. This can cause items and places to become weak and aged, covered in dust and cobwebs. You have extreme control over how this happens, letting you fuck with even conceptual features of things."
ability,Regent Grey,"Anything You Want, Or Nothing At All",25,2,"Regent Grey uses her strange axiom of existence to mess with the nature of something, causing it to either become true or false. This can bring things into and out of reality, turn effects on and off, and much more."
ability,Regent Grey,Faded Page,?,2,"At any point in the session, you may replace Faded Page with any other ability for the rest of the combat."
ability,Regent Grey,So You Had A Dream About This Place,X,2,"Reality flickers and tears, blurs and blooms like an old black-and-white polaroid being stretched across the memories of time. Regent Grey overlays a new, schrodinger’s reality onto the currently existing one, letting her replace up to X times 9 spaces with the window into a nostalgic place. This replaces whatever it was placed over. You can set the rules of the world to operate differently within this blistered space."
ability,Regent Grey,Monochrome Memory,5,2,"Regent Grey swings her scythe with blinding speed, demolishing a 5x7 area in front of her for 11 damage. This deals double damage to structures and removes terrain effects and ambient powers from the area."
weapon,Sora,Scythe Appendage,,0,"Sora can shapeshift from her palms into a scythe-like bone protrusion, cutting at enemies for 2 damage at 1 range. This weapon also passively lets her climb up almost any surface!"
weapon,Sora,Ally Toss,,0,"As an action, Sora can pick up an ally of the same or less size category as her and throw them up to 6 spaces away! This requires no roll unless she is trying to use the ally as a damaging projectile."
talent,Sora,Sliver Sense,,0,"Even more so than most animals, Slivers have an animalistic intuition that keeps them out of danger, acting as almost a sixth sense. Slivers cannot be surprised, and can get a general “danger sense” on certain people, areas, objects, situations, etc."
passive,Sora,Sliver Queen,,2,"Sora’s epithet allows her to foster the growth of Slivers, strange shapeshifting creatures found across the multiverse. These little fuckers not only reproduce incredibly fast to the point of frequently mutating, but can then shapeshift themselves to have every mutation of each sliver nearby. Sora can command them telepathically as they are connected to her hive. At the start of combat Sora can incubate five sliver hatchlings, rolled for on the sliver table. She gains a new hatchling at the start of her turns (can only hold a max of 5 at a time). During her turn she can “hatch” slivers she has incubated, but only if she has enough Shards to pay for its play cost. Shards are a special resource, representing Sora’s psychic connection to these otherworldly creatures. Sora starts each combat with 3 Shards, and gains 1 whenever a sliver deals damage to an enemy that’s being flanked (one per target per round). Her maximum at any one point is 5. All slivers have at base 2 stamina, a 2 damage basic attack, 5 movement, and can climb most surfaces. In addition, at the end of combat she may mutate a new sliver to be added to the sliver list either now or after the session. She can also mutate new slivers by sacrificing any number of stat increases in return for that many new slivers! There are more rules to creating new slivers on the sliver table. If Sora is unconscious however, all slivers panic before going dormant, waiting for their queen to return."
passive,Sora,Sora Sliver,,0,Sora counts as a sliver.
ability,Sora,Mind Shard,3,0,"A psychic shard of energy pierces an area within 3 range. This shard emits a small 1-3 range aura. Any enemy that leaves the area is hit with psychic damage equal to the number of turns that have passed since it was created (minimum of 5, maximum of 25), dispersing the area in the process. Each shard has an upkeep of 1, but you can have multiple on the field. As a move action, a sliver may switch teleport with a psychic shard. This does not cause it to detonate if it causes an enemy to leave its area."
ability,Sora,Enter The Hivemind,3⛯,0,"A wave of psychic energy covers the field as Sora’s mental domain expands into the physical world. This creates a 3 range aura around herself in which she has perfect senses. When first activated and at the start of their turns, Sora can create “Psychic Slivers” for free. These ethereal slivers cannot leave Sora’s aura and don’t have their own effects, but inherit effects from other slivers like normal. Sora can have up to 2 out at a time. In addition, allies within the area are considered Slivers while inside. Upkeep 3. Once per combat."
ability,Sora,Psycho Shock,3,0,"Sora unleashes a massive burst of mental energy, creating a 2 range explosion of psychic lightning around yourself. This deals 5 lightning damage to all enemies in the area, pushes them out of the area, and temporarily staggers them, making them unable to react in any way until the end of the turn."
weapon,Gervasio,Omnidextrous Assault,,0,"A strike with a highly adaptable limb. This move has a base 6 damage 1 range, however Gervasio can trade out damage for range (cannot be set to have less than 1 damage). Gervasio also gets to choose his hand’s shape and properties, letting him choose what damage type it deals. [18 Prof] +1 Omnidextrous Assault damage"
weapon,Gervasio,Arch Enemy,,0,"Gervasio’s hair itself is highly adaptable and can be controlled with extreme precision. This weapon acts as a copy of any basic weapon used successfully within the last round, except it gains a +1 to damage and range. Once attempted, it cannot be used on the same weapon until it is again seen used successfully."
talent,Gervasio,Natural Selection,,0,"At any point, you may name a damage type. Gervasio's skin adapts, granting you resistance to that damage type for the rest of combat. Once per combat."
talent,Gervasio,Peak Performance,,0,"Gervasio has advantage on all saving throws. (for the sake of this talent, all d20 rolls forced upon you by a negative force in which higher results are preferable are considered saving throws)"
talent,Gervasio,Maxed Stimuli,,0,"Gervasio’s senses are extremely heightened compared to that of a normal human. He has advantage on all sensory checks, and can perform superhuman feats of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste."
passive,Gervasio,Survival of The Fittest,,1,"Upon seeing a feature successfully used, Gervasio may attempt a free roll to slot that feature into an Adaptation Slot. This causes his physiology to be altered in a strange way, granting Gervasio an additional ability or passive that is specially designed to help him counter said feature and/or the person it came from. He can also perform actions / add onto any of his actions additional properties of any one person who he has an Adaptation Slot from. Adapting this way happens after the usage’s effects take place. Gervasio has three Adaptation Slots, and can carry them between combats."
ability,Gervasio,Cross Breed,XY,1,"With this ability, Gervasio morphs his body to replicate and synthesize effects he’s recently witnessed to create a superior ability. This lets him choose two abilities between any that he’s seen used successfully within the last round and ones in an Adaptation Slot, and combine them (either statistically or rhetorically) into one move. Cost is equal to the total cost of both abilities synthesized."
ability,Gervasio,Strength in Numbers,X,0,"Gervasio performs a massive barrage attack, using more of his body and in more ways depending on how much stamina he spends on this. For each stamina spent, choose one: - Perform a basic attack. Hitting a target that you already are hitting with this move halves the damage rounded up, and this will continue to stack. - Add an effect to all the attacks from this move, via altering the shape or properties of your body or just how Gervasio is performing his attacks."
ability,Gervasio,Rapid Hybridize,X!,1,"From his body Gervasio immediately creates a highly elastic limb, This acts as a 5 range tether, after which it disintegrates. You may pay additional stamina to choose the following options. Each option can only be chosen once: Splice - A hand forms at the end of the elastic limb. If it grapples onto a target, then Gervasio may perform a genetic transfer where stats and buffs are exchanged between him and the target. Gervasio chooses the trades. The number and voracity of these changes are dependent on the roll. Detach - The limb detaches from Gervasio, doubling its range. However, instead of being attached to Gervasio, it attaches to another target within 5 spaces of the initial hit one, with that person acting as the caster for these effects. Serrate - Limb deals 3 damage of a damage type of your choice to the target it latches onto."
ability,Gervasio,Theory of Evolution,XXX,0,"Gervasio may choose X number of targets between himself, an item, or a target within 3 range. His epithet then rapidly simulates a specific scenario or environment of his choice thousands of times over, as the targets begin to adapt and evolve at an extreme rate in whichever way makes them best able to survive and thrive in that situation. These alterations take up an adaptation slot."
weapon,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Psychometric Slap,,0,"You’re a thief, not a coward. Slap or sucker punch someone with your ungloved hand, dealing 4 damage at 1 range. When you do this, you can gain a single piece of info from their mind, or from its inner contents if it’s an object like a book or CD."
weapon,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse","For My Neutral Special, I Wield A Gun",,0,A flintlock pistol. It’s not even silenced. Deals 4 damage at 3 range because you’re a bad shot.
passive,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Looks Like I Gotta Jet!,,0,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse, can utilize his epithet to make a perfect escape across the planes! During his movement action, if Jet is out of anyone’s line of sight (ignoring unimportant shit like grass and bugs, and God) he can spend 1 movement to then appear in any other location across the multiverse that also has no line of sight on. He can do this either to move around an arena in odd ways, or to travel to other locations to quickly steal useful items!"
passive,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Plunder Aplenty,,0,"Jet Sterling is able to store various stolen items within the apparatus on his back! With this passive, he can now store items between sessions so long as he can carry them with two hands. He can also store things stolen with his abilities."
ability,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Property Poach,3,1,"Jet Sterling extends his hands forwards and robs an object within 6 range of one of its traits or aspects. This removes that aspect from the object while storing it for later use. As a bonus action Jet can either apply the aspect to himself or adjacent things, or create objects out of the “essence” of that trait. If Jet Sterling steals something with Property Poach and applies/creates with it immediately, he can use the same roll as what he used to steal as if doing the whole thing in one action."
ability,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Yoink!,1!,0,"Jet Sterling uses his epithet to steal an object straight out of thin air, so long as it’s within his line of sight and Jet could hold it in one hand. Once per round."
ability,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse","I'm Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief in The Multiverse!",1,0,"Boast about one of your totally real escapades you once did that shows how great you are. While doing so the universe will be too distracted or annoyed, making it so that you can immediately take a move action and pull out something related to the story you’re explaining and then use/apply it. Alternatively, you can instead perform a series of simple actions or a non-ability action, during which everyone will be too distracted to perform any kind of anytimes or reactionary effects until it’s too late. Notably, while this is active everyone within earshot will be focusing on you."
ability,"Jet Sterling, Greatest Thief In The Multiverse",Thief of Five Fates,2!,1,"Oh, I’m sorry, was that your roll? With this ability Jet steals away the d20 roll of another target, storing it for himself while the other person has to reroll. Does not work on 20s or 1s. Jet can only store one roll at a time, cannot steal his own rolls, and can only use stored rolls on himself. It requires a roll to apply a stored roll. Once per round."
weapon,Reeves,Flashy Kicks,,0,Stylish martial arts that pack a serious wallop. These legs are to be feared. 5 damage as a melee weapon. This weapon suffers no loss in damage when used focused on other non-damaging effects.
talent,Reeves,"Personally, I Prefer The Air",,0,"The sky is Reeves’ domain to control, where no one can contest her style and tenacity. For every ten feet off the ground Reeves is, she deals +1 damage on all of her attacks. This bonus is not increased by To Infinity and Beyond. For every round she remains off the ground, the bonus doubles (additively). This isn’t to say she can’t mix things up; on the contrary, she’s quite good at keeping her opponent in a constant guessing game. Upon landing on the ground, she gains a roll bonus for the rest of the turn equal to double the number of full rounds Reeves was in the air, which ticks down by 1 after every roll. While she has this roll buff she cannot gain bonus damage from this talent."
talent,Reeves,Air Dash,,0,"Reeves can choose to use her Movement Action to “air dash” by producing a wall of air beneath her, allowing her to jump off it and putting herself 1d2 spaces into the air (she can elect to only move up 1 space if she desires). If she does this, she must remain on the same horizontal plane for the duration of the movement action. If she is already airborne when she activates this, she gains +2 movement for the turn."
talent,Reeves,"Prepare For Liftoff, Jackass",,0,"When Reeves inflicts knockback, if she wants, it can bypass typical knockback resistance a unit/target may have granted either directly via mechanics or via size/weight difference. Also, Reeves can choose for any knockback she inflicts to send a hit unit directly upwards regardless of how many laws of physics that may break."
passive,Reeves,To Infinity And Beyond,,2,"Whenever Reeves succeeds an action or ability, she can’t help but try to make it succeed more extremely! Upon the successful roll, she can choose to roll again with a +2 to add on to the success and make it even more potent. This can either double the effect of the move, or alternatively add onto it by significantly augmenting it with air or explosions. She can continue to add rolls as many times as she likes, however, attempting to go for an extra roll and failing makes the entire action fail. The rolls to increase the potency of an action cannot receive any positive or negative modifiers or interrupts from sources other than Reeves herself, and only the initial roll can be countered."
passive,Reeves,Ozone Bubble,,1,"Upon successfully finishing an action using To Infinity and Beyond, Reeves can pay X/2 rounded up stamina to gain an “Ozone Bubble Charge”. X = the number of rolls performed within the chain. An Ozone Bubble Charge has an inherent stat pool of X, with any portion of it being able to be allocated to either damage, knockback, or range (which starts at 1/melee before any allocation). Whenever Reeves performs an action, she can, as an anytime action follow-up, attempt to expend an Ozone Bubble Charge to cause a small burst of air to explode at a target of her choice within the Ozone Bubble Charge’s range. If this fails, the charge is not expended unless To Infinity and Beyond was used in an attempt to boost it. If Reeves desires, instead of creating a new charge at the end of a chain, she can put X stats into a Ozone Bubble Charge she currently has stored, which costs 1 stamina to do."
ability,Reeves,Ephemeral Queen,X,0,"Reeves condenses wind and ozone into whatever shapes she desires, using it to achieve some kind of attack or effect. This ability is especially adept at knockback. This wind construct occupies X spaces, each of which must be adjacent to either another space or Reeves herself. Since these are made of air moving in patterns, it goes away after the action takes place unless Reeves chooses to pay an extra 3 stamina after succeeding the action, in which case it lasts until the end of Reeves’ next turn and is destroyed in a single attack regardless of damage. The power of this move is relative to X. In addition to its other effects, when using To Infinity and Beyond on this ability you may also double X (additively)."
ability,Reeves,Constant Combustion,3,0,"It seems punks like you need to learn who owns these streets. Crackling pure oxygen around her boots, Reeves is propelled into a 3 damage explosive kick which inflicts 1 knockback. The roll for this action explodes on 16+ (even unnaturally). In addition, each follow up or roll exploding acts as an additional kick, with you moving forwards with the knockback to continue the assault. You may use your passive to boost each hit individually, so even if one fails the whole thing doesn’t collapse. However, each time this explodes or follows up with your passive you take 1 recoil damage, and after five hits both parties are set on fire for 1d6 damage at the start of their turns. [25 Prof] Staged Blastoff - For each successful kick from Constant Combustion, you may choose to replace the kick with a different action of yours. These actions have halved effectiveness rounded down, cannot be positively augmented by anything like To Infinity and Beyond, and must be rolled for again. You also must pay stamina costs for any abilities used this way."
ability,Reeves,Vacuum Pocket,1!,1,"Reeves claps her hands together to create a bubble of ozone, which expands out and leaves an airless vacuum within. She can manipulate these bubbles by pulling them open slightly in the right ways, causing her to zoom towards a bubble while inversely that bubble is pulled into Reeves’ previous position. Upon using this, she creates one of these vacuums up to 6 spaces away and switches with it immediately. Reeves can as a 1 cost anytime do the switch with any bubbles on the field that haven’t been switched with yet this round, and has no round limit. Vacuums have 3 stamina and are immune to statuses, and when destroyed they pop dealing 1 damage to everyone adjacent to them. Once per round."
ability,Reeves,Meteorite Kick,2!,1,"Reeves briefly jumps into the air, before propelling herself with an angled divekick at high enough speeds to cause re-entry fires around her legs. This anytime lets Reeves immediately move up to 4 spaces in any direction and smash an enemy as she travels, dealing 3 damage and dragging them with her. Once per round."
ability,Reeves,Galactic Punt,3⛯,1,"Reeves smiles wickedly before unleashing a kick on an unfortunate target. However, it is not any kick, no no. Upon making contact, the target is swept up in a blinding blue light as they are sent flying to the literal stratosphere. They then zoom back down to the battlefield like a meteorite, taking 14 or more damage on impact with the ground. They leave a crater wherever they land, and their next movement is cut in half for the next two rounds. Once per combat."
weapon,Shido,Self Sword,,0,"A sword, seemingly sheathed inside Shido’s own body… or maybe made of her body? Whatever, it deals 4 damage at 1 range."
talent,Shido,Wormhole Hunter,,2,"Whenever you succeed on an action, you may pay 2 stamina and have a shadowy circle appear on the ground somewhere below or adjacent to Shido. As an anytime, you may have Shido be immediately pulled towards the marker at EXTREME SPEEDS, ignoring all terrain. This anytime is a guaranteed success and only needs to roll when used to dodge techniques. This anytime is also once per turn, although if you have multiple of these placed they all share the anytime usage. Lastly, each marker has a 1 stamina upkeep."
talent,Shido,Portable Hole,,0,"Shido has a general hammerspace within her. She can store any amount of items within herself for later retrieval, so long as the items aren’t bigger than her."
passive,Shido,Warp Storm,,0,"Whenever one of Shido’s kit mechanics causes someone or something to teleport, that thing becomes Unstable. Whenever Shido passes between any two things that are unstable, then a shock is created. This deals 1 damage to enemies, and grants +1 range on their next action to allies. The same pair of things can’t trigger this more than once a round. Shido can remove someone or something’s instability as a movement action to teleport adjacent to them, or remove her own in place of paying up to 3 stamina for an ability. Only debuff clearing effects can make you stable again. [39 Prof] I Cause All Sorts Of Problems! - Coming into physical contact with Shido makes you Unstable."
ability,Shido,Floor Master,X,1,"A massive hand made of the same warpstuff as Shido appears above an area within your sight line, before slamming down on an XxX area. This transports everyone and everything grabbed to any other location within Shido’s sight."
ability,Shido,Vector Grab,1,0,"Bonus action. From beneath Shido’s poncho a shadowy hand stretches out and closes its grasp, as a single target within her line of sight is seemingly transported adjacent to her into her grab. This happens regardless of the target’s size."
ability,Shido,Trapdoor,1,0,"A shadow appears on the ground. If an enemy passes through this tile (diagonals count), then a hand will GRAB onto them. This makes them unable to move. If they were suffering knockback, they immediately take damage equal to the knockback prevented, up to a max of 5. Lastly, they also suffer disadvantage on defensive anytimes while grabbed. This grapple lasts until the start of their next turn or until they’re next hit by an attack."
ability,Shido,Contortion Point,1,0,"Shido touches an adjacent ally as they’re filled with spatial energy. This increases the range of all of their attacks and techniques by +2. In addition roll a 1dX, where X is the current greatest range amongst their attacks (capped at d20). If they hit targets that are exactly that many spaces away, the attack deals +2 damage or +1 to any other numeric effect. This effect lasts for 2-3 rounds."
ability,Shido,Alternate Universe,?⛯,2,"Pull from the depths of another alternate reality, searching for a person who will lend you their power and summon them. This ability does not need a roll to succeed, but takes a full round action to perform and afterwards Shido blows harmlessly in the wind and is removed from combat. The person you summon acts as an alternate universe version of another character from ours, with their own (base) kit. They can act immediately when summoned. These people are not 100% conscious of their situation when summoned (the act of being suddenly shifted into another reality does that), taking orders instinctively and not questioning their situation. Any effects to or from them that would be longer lasting go away at the end of the combat. However, our world is fucked up in its own ways. Should any effectively high enough power beings desire it (AKA, the players of DBA), they may choose to break one of these characters free of their shackles and bring them into this world permanently. They can no longer be summoned by this ability, and can be used as a PC or NPC of the person that took them. Doing this to more than one character at a time comes with stipulations, however. This ability is treated as an Outclass level ability for the purposes of copying, and when done so that instance of the ability becomes connected to an entirely different alternate reality. Once per combat."
weapon,The Betrayed,Ten Sword Style,,2,"Remnants of the mythical weapons used to strike you down, you wield a grand total of ten swords. Each sword does a base 4 damage but you gain access to special effects and/or increased damage on the sword of the specific member of the Ten who is currently active, as well as being able to take multiple attacks in a turn as long as you continue to succeed and it is a sword different to the ones you have already used. - Actor - A kendo sword made for the purpose of plays to act in place of a sword, in his own hands it was surprisingly lethal. You have an increased exploding die range of 9+ while using this one. [10 Prof] Choose One of your swords, that sword is now always at full power regardless if their owner is present or not. - Honorable - A proper katana, 8 damage when used against your passive enemy, 6 against anyone else. - Burnt - A sword with their smoking pipe at the base. As an anytime action once per round you can create a dark smoke to obfuscate an attack towards you. - Excellent - A rather expensive and exotic sword from a far off land, it puts a tax on those it cuts for 5 damage, healing you for 2 stamina. [33 Prof] Choose Another One of your swords, that sword is now always at full power regardless if their owner is present or not. - Luxurious - A sword that smells faintly of lilac, as a move action you may take a deep breath to calm yourself down and increase you next roll by 4. - Learned - A blade made of folded paper which causes papercuts, causes a stack of bleed. - Brash - Along with their cutting words The Brash used a cutting sword(which has their own cutting words). Deals 4 emotional damage and inflicts a minus to the target’s next roll.  - Foreigner - A saber made of the stars themselves, does 5 true damage. - Mirror - A simple gladius which obtains the damage and special properties (knockback, reach, status effects. etc) of your current passive enemy. - Assassin - A dagger designed for the express purpose of killing, a critical hit with this weapon that would knock out a target kills them instead."
weapon,The Betrayed,Sword of Eternity Slaying,,0,"That fuuuuuuucking tall weirdo gave me this. 2 range 6 damage, when used against an entity with some sort of immortality (either conceptual or literal) it deals +3 damage."
talent,The Betrayed,Shadows Die Twice,,1,"You have to be knocked out twice per combat to actually go unconscious, you get set to one after you would first go unconscious and the second must be by the hand of your current target of your passive, unless they themselves are already unconscious, at which case costs or any other damage/effects can take you out."
passive,The Betrayed,The Almighty X,,0,"The ones who betrayed you cursed you with a wicked form of immortality that you would have to face them again and again until the end of time along with making you fundamentally weaker than all others. At the start of combat one character (friend or foe) is selected randomly and you roll a d10 exploding to determine which of the council flows through them, that character gains passive effects relevant to which result(s) you roll. If you get a ten and then get another ten etc they are treated as having each of the highest results until you either obtain all of them or stop rolling ten. Oh by the way, that d10 exploding? Yeah you roll that instead of d20s. You also only get proficiency if you get a minimum of 2 10s in a row(cus nat 20), but at least it's on any roll not just abilities. Also since you still scale off the d20 system getting like a 26 or something means you Over-succeed so have fun with those potential bonuses the rolls will accrue, however your chances for success are much lower than the normal person."
ability,The Betrayed,Roll Slice,1!,1,"Force either an ally or an enemy to reroll by cutting their dice in half, having to use your dice mechanic. Once per round. [43 Prof] Roll Slice is now twice per round, can only be used on an instance of a roll once."

ability,The Betrayed,Legendary Remnants: Tokens of Friendship,1,0,"In the same way that your swords are fragmented replicas of the weapons your former comrades used you can create other items they had. Roll a d10 and pull one out. You can only use one item at a time, this is a free action to pull out. You will learn what each result has as you use this ability."
weapon,Vega,Caledfwlch,,0,"Using her epithet, Vega manifests a large glowing greatsword which she easily swings with one hand, disappearing after use. This deals 5 damage at 2 range."
talent,Vega,Baton Pass,,1,"Whenever a member of the party knocks an enemy prone, they can immediately pass a main action to an adjacent ally."
passive,Vega,Beyond The Boundary,,1,"All allies, including yourself, can stretch the definitions of their epithets much further than usual and perform powers/feats outside of their usual kits through this. Those without epithets instead feel their usual skills enhanced to the extent that they can be pushed past the usual limits of their kits."
ability,Vega,Ride Me To The Moon,X,0,"Using her epithet, Vega tries to send a numeric value “soaring”. Anything changed returns to their previous state at the end of combat, or shorter. Cost is determined by the magnitude of the change, for example "
ability,Vega,Team Building,3,2,"Vega points out two of her teammates (which could include herself) and tells them to figure out a dual tech. She may offer suggestions, but it’s ultimately up to them. They can then both immediately perform it as if they had a movement and action to do it (although they cannot do anything unrelated to their dual tech during this). If they succeed, and the two involved haven’t successfully dual teched through this ability before in this session, they each heal for 2."
ability,Vega,"Up, Up, And Away",1!,1,"With this ability, Vega imbues anything within line of sight with a strange sort of lifting energy to it, causing it to burst upwards into the air and/or begin to float motionlessly. Enemies in the air take slightly more damage than usual. Items set to float in the air remain until jostled with enough force. Meanwhile people can simply float back down at the cost of some movement. Vega herself can disable the floating as a free action. Once per round."
weapon,Atlas,Rocket Sword,,0,"A massive sword, which is actually just a holster for explosives on a stick. Deals 5 damage at 2 range."
weapon,Atlas,Panzer Faust,,0,"Atlas creates a warhead around his fist before PUNCHING a target! Deals 1 damage at 1 range, but gets an additional +1 damage  and +1 knockback per 2 movement Atlas has done this turn, whether from a movement action or otherwise. "
talent,Atlas,Armed and Dangerous,,0,"Whenever Atlas performs a nonmovement action, he can choose to arm an auxiliary warhead on the action. This adds one of the following benefits to the action. However, on a failure or low success, Atlas takes 3 damage via blowback from the explosive. - Move up to 6 spaces in any direction, either before or during the action. - Add up to your movement speed of knockback to an attack. - +3 damage to the attack. - Add a 3x3 3 damage 3 knockback AoE at one of the sources of the attack. Has friendly fire even on Atlas himself. - Add some RP’d effect related to an additional explosive. This explosive can be of different types than just a missile warhead."
passive,Atlas,God of Explosions,,1,"Whenever Atlas lands an attack, he rolls a 1d3. That many miniature explosives appear around Atlas, further adding to his cool factor. Each explosive can be created anywhere within 3 range of Atlas and can have one of the following effects. They cannot stack on top of each other: - Occupants of the chosen space are knocked in a chosen direction 4 spaces. - Occupants of the chosen space take 1 damage. - The explosion ambiently increases Atlas’ style, granting a +1 to all his rolls from this point on. These buffs can stack infinitely, but once Atlas is hit with an attack he loses stacks equal to the damage he took."
passive,Atlas,Containment Procedures,,0,"Whenever Atlas is hit by an AoE and other targets are getting hit by it as well, Atlas may selectively take damage and other effects inflicted by said AoE and redirect them at himself."
ability,Atlas,KO Boomer,2,0,"Atlas dashes up to 6 range in any direction as jets propel him forwards. He then grabs onto a target, creating an explosive on them, and YEETS them in any direction up to 6 spaces in range. This explosive detonates on impact, causing everyone in a 3x3 AoE centered on the target to take 4 damage."
ability,Atlas,Missile Barrage,2,1,"As a passive to this ability, whenever Atlas moves from any source, whether it be a movement action, an ability, or knockback, or he knocks enemies back he generates an equivalent amount of his red stat “Petrol”. Upon activating this ability, Atlas flaps out his cape as tons of missiles fly out from within. Atlas dumps a certain amount of red stat into this and deals damage equal to half of that amount of red stat rounded up to a target within 10 range. Afterwards, Atlas revs some of the remaining energy, spending from what red stat is left on these buffs: - 15: +1 base movement speed and +1 distance travelled on all movement and knockback effects for the rest of combat. - 20: +1 damage to all attacks for the rest of combat. - 20: +1 radius on all AoEs."
ability,Atlas,SEND 'EM TO SPACE!,3!,2,"This ability can only be used after Atlas successfully performs an attacking main action that had no anytimes or anytime effects used during its casting or in reaction to it. In return, this ability can not be reacted to by the enemy or their anytimes. Atlas creates a 5 diameter circular area that has one of the hit targets from the previous attack within it. This space turns into a transcontinental missile which gets upwards into space with the players on it before exploding. This deals 12 damage to the center target, 8 damage and 4 knockback to the targets one space from the origin, and 6 damage and 8 knockback to the targets two spaces from the origin. The targets are also knocked into the air, meaning that until they crash into the floor on their turn they have disadvantage using anytimes. Once per three rounds."
weapon,Devlin,I’m Running Out of Names to Call These Things,,0,"One of the many, many, many knives you’ve bought from the those cool shady dudes at the public marketplace, you know the ones. The problem is they’re all PIECES OF SHIT and BREAK all the time. Luckily you’re just so, *dramatic pause*, skilled at using them, that you make due. They deal 4 damage at melee range and in your coat you have, like a whole stack of like five. Maybe four or something."
passive,Devlin,Spectacular Failures,,0,"You’re so fucking terrible, that your crit fails not only fuck you up, not only fuck your team up, but they also fuck your enemies up. Basically, your crit fails fuck EVERYTHING up. These can happen in the most seemingly contrived, complicated, and majestically terrible ways the GM wants. You also crit fail on 2s, 3s, and 4s."
ability,Devlin,Please Don't Use This Ability Oh God,1!,0,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah sure. Just… make *me* deal with it... Due to your epithet, whenever an ally fails a roll, their failure can instead be pawned off to you, causing you to fail your next roll as if you had that roll instead while the allies roll succeeds, although on especially low rolls their ability might still be a little weaker than normal. Once per turn, and can be forcefully activated by allies. But like… please don’t? Please? I’m asking as a friend."
ability,Devlin,Driver's License,3,0,"Wow! Old pathetic Devlin doesn’t have shit on the others right!? Ryder’s got a motorcycle? Seda’s a fucking ghost!? Mom’s got swords n shit!?! Well guess fucking what! GUESS WHO HAS THE FUCKING CAR IN THE FAMILY!!! SUCK IT, MOM! (summons your car)"
ability,Devlin,Maelstrom of Accidents,2,0,"Devlin snaps his fingers and uses his epithet to conjure up some kind of natural disaster or horrible event to fuck with and decimate his enemies! There’s just one problem: he’s kinda awful at it. Instead of rolling for success, the ability automatically “succeeds”, however instead the roll determines how beneficial and/or detrimental it is for you and your team. 11 and above lean positive, while 10 and below lean negative. Devlin at least gets to choose what kind of disaster it is… right?"
weapon,Domanic,Myself,,0,"Shapeshift one of my fleshy fleecy wet appendages into some kind of bone spike or claw or whatever, dealing 6 damage at melee range."
passive,Domanic,Everything In My House Belongs To Me!,,0,"Within your sphere of influence, all belongs to you! People like to say that home is where your heart is, so the 2 spaces radius around you is your Domain, a realm that is mysteriously linked with your actual house that’s… somewhere. Within this area you can freely control and warp all matter within. I Got A House Extension Today (0) - +1 range to my Domain radius."
ability,Domanic,I Have a Lot of Things in My House...,3,0,I like to collect many things in my house. This causes one of them to materialize within my zone. They’re generally horrifying eldritch creatures or artifacts that defy mortal logic. You know. Things.
ability,Domanic,These Are My Clothes,1,0,"I can morph and stretch my body into a form that suits me more today. Like a new pair of clothes. This can be however I like it, although the snapping of sinew tends to annoy me, so I take 1 annoyance damage every turn I keep up the form."
ability,Domanic,I Don't Know Why I Invited You Here,2!,0,"I create a spacial tear within my Domain that drops things into my House! I can resummon it into my Domain as a bonus action on my turn whenever. I can have it return with some fucked up warping or whatever since it was in my House after all. And once it enters your House, it’s yours forever!"
weapon,Meridian,Blue Marbles,,0,"Meridian throws a marble at an enemy, dealing 3 damage at 3 range. She can spend time to throw multiple at once from different timelines, adding 1 to damage and range for each spent."
weapon,Meridian,Lævateinn,,0,"The standard-issue weapon for Time Cops. It sure is a shame that they never actually give it to agents whenever they get sent on deployments for some stupid bureaucratic reason. A Spindly Clockhand in the form of a grandfather clock’s, 2 space range 7 chronal damage. Anyone pierced by the blade it has is left with a Timeless Wound, which May Or May Not shave some Time from their overall lifespan which is then transferred to you.

passive,Meridian,Time On My Side,,0,"Meridian’s red stat is her Time. She can spend it on various abilities, as well as to add +2 to her movement for each point spent. You can gain time through the following methods: - +1 at the start of your turn. - Using an ability gives you Time equal to the amount of stamina you payed. [39 Prof] Pocket Watch of Blood - When you would take damage from all attack you get half of the damage (rounding up) as Time. [56 Prof] Man that’s a probably cursed pocket watch with all that blood - You now gain the “half time” effect from all damage you take instead of only from melee attacks."
ability,Meridian,Give Me A Minute,3,2,An ally takes a turn instead of you.
ability,Meridian,Destructo Dial,1!,2,"Cause versions of an action to phase in from other timelines. Each 3 time spent on this ability adds another version of the targeted action to happen, but each one has to roll for success separately. [35 Prof] It only costs 2 time to add in alternate copies when using destructo dial now."

ability,Meridian,Give Me A Second,1!,0,Allow an ally to do an anytime action instead of using one yourself. Once per round.
weapon,Palace,The Devil's Handiwork,,0,"Palace is trained in many martial arts that allows him to at least try and put up a fight even without his powers. Deals 5 damage at 1 range. However, when attacking Palace can choose to sacrifice 1 overall damage to split the attack into an additional dice roll. For example, Palace can choose to instead attack for 4 damage via two different 2 damage strikes that are rolled for separately. He can split it again into three different 1 damage strikes since that turns the overall net damage to 3, which is reduced twice from 5 since he’s splitting it into two additional attacks. If an attack split this way would have a base 0 or less damage it isn’t rolled.
"
weapon,Palace,Worldforger Crucible,,1,"Palace condenses hellish energy into a massive warhammer before bashing it over the head of his enemies. This deals 9 damage at 1 range. This attack is strong enough that it cannot be blocked or weakened, with the only option to avoid damage being to dodge. Lvl 2: +1 damage. The Worldforger Crucible hits so hard that the target becomes dazed, being unable to perform anytime actions until the end of Palace’s following turn. Lvl 3: +1 damage, +1 range. Lvl 4: +1 damage. The daze also causes the target to roll disadvantage on their next action."
talent,Palace,Defy Death,,2,"When Palace would be reduced to 0 or less stamina the first time in a combat, he channels unholy energy to force his soul back into his body and revives with 5 stamina left. Lvl 2: +1d4 healing. Lvl 3: +1d4 healing. If Palace has already used his once per combat revive but has six things unlocked (regardless of level) in his Binding Queue, he can get another revive at the cost of relocking them all at their base level. Lvl 4: +1d4 healing. Upon reviving, Palace begins to take the fight “seriously”, throwing off his cape and gaining a second turn in initiative."
talent,Palace,Power Paradox,,1,"Palace is so in tune with his energy that he can channel it more effectively. If an ability of his is used and succeeds, he gets 1 stamina refunded back to him from the cost. Lvl 2: Abilities of 2 cost or greater refund 2 stamina if successful instead of 1. Lvl 3: Abilities of 3 cost or greater refund 3 stamina if successful instead of 2. Lvl 4: This passive now triggers even if the move fails."
talent,Palace,Original Sin,,1,I'm not fucking copying this one. You get to look it up on palace's sheet.
passive,Palace,"Energy, Bound",,0,"Palace gets all of his abilities and talents from the start. Instead of choosing which to get, you get to decide the “order” of them in his “Binding Queue” at character creation so long as they have a ⌧. While he may have everything in his sheet, Palace doesn’t get access to everything and has to re-unlock his kit every combat if it has a ⌧, a signifier that it is locked by this passive. The first thing in your Binding Queue is always unlocked at level 1 from the start of combat, meaning you have access to it. Whenever you perform a roll or land an attack, you move the “cursor” down the Binding Queue by one. Then, once per round at the start of his turn, Palace gets a point in his red stat, his Unleashing. He can spend Unleashing as free actions on his turn to unlock whatever his cursor is currently over, letting him actually use that part of his kit. If he chooses to “unlock” something he already has, then it is instead boosted up a level to strengthen its effects, with a max level count of 4. Alternatively, he can spend the free action to move the cursor another space down. Once the cursor reaches the end of the queue it loops to the beginning. You get the stamina modifier of the first talent in your queue. When gaining new parts of his kit, if it is signified to be another thing that is locked by this passive, you get to choose where in the queue to slot it upon getting it. Alternatively, you can choose to permanently forego that upgrade to instead get either: - +1 crit range. - +1 movement. - +2 basic attack damage."
ability,Palace,Orb of Iconoclasm,1,1,"Palace condenses occult energy into a powerful sphere of raw energy, before firing it forwards at high speeds! Deals 8 damage at 8 range. Lvl 2: +1 damage, +1 range. Palace can now choose to have the projectile travel across the ground instead of through the air. This means that your opponent can risk it all and roll to dodge the attack for free, but if they fail then you get another follow up action on them. Lvl 3: +1 damage, +1 range. Orb of Iconoclasm can now pierce through targets, although past the first target the damage is halved. Lvl 4: +1 damage, +1 range. While charging the orb, it can still deal damage. Before the projectile is launched, he can have it occupy an adjacent space while being charged, dealing 5 damage to that target. Palace can also choose to not fire it and instead keep it in that spot on him for 1d4 rounds, letting him damage people passively and through movement while moving around."
ability,Palace,The Godpress,3,1,"Palace dashes at full speed towards a target in a straight direction. This lets him move a total of 10 movement speed, grabbing a single target he runs into to slam into a wall or the ground, dealing 5 damage. If against a wall, he can add damage equal to half the unexpended movement to the attack rounded up. Lvl 2: If this ability succeeds Palace can immediately perform another action that isn’t Godpress. Lvl 3: The “movement” of this ability now acts as an infinite range directional attack, meaning you are guaranteed to drag someone to the wall. For bonus damage against the wall, it is now calculated as always being a +5, effectively increasing the base damage to 10. Lvl 4: Before slamming them in, Palace creates some kind of shape or object to slam the target with or into to add bonus effects and increase damage, based on the object used of course."
ability,Palace,Omnipresence Shift,1!,1,"Palace is able to bend space in order to teleport into a location within his line of sight. This can dodge attacks. Once per round. Lvl 2: Can now be used after using an action to make it a “fake out”, letting you perform another main action afterwards. Lvl 3: Becomes a twice per round. Lvl 4: Palace can now passively fly and hover while this ability is at level 4. This ability no longer costs stamina to use."
ability,Palace,Molded Crucifix,2!,1,"Imprinting pure vile energy with his own body, Palace is able to create spectral “copies” of himself that move around and do his bidding. This summons 2-3 of them, each of which can either collide into an enemy for 1 damage or collectively perform a combo technique to dramatically boost another action done by Palace himself or an ally. Lvl 2: The copies can now use weaker versions of abilities and weapons Palace currently has access to. They’re each about the power of ¼th of a usage. Lvl 3: Palace can send out clones to “take” hits for himself or allies. Lvl 4: Palace can overlay a copy on top of someone before turning the clone into solid hell metal. This freezes the target within, forcing them to roll to break out or suffer 1d4 exploding dice suffocation damage."
ability,Palace,Occult Art,3⛯,1,"Instead of being an ability that gets stronger with each level up, Occult Art acts as a new once per combat for each level that it is at. This means that each level’s once per combat usage is separate from each other. Lvl 1: Genocide Wave - Once per combat Palace focuses all of his energy and rage deep within his core before screaming as loud as possible, projecting the energy forwards in a 3xInfinite beam attack. This deals a total of 16 damage, but must be split up against multiple targets. Lvl 2: Wyrmwood’s Corona - Once per combat Palace unfurls wings made of glowing green necrotic energy before unleashing a wave across the entire stage. This deals 8 damage to all allies and enemies in the fight. This move cannot be stopped, blocked, or avoided, and the damage can only be reduced to 4 at its lowest. Lvl 3: Massacre Reaper - Once per combat Palace enters a special stance and dashes up to 6 spaces away. When he connects with his enemy, they’re immediately rushed by a flurry of empowered dark energy attack from all sides, dealing 5d4 damage with exploding dice. Afterwards, the target crumples to the ground while Palace stands strong wreathed in vile power. Lvl 4: Empty Casket - Named after what will be present at the target’s funeral, Palace proceeds to channel enough energy that he activates all three of his other Occult Arts at the same time with this single roll. Once per combat, and costs 9 stamina instead of 3."
weapon,Philyra,Mega Mallots!,,0,"Philyra can summon massive wooden hammers, whose head has a diameter almost as large as she is tall. They reverberate like drums when someone gets inevitably whacked by one. They deal 4 damage at melee range, and your passive is much stronger when being used with this."
talent,Philyra,I’ve Got a Good Rhythm Going,,0,"Everything you do builds up a song in your head! During a round keep track of your actions. If you perform an attack successfully, count that as one beat for the round. After four rounds, save that beat down. You have advantage when rolling to perform that same series again (if you have attacks you need to perform still in a round they get advantage, if you don’t your non-attacks get advantage). If you fail, then you lose the whole thing and have to start over."
passive,Philyra,Gimme a Beat,,0,"All of Philyra’s actions create shockwaves, the intensity of which she decides. Punching, hitting with her hammers, jumping, even her footsteps create shockwaves. She can use this to launch things around with tons of knockback applied to whatever she does."
ability,Philyra,Rhythm Echo,1,0,"Using her soundwave powers, Philyra changes her footsteps in a way to create waves that disrupt people’s perception. This allows her to create many illusory clones of herself. She can make 4-8 of them at a time. Attacking a fake causes it to disappear but deals no damage to Philyra. If you perform an attack, the copies are dispelled and you gain advantage (additive with your talent) and +3 to the damage of the roll. Anytimes trying to interrupt that boosted attack roll with disadvantage."
ability,Philyra,Pinball Panic,1!,1,"After anyone is affected by any kind of knockback, whether it be from any of your own abilities or another source, you can immediately dash to somewhere in front of where they’ll be knocked to and hit them with your hammer, dealing your basic attack damage and reflecting all of their knockback and then some into another direction. If this succeeds, you can do it again, to a maximum chain of two Pinball Panics."
ability,Philyra,Percussion Solo,3,0,"Philyra sets up some mallets like a drum set and goes all out! This lets her channel the energy of the percussive blasts in a more controlled manner. She can create up to three shockwaves anywhere on the map at whatever magnitude and direction she desires to knock things around with. These don’t do damage, but can potentially set up damaging combos. It also knocks anyone adjacent to her back a couple spaces as well due to the intensity of the solo."
weapon,Tryx,There Was No Weapon The Whole Time,,0,"Nothing, but somehow deals 4 melee damage."
ability,Tryx,"Ooh, What Do These Ones Do",1!,0,"Once per round Tryx mixes two chemical formulas together. He can store whatever he makes to use as an anytime later. The issue is he has no idea what they even do! He can mix them in one of two ways: - Vial - Thrown 25 feet, Explodes on contact, causing its effect to everyone on and adjacent to where it lands. - Potion - Swigged to put effects on the consumer. The effect is determined by rolling a 2d8, each d8 is for a different table. https://i.imgur.com/6RwltLI.png"
weapon,Zephyr,The Zeitgeist,,2,"Zephyr wields a massive, curved cleaver segmented into 3 separate segments. These segments can fold into themselves and be rearranged in any order Zephyr desires. Depending on which one is on the end of the cleaver, the weapon gains a special property, but no matter what, it deals 7 damage and has 2 range as a base. Segment changes can be done once per turn as a free action. Zodiac Stance: Ox - When the Ox Segment is at the end of the cleaver, Zephyr can charge up a more powerful slash using an action. While charging, her movement is reduced to 2, but when she releases the slash, she zooms 4 spaces in a given direction. If this manages to hit someone, Zephyr can take another action on that turn. Zodiac Stance: Boar - When the Boar Segment is at the end of the cleaver, Zephyr taps into the boar’s greedy nature and is able to absorb health from her opponents when she damages them. Zodiac Stance: Dog - When the Dog Segment is at the end of the cleaver, its inner guard dog awakens, and Zephyr can now perform one attack of opportunity per round. Zodiac Stance: Sheep - Much like the Drunken Fist fighting style, your seemingly lazy movements are actually preplanned. Whenever someone attacks you but misses while you have this stance, you get a counterattack. Zodiac Stance: Horse - The witty nature of the horse means that after you land an attack, you can roll to do a taunt. If you succeed, the enemy can only attack you for the next round."
talent,Zephyr,High Paying Job,,0,"Being a bounty hunter, Zephyr is aware of all the criminals that are worth a pretty penny. As such, directly knocking out characters that are known criminals nets her an extra proficiency point."
talent,Zephyr,MSRP,,1,"Reduce the cost of all of your abilities by 1, to a minimum of 0."
passive,Zephyr,End of The Alphabet,,2,"No way Zephyr is going down before the bitter end. Due to her Epithet, her fighting spirit is unable to be extinguished unless she is the last person on her team standing, making it so she MUST be the last person on a team to be knocked out. Otherwise, she’ll always hang on with 1 stamina point left. However, if Zephyr knocks herself out in any way, this passive does not save her. Zephyr’s passive now protects her from being knocked out via stamina damage, letting her use abilities AND stay alive. However, this doesn’t apply to her zodiac stances, so if she uses those she will take the one cost and be knocked out."
ability,Zephyr,Z-Slash,3⛯,0,"A glimmer of menacing light shines from Zephyr’s eyes as she performs a quick series of slashes with her cleaver in the pattern of the letter “Z”. Doing this allows her to direct a burst of slashing energy in the same pattern somewhere visible on the battlefield, damaging anyone within it. This blast can be any size Zephyr desires so long as it follows a Z Pattern, with each line being equivalent in size. It deals a sizeable amount of damage and has variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Once per combat. Zodiac Stance: Snake - When utilizing the Snake Stance, the area Zephyr covers is not initially revealed to anyone besides the GM. Instead, it stays invisible until someone walks through it, setting off the trap and dealing even more damage than usual. If someone is standing in the area as the trap is being set, it does not activate due to their presence unless they leave the area and come back. Zodiac Stance: Dragon - With the flames of a powerful dragon at her command, this ability gains a fire element. This makes it so the initial blast isn’t quite as powerful, but it does inflict a Burn Status Effect that deals 1d6 damage at the start of each turn, and the flames also remain on the field after the initial activation. Zodiac Stance: Ox - With this stance, the slash has a dragging property, where it brings any units it hits along the way to the end of its path. Zodiac Stance: Tiger - Your slashes leave marks on your enemies. These “stripes” cause anyone attacking from either end of where the slash is left to deal +2 damage, and the person hit can’t use abilities in that direction (including anytimes). These last for the rest of combat. Zodiac Stance: Rabbit - Zephyr speeds along the Z-Slash’s distance, leaving her at an end of her slash. Zodiac Stance: Sheep - The group mentality of the sheep can be weaponized by the Z-Slash, causing all enemies adjacent to where the slash would be to get pulled into the path of it while it activates."
ability,Zephyr,Zipperwoman,1,0,"Zephyr quickly and discreetly creates a zipper on an object within about 2 spaces of her. From there, she can “unzip” something, allowing her to open any object up and then reclose. She can open and close zippers telepathically and dispel zippers as an anytime bonus action.This has different variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Zodiac Stance: Horse - The speed of the horse allows you to perform this action as a once per round anytime. This includes you using it on your turn, so you can’t use Zipperwoman as your main action and then later that round use this stance to perform it again. Zodiac Stance: Snake - Much like a snake, you can have your created zippers coil around something completely. This allows you to detach that thing into two objects. If you separate the halves and the zippers are still there, you can reattach them, or even attach one half to another set of zippers. Dispelling this makes the change permanent, although living creatures can refuze body parts with some time after combat, and you can always help out and reattach things where they should be. Zodiac Stance: Rooster - Uhh… alarm clocks sure get “in your head” and drive you crazy right? Yeah that’s enough of a connection. Create a zipper across a person and enter them to use them as both cover. You can use your actions to control the other person, although you have to roll for both your movements and actions as this, on top of the actual person having to roll. You share all non-stamina cost damage between the two of you, however the possessed person can spend their action to attempt to reopen the zipper on them and get you out."
ability,Zephyr,Zpeeding Bullet,2!,1,"Zephyr has noticed that, a lot of the time, things that are revving up and/or speeding away make a “ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ” sound. So, she’s decided to use this to her advantage by forcing something to zip and zoom away at an incredible speed. This can be used on herself if she so desires. This has different variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Once per round. Zodiac Stance: Tiger - Leaping like a ferocious tiger, Zephyr uses this on herself to pounce directly towards a chosen unit and grapple them with newly grow claws. Zodiac Stance: Rabbit - This stance causes the target to bounce multiple times instead of simply flying away. This deals slight damage and can get them to areas they wouldn’t be able to otherwise. Zodiac Stance: Rat - Instead of forcing a singular object to move, Zephyr chooses a specific point on the battlefield that forces all nearby units to scatter away from it. The closer they are to the point, the more they are affected. Zodiac Stance: Rooster - Manipulate the astral bodies slightly, either raising or lowering the sun, moon, stars, satellites, asteroids, other planets, or something similar. This can let you change day/night states for some effects, create glints or dark spots to blind people, or even “align the stars” to give an ally a reroll."
ability,Zephyr,Zenkai Boost,3⛯,0,"Tapping into the power within a certain popular anime series that happens to end with “Z”, Zephyr powers up and gains a brand new super-powered form! Her hair will often turn a different color, and she gains massive buffs of her choice. This has different variations depending on the stance she chooses (if she chooses to use one, which costs one extra stamina). Once per combat. Zodiac Stance: Monkey - Utilizing this stance seems to give Zephyr a strange natural inclination towards “Going Super” for some reason, and allows her to continuously power up turn after turn so long as she powers some extra stamina into this ability. Zodiac Stance: Sheep - With this stance, Zephyr’s main boon from this power-up is the growth of a new body part, whether that be extra arms, horns, etc. Zodiac Stance: Dragon - When powering up, seven balls begin swirling around Zephyr, eventually flying into the air and summoning a large dragon. This dragon can either be used as a familiar in combat, or in order to grant a wish. If the GM doesn’t like a particular wish, though, they can deny it."
ability,Zephyr,Zodiac Alignment,3,0,"Release the energy of a single zodiac animal, creating an ethereal version of it that will either perform an action on its own, or stay back and act as a stored buff on herself or an ally to add an effect to an action. When you do this for an animal, then using stances of that animal costs no additional stamina until you use this again with a different animal or until end of combat."
weapon,Mistos,Scalpel,,0,"A tiny scalpel Mistos carries on hand. Deals 3 damage at 1 range, but has a +3 critical hit range."
talent,Mistos,|Rampant Growth|,,0,"At the start of combat at the top of initiative, Mistos chooses one of the following options. Then at the start of the next round at the top of initiative, he chooses one of the remaining two. Then at the start of the round after that the final option is chosen: - Create a twin as described in Monozygotic Fluid. - Take a move action. - Gain a +3 to defensive maneuvers for the round."
talent,Mistos,Regenerative Tissue,,2,Mistos has fast healing 3.
talent,Mistos,Emergency Stash,,1,"Mistos carries with him a series of vials with epithets he’s duplicated with Lexic Twin. By ingesting them, he can gain quite some powers. However, the ones he carries have been specially modified to only have temporary effects, allowing him to gain an epithet’s power temporarily."
passive,Mistos,Mitosis Division,,0,"Mistos’ epithet allows him to rapidly duplicate traits as well as physical things. However, without the help of his mentor his epithet is very slow and only works on the micro level. Given a full day, Mistos can duplicate a small item. By paying close attention, Mistos can notice when certain beneficial traits mutate during division and kill off what lacks those traits to eventually instill it into something. Altering minute traits can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few days, depending on emergent complexity. Anything very large or permanent however can take months, or even years."
ability,Mistos,Monozygotic Fluid,1,0,"Mistos causes runoff cells from his body to split off from himself, and like a swirling liquid it spins around and grows until it forms into an exact duplicate of Mistos himself. The twin shares the same thoughts and senses as the primary Mistos, acting as a second body for the same consciousness effectively. Since this Mistos can shift parts of its body into liquid biological matter and back, it can move through enemies as well as grates and other small passageways, and it has resistance to all forms of physical damage. However, it only has 10 stamina on its own, and for each twin that is still currently alive the ability cost for this increases by 4."
ability,Mistos,|Cell Division|,1!,0,"Mistos molds his body like a liquidy clay or non newtonian fluid, bending it out of the way of an incoming attack before reforming. Once per round."
ability,Mistos,Positive Mutation,2!,2,"Mistos focuses his epithet onto someone. For the rest of combat, a single number on their kit is doubled. This cannot effect his own epithet. Once per combat."
ability,Mistos,|Epithet Cancer|,5⛯,2,"Mistos literally gives your epithet cancer. This either doubles the stamina cost of all your epithet related abilities and actions, or sets them to 3, whichever incurs the most cost. This status lasts for up to three days, but will have its timer refreshed indefinitely if you stay within 100 meters of Mistos. If this status lasts longer than two months, then the user either loses their epithet or they die. Cannot be used on Zander Evergarden. Once per combat."
ability,Mistos,|Lexic Twin|,7,2,"Creating a special large needle in his hands, Mistos jams into an adjacent target and draws… something. Not blood, in fact nothing is “taken” from the original person. Instead, assuming that target is an epithet user, a sort of liquified “genetic” clone of that epithet’s essence is created as the shot is pulled back."
passive,Szilard,"Take It Apart, See How It Ticks",,2,"Szilard’s epithet allows her to take apart anything so long as she understands how it works, even the metaphysical. She is immune to any effects which she understands how they work."
ability,Szilard,Remove Power,3,2,"Szilard focuses on a target, and causes their powers to break down. This allows you to remove any talent, passive, ability, or even weapon from their kit for the rest of combat so long as you understand how it works. If you don’t, the ability automatically fails."
ability,Szilard,Structural Analysis,X,0,"Szilard causes an area up to XxX in size to be taken apart into its bare pieces. This effectively destroys any nonliving, nonsapient, nonequipped items in the area. You cannot be within the area when used."
ability,Szilard,Instant Dismantle,1!,1,"Szilard snaps and a nearby attack breaks apart, cancelling it. Once per round."
ability,Szilard,Reverse Engineer,0,0,"Szilard attempts to recreate an ability which her passive has cancelled. This has a roll debuff, which is decreased the more she understands how the ability works."
ability,Szilard,Disenchant,3,1,"Remove any one debuff or status from an adjacent target. For the next while, you can re-apply the removed effect by using this ability again (you don’t have to, and there’s no limit to the number of stored effects)."
passive,Big John,Harmonic Carapace,,0,"Big John does not have to pay stamina costs for abilities. Whenever it is damaged, it gains 1 stack of Divine Resonance which can be used to boost its abilities (starts combat with 3). Lastly, specifically the front of the head (not the back of the head) has Godly DR 10."
weapon,Big John,Turret Shell,,0,Fires a 6 damage bullet attack at 20 range.
weapon,Big John,Turret Tractor Beam,,0,Each turret is equipped with a tractor beam to grab miscellaneous items with more finesse. This takes a target within 20 range and brings them adjacent to the turret.
ability,Big John,Resonance Lasers,0,0,"From its strange glass-like eyes, Big John fires 2 energy lasers out into the area. These beams ricochet off the air itself to home in on their targets, meaning they cannot be dodged. They deal 5 damage at 10 range each. Big John may spend Divine Resonance to shoot an additional laser each."
ability,Big John,Blade Construct,0,0,"Big John manifests a strange ethereal energy to create a large spectral sword on its area. If an enemy touches the sword, they’re immediately stopped where they are, they’re dizzied, and they take 14 damage. Big John may spend Divine Resonance to create an additional sword each."
ability,Big John,Divine Wave,0,0,"Big John releases an energy wave that covers the entire map, pushing everyone back 3 spaces + 3 spaces per Divine Resonance spent on this."
weapon,Every,Acoustic Guitar,,0,"Every swings with his signature guitar at an enemy. Despite seemingly being made out of simple wood, the thing is virtually indestructible. Deals 7 damage at 1 range, with significant knockback!"
talent,Every,Perfect Form,,0,"Every is immune to poison, is highly resistant to being knocked prone or having his movement hindered, and is immune to the effect of aging and time manipulation."
passive,Every,Spiritual Training,,2,"Every has access to a resource called Ki. He starts with an amount of ki equal to the multiples of 5 proficiency they have, and every time he lands a hit he regains one. Every may spend Ki in place of stamina, and when he does (assuming all stamina was spent with Ki) whatever that payment is going for has its effect multiplied by 1.5x."
passive,Every,Opportunistic Fighting Style,,2,"Whenever an enemy anytime is used, Every either immediately heals for 5 or can attempt a basic attack on a person in range."
passive,Every,Open Palm,,0,"At the start of each of his turns, Every may designate a direction. Any negative effect coming from that direction are automatically parried without a roll, no exceptions."
ability,Every,Lifeforce Spark,2,0,"Every puts a charged hand onto a target, and BURSTS power through them. This sends them flying 10 spaces back and deals a hearty 8 damage. It also messes with their system, causing all anytimes from the target that are using their epithet (if they have one) to automatically fail for the next round."
ability,Every,Absolute Shred,1!,2,"Every jams on his acoustic guitar, which immediately sends reverberations through his body. This lets him immediately dash anywhere within 20 spaces. Three times per round."
ability,Every,Uncontainable Power,5,1,"Raw energy is fired out in all directions, taking the shape of beams of light. An infinite line attack which comes out of all cardinal and diagonal directions of Every, dealing 9 damage. If Ki was spent on this ability, then in addition to the bonus damage Every may combine all of the beams above him after their initial firing, coagulating them into a massive draconic figurehead. This allows him to create any elemental effect anywhere within 7 range of him in a 5x5."
ability,Every,"Write That Down, Folks!",2,0,"Slamming his foot down, a continuity error seems to jolt out into the surrounding area. This allows for Every to alter something about the current scenario so long as it’s a “blink and you’ll miss it” kind of thing that only nerds who pay waaaay too much attention to DBA would notice, for example shuffling people around the map. This limiter is much weaker when using it to just alter yourself."
ability,Every,Akimbo Special,1!,1,"Every shoots with two of the MANY guns holstered on his belt. This deals 4 damage to up to two targets within 10 range. Once per round, but can be used as a main action to ignore that restriction."
ability,Every,Akimbo Akimbo Special,4!,1,"Every shoots with eight of the MANY guns holstered on his belt. This deals 4 damage to up to eight targets within 10 range. Once per round, but can be used as a main action to ignore that restriction."
ability,Every,Superhuman Subdivision,5,1,"Every can throw his shades at an enemy within 10 range. Whether this succeeds, fails, or is messed with, Every’s shades teleport back to his face afterwards. When this hits an enemy, Every immediately appears adjacent to the target as if moving at blinding speeds, and proceeds to “jam out” on their stupid fucking face. This deals 10 base damage, + 2d4 exploding damage. He finishes this barrage off with a massive gambit: the target must pick heads or tails correctly on a coin flip. If they fail, Every capitalizes and does one last 10 damage and 10 knockback hit. Ki must be spent to use this move and no usual multiplier is applied to it."
weapon,Vergil,Yamato,,0,"Vergil’s signature demon slaying sword. Whereas Rebellion can unite, Yamato splits asunder. Deals 6 damage at 2 range, and pierces all forms of passive protection. Its blade can cut through anything, meaning it cannot be blocked or parried, only dodged. If this critically succeeds on hitting someone, then a part of their kit of Vergil’s choice is cut off from them until they can deal 10 damage to Vergil or after two rounds."
weapon,Vergil,Beowulf,,0,Vergil delivers a powerful kick from these light-enhanced gauntlets on his hands and feet. Deals 7 damage at 1 range.

passive,Vergil,Devil Trigger,,1,"Every time Vergil does something POWERFUL or MOTIVATED, whether through his actions or otherwise, he gains a few points towards his Devil Trigger Red Stat.

ability,Vergil,Judgment Cut,3,0,"Vergil cuts with Yamato so fast that it cannot be seen, as space itself is rended. This creates an infinite line attack that will deal 20 damage to anyone in its area at the start of Vergil’s next turn. Only Judgement Cut can be used out of this move with Combo Hunter, as it doesn’t technically “hit” immediately even if the line is placed over an enemy."
ability,Vergil,Aerial Rave,1!,1,"Vergil cuts with Yamato at high speeds, dealing 6 damage at 1 range. Once per round."
ability,Vergil,The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour,3⛯,1,"Vergil presses the pause button on his TV remote, causing time to stop momentarily. This allows Vergil to perform an entire round of combat as if he is the only one able to perform any kind of action. Once per combat."
weapon,Arezzo,Omni-Weapon,,1,"A powerful straight to knock ya into next week! Has a base of 7 damage at 1 range, however Izod can utilize her epithet to modify her fists to magnify her attack beyond human limits by spending stamina. For each stamina spent, she can either increase the stats of the weapon by 3 (allocated how she sees fit), or add a single status or weird trait to the attack. She can only spend a maximum of 5 stamina on this weapon."
talent,Arezzo,Epithet Aficianado,,0,"As the creator of the Chimeras and thus the first inventor of a Stygian interface, Arezzo can basically immediately understand someone’s epithet abilities at a glance."
talent,Arezzo,Big Buff Cheeto Puff,,0,"Arezzo is big, and she lifts. She has advantage on all strength checks, can perform physical feats of superhuman proportions, and is a 2x2."
passive,Arezzo,Rough Draft,,1,"At the start of Dr. Izod’s turns, she may spend any amount of stamina she chooses. For each stamina paid, she can make a small alteration to herself, or her kit. These can be stacked together to create larger alterations if she chooses. She can’t spend more than 3 stamina in a turn with this, and caps at 25 current changes. Changes go away at the end of combat."
ability,Arezzo,Revision Notes,3!,2,"Izod’s epithet collapses around a target, permanently altering a part of their kit. Izod cannot use this on herself. The extremity of this alteration depends on the time dedicated to this. An anytime change is very small. Inversely, if given a couple months an ability could be completely rewritten. Power level of changes can only stay roughly the same, be a sidegrade, or make it weaker. If a target wants, they can pay a combo of total 15 max stamina and/or proficiency to make the change only apply for the combat instead. Once per round."
ability,Arezzo,Scribble Prison,3,0,"Charging her arms with her epithet, Izod touches both to the ground as pencil scribbles cover the entire floor. This creates barbed wire that covers every tile on the arena. Anyone who moves over one takes 1 piercing damage for each step they take. Barbed wire lasts for a round."
ability,Arezzo,Cannon Fleet,X,0,"Izod makes X steps, leaving a cartoonish cannon with a short fuse in her wake pointing in a particular direction. Then, at the end the tip of her pointer finger is erased and turned into a barrel as she fires a bullet to ignite all the cannons to fire at once! Each cannon deals 8 damage in a line, although the bullets do not pierce. The cannons are destroyed from the force."
ability,Arezzo,Bombs Away,1,1,"Arezzo throws 2d6 (minimum 4) comical bombs up to 9 spaces away. The bombs can do one of two things: detonate immediately, dealing 4 damage in a 3x3 where it landed; OR the bomb can stay and count down. Each turn that passes increases its inevitable damage, capping at 15 damage after 11 turns after which it’ll automatically explode in a 7x7 instead. These bombs cannot damage Arezzo herself."
ability,Arezzo,"FUCK YOU, TANK",3,0,Arezzo drops a 7x7 tank somewhere on the field. Recharge evens.
ability,Arezzo,Post This Rat,1,0,"Arezzo creates a rat soldier. This fucker has a tommy gun that deals 6 damage at 6 range, and has 8 movement speed. It also gets a dodge roll against any and all incoming attacks, completely avoiding the attack on rolls equal to or above the enemy check. The rat always rolls advantage except on their dodge rolls. Can be used as a bonus action once per combat."
ability,Arezzo,BALANCE PATCH!,5⛯,2,"Everyone in combat can only use one anytime per round of any type. This is tracked by player, not unit. In addition all anytimes roll with a -3. Once per combat. However in return Arezzo loses boss action economy on her turns."
ability,Arezzo,Field of Blades,3,0,"In a 10 range cone, Arezzo stomps the ground as her epithet creates knives and serrations along the ground in that area. Everyone there takes 7 damage. The area stays on the field and deals 2 damage whenever someone starts their turn in the area"
ability,Arezzo,Making A Mockery of You,3,1,"Arezzo creates a copy of a single person on the field with her epithet. This ability has a once per combat variation where she can create copies of X people, where X is an additional stamina cost to the ability. Those copies have stamina equal to 20 instead of dying in one hit like most of your constructs"
ability,Cannae,Supreme Slash,5⛯,0,"Once per combat Cannae performs an ultimate slash by spinning the blade in her hand 180 degrees while slashing at full power. This combined with the sword's power causes everyone within a 20 space radius of Cannae to be cleaved for 16 damage, piercing all DR. She can warn people to get out of the way beforehand to save her allies, but they have to hear the message."
ability,Cannae,Whirlwind Fates,7⛯,1,"Cannae spins her blade extremely fast in her hand while performing 7 successive wide strikes. This causes, each anywhere along the screen, line attacks to appear. The first is a 7xInfinite, and their width decreases with each. Each deals 5 damage. Once per combat."
weapon,Gamer Gabby,Gamer,,1,"Instead of attacking with just any old weapon, Gamer Gabby can pull out any kind of gaming peripheral ever made. She’s able to embue it with gamer energy to act like its gamer purpose in real life. This is basically an ability that you don’t have to choose and doesn’t cost stamina."
weapon,Gamer Gabby,Wiimote Light Saber,,0,A wiimote with a beam of light flowing out the end. Deals 7 damage at melee range.
weapon,Gamer Gabby,GAMER ENERGY,,0,"Pure gamer essense fired from your palms like a fucking energy sphere or kamehameha wave. Deals 10 damage at 10 range but can only be used if you have 2 or less stamina remaining, as it is a secret forbidden gamer art only usable by elites for dire situations."
passive,Gamer Gabby,The Most Oppressed Group of All,,0,"If a glass ceiling is nearby and becomes broken, then Gamer Gabby can fly, has 10 movement, and deals triple damage until end of combat. In addition, whenever Gabby performs or is witness to an epic gamer moment, her red stat goes up by some margin determined by the GM. Once it reaches 100, the pure gamer energy crystalizes into gamer sweat, which vaporizes the Veil and reveals one of the many glass ceilings above all gamers. In The Zone - Gamer Gabby gets a +1 to damage for each 20 points stored in her passive."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Rise Up Gamers,2!,1,"Tell something to rise up, even yourself. It will do so. Once per round."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Infinite Shareware,1,0,"Gabby can install Fortnite or any other game she can think of onto an electronic she sees, including the phones of her enemies. This causes the device to start performing some kind of effect based on the game, like an assembly line suddenly creating blocks when installed with Minecraft. However, only consoles and gaming PCs are able to handle the full brunt of this, so installing this on lesser devices gives them a small chance to have a thermonuclear detonation due to overheating."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Save Scum,2!,1,"Reload from your previous save, resetting your stamina and position to what it was at the start of your last turn. This does not give you your actions back, but it also doesn’t reset your actions to others you’ve performed, just resets yourself. Once per round."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Guess What I Bought?,2,0,"Gamer Gabby has access to an absolutely gamer assortment of snacks and beverages. With this ability she can cause any kind one of those to suddenly appear in any location within 8 spaces of her. For example, she can cause an area to fill with doritos to make a hazardous area for people to walk. All of these can be consumed for health, but others will only gain 1 stamina back when they do. Only gamers can understand the full nutritional value of these glorious meals to heal the full amount."
passive,Gamer Gabby,I Am [sans.],,1,"At the start of combat, Gabby can choose a single character from a video game. She can perform any of their moves or use their powers. However, if those powers are higher than Gabby could reasonable attain with her current proficiency, the powers are significantly nerfed, so choose wisely you FUCK."
passive,Gamer Gabby,Video Game Logic,,0,"You can interact with reality using logic that doesn’t actually translate to reality and only really makes sense in video games, like all enemies dropping money even if their wild animals, or food healing you even if realistically that’s not how food works, etc."
ability,Gamer Gabby,Gamer Lore,3,0,"Gabby is able to take an easter egg or urban legend about a game or its development and cause it to come to life, bending to her will!"
weapon,Vegas,Dev Tools,,0,"These weapons do nothing usually. However, if used targeting some kind of electronic or while within a simulation of some kind, it allows him to alter a component within that realm. This also works on all of Vegas’ summons since they’re lore-wise game constructs."
ability,Vegas,I Just Like Talking About My *Favorite* Game,3!,1,"Interrupt some people to talk about your FAVORITE GAME, causing it to come to life and interrupt whatever the people were doing. Once per round."
ability,Vegas,Crossing The Code,3,0,"Change the coding of a person or object, altering, adding, or removing its behavior."
ability,Vegas,Invisible Wall,1!,1,"Vegas creates an invisible wall of any size, often used to block an attack and stop people from moving somewhere. The target wastes their movement as they bump into it trying to find the edge, however it’s also pretty easy to glitch through the walls if you think about it. Once per round."
weapon,Samantha,Scalpel,,0,"A small scalpel. Deals 5 damage at 1 range, and can inflict bleeding on high rolls. Can also be used to freely cut up living tissue with ease."
talent,Samantha,Can I Have A Volunteer?,,0,"If a target is willing, you automatically succeed at using your scalpel to dissect the target. You can also choose to cause the dissection to deal zero damage."
talent,Samantha,Sicko Mode,,0,"Samantha gets a little too involved in her work sometimes. Whenever she crits, she can perform an action immediately."
passive,Samantha,A Live Dissection,,1,"As Samantha cuts things apart, she starts to understand their physical makeup better. Whenever you succeed in an ability or action that involves cutting someone open or creating a wound in them, you can choose to either: - Gain advantage on using one specific ability against that specific target forever. - Learn their epithet if they have one. - Learn their weak points, giving you an expanded crit range against that target by +1 forever."
ability,Samantha,Snitches Get Stitches,1!,1,"Samantha causes needle and thread to manifest within someone that’s in 8 spaces of them. She completely controls these threads and can have them either sew up wounds in the target’s body for around a 6-8 stamina heal, or she can have the sewing needles take other nearby objects and stitch them onto the target’s body, for various purposes. Once per round."
ability,Samantha,Splay The Flesh,3,0,"Samantha sharpens her scalpel, and a split forms on something or someone within 2 range. This deals around 7 damage, and leaves a rift in the thing. On people this can be used to create a weak point that will make them take more damage, mess with an organ to cause some kind of failure in the system, or cause the target to start bleeding for a damage over time effect. Surprisingly, the target will not feel any pain during this process despite the damage."
ability,Samantha,Beyond Human,3,0,"Samantha takes out a machine and implants it into an adjacent person, cutting them open before closing the wound around the device. This gives the target some extra cybernetic functionality. What they get is chosen by Samantha."
ability,Samantha,"Go, Squeakums!",1,0,"Samantha pulls out one of her pet cybernetic rats. They have 5 stamina, 6 movement, and have both a 4 damage melee attack and a 2 damage 8 range laser beam attack. They also self-reassemble, healing 1 stamina a turn. If one dies, Samantha can use Snitches Get Stitches to straight up revive them from death as long as most of their pieces are still around."
ability,Samantha,Better Biology,3,0,"If Samantha has had her passive trigger on a target, then she can use this ability to change their internal form in some way. This alters the shape and positioning of their organs to change how they operate. While yes, this ability can be done to cause severe internal damage or weaken a target, it can also be used on an ally to significantly boost their power, making them effectively superhuman in biology. Against especially powerful targets this effect will likely not last forever. Once per combat."
weapon,James,L33t-T0P,,0,A hacker laptop that can hit in a melee range for 5 damage.
talent,James,PC Optimizer Pro,,0,Immunity to slow down or movement debuffs. Applies to you and any allies within 6 range (30 ft.)
passive,James,Tab Master,,0,"Whenever James uses a 3 cost ability, he can take something from the current scenario (whether it be an item or effect) and put it off to the side in a tab for later. These, unfortunately, tend to stack up pretty fast, so he needs to frequently go through them and close them. He can go through and check on any of his tabs to close it, which either boosts an action of his in a related way to the stored thing, or lets him summon another instance of the stored thing. However, he has to worry about using up all of his ram on these tabs, so if a roll of his is equal to or less than the number of tabs he has open he bursts into flames. This deals 1d4 damage to him over time, and can spread."
ability,James,The Google Game,X,0,"James opens a new tab and types in three characters into google incognito mode. Your choice of one of the first three autocomplete results is searched and summoned, and if a more suitable image is not found the first result for that on google images represents it. Cost is dependant on what is summoned as chosen by the DM."
ability,James,The Wiki Game,3,0,"Open up Wikipedia and access a randomly selected page. Whatever appears James manifests as an ingame effect, beneficial or not. Effect needs to be vaguely related to the page. Can only be used again after combat or when the effect is dispelled/destroyed."

ability,James,Government Secrets,1,0,"James taps into the data of a single enemy, learning some history and facts about them. High rolls can describe their abilities or even reveal a weakness. Low rolls provide information of questionable validity. "
ability,James,Close Your Tabs You FUCK,3,0,"James decides to thuroughly break the fourth wall by looking at zanza’s very window and picking a tab he has at random to close. This is chosen with a 1dX, where X is the number of tabs he has open in whichever window has the most tabs. Once this is rolled, he created an effect relating to the tab, before closing it to ensure further computer browsing hygiene. "
weapon,Nova,Euclidean Moonbuster,,0,A gun with a block-like barrel so long it can be used as a sword. Can deal 5 ranged damage at 6 spaces or 8 melee damage.
talent,Nova,Failure Is Not An Option,,0,Once per combat Nova may reroll a noncritical fail.
talent,Nova,Reflex Counter,,0,Nova can perform one non ability or weapon action as a 0 cost anytime if she didn’t do one on her turn. (for example grabbing onto attacker). This can only be done in reaction to another move.
passive,Nova,Supernova Perseverance,,0,"Nova’s red stat is her Wrath. Everytime a source deals 5 or more damage to her, Nova may add +3 to her Wrath for each multiple of 5 dealt. If it’s less than 5 damage, she gains +1 Wrath. She may spend this like stamina to use abilities. Nova starts combat with 5 red stat."
ability,Nova,Sakuga Moment,1!,1,"Nova makes a move flashier with a higher animation budget, adding +d8 to a roll."
ability,Nova,Galica Cannon Type: ~THIS~,2,0,"Nova’s Moonbuster unfolds and shifts itself in an overly complicated way before shooting something out. Roll a d1000 to determine what is launched at 8 range. Even if the roll to hit fails an object is always created. Failed rolls create the object at the barrel of the gun with no momentum, immediately dropping right in front of Nova unless specified otherwise. Effects are probably until end of combat."
ability,Nova,Giga Beam Buster,3⛯,0,"Nova charges an incredibly powerful beam attack. Too bad it’s so slow. The attack only goes off at the beginning of her next turn, but hits everything in a straight line 25 feet thick (two spaces to each side of the line which she is firing). Infinite range, deals 16 damage with friendly fire. Cannot perform a move action while charging. Once per combat."
ability,Nova,Storage War,3,0,Add an object you’re touching to your Galica Cannon list. Permanently.
ability,Nova,Death Flex,1!,0,Nova can flex the muscles on her upper body so hard and fast that it creates a shockwave. This knocks anyone and anything adjacent to her one space back and softens the blow of incoming attacks especially projectiles. Rolls 17 and above even negate attacks entirely. Only works on attacks going towards Nova and that can be theoretically repulsed.
weapon,Dean,Worst Sellers,,0,These books have a habit of not selling so you just give them away. By force! Deals 5 damage at 4 range.
talent,Dean,No Refunds,,0,"Once someone obtains one of Dean’s books, they can never get rid of it. By using some savvy marketing and legal binding contracts you’ve now made it so that anyone who even touches your book legally accepts it! This means your basic attack counts for your talent. It also means that you can choose to say where you throw the book at (for a minus 3 roll penalty) to make it really difficult for a person to properly use that part of their body."
passive,Dean,Ghostwriter,,0,"Dean obviously can’t write himself, but he “luckily” doesn’t have to! A spirit named Dan is chained to Dean at all times, which has above average writing ability. Dean can force it to write anything he wants, creating any written document or piece of paper, book, etc. as a once per round free action. "
ability,Dean,"It's Called ""Inspiration""",1,0,"This ability is replaced for the rest of combat with any ability Dean has ever seen done successfully, at 1.5X stamina cost rounded up. The ability is rephrased for legal reasons (this is just for flavor). You can never use an ability you’ve copied ever again."
ability,Dean,Who Needs An Editor?,1!,0,"Dean creates a typo, adding, removing, or changing a character (letter, symbol, space, ect) of anything. Anything. Effects are as far-reaching as Dean intends. Infinite range. Once per combat this can be used to add, remove, or change a full word. Dean can only mess with numbers by increasing or decreasing them by 2, can’t take them below zero, and can’t effect stamina costs except on high rolls. Can be used as a once per round anytime, but using it as a main action does not consume this usage."
ability,Dean,Dean Stu To The Rescue,3,1,"Dean’s such a good protagonist, he has a second epithet! Roll six random words and choose one. This ability is replaced until end of combat with a new ability themed around that word, as if Dean had that new word as an epithet."
ability,Dean,Original Characta,3,1,"Dean targets one person he can see and writes a rough draft of his newest character. This character with a Completely Original name and theme is then summoned. He can only have one OC summoned at a time because giving more than one Character proper focus is way too much work and each Summon has 8 stamina. Summons may use slightly altered versions of their inspiration’s Abilities, the changes being related to whatever creative license was used in their conception."
weapon,Emrick,Dual Demon Pincer Attack,,0,The full fury of two giant lobster claws. Emrick has learned how to really make them sting. 5 damage 1 range.
talent,Emrick,Scary Swimmer,,0,Emrick gains 1.5x movement while swimming.
talent,Emrick,Elemental Bending,,0,"The eldest of vampires gain the power to bend an element, and Emrick is no different! Emrick now has the power to create and bend water to a limited extent, and add it to actions he performs for small bonus effects."
talent,Emrick,Blood Transfusion,,0,"Instead of draining blood from others, Emrick can transfer his own will to another through a bite! He may heal them for any amount of stamina he so chooses, so long as he pays twice the stamina he gives. Doing this is a bonus action, requires you to be adjacent to the target, and they must willingly accept the gesture, however it requires no roll. Warning: if this is used to heal someone for 20 or more stamina, there’s an increasing chance they may catch vampirism themselves."
passive,Emrick,Lucky Cape,,2,"When Emrick is standing adjacent to an ally, his cape produces a lucky aura, granting them a +5 to all non-attack rolls. (Prof 42) Luck Goes Around - Emrick can now “pass on” his lucky cape, essentially transferring his passive onto a willing adjacent ally and allowing them to gain its effects constantly."
passive,Emrick,Future Providence Over The Entire World!!!,,2,"Whenever Emrick or an ally rolls a Natural 20, Emrick gets a +1 to all damage (before crit multipliers) on all his attacks for the rest of the session!"
passive,Emrick,The Undying Breed,,2,"The (fake) immortality of the Lobster and the (real) immortality of the Vampire have fully combined! If Emrick were to drop below 1 stamina, he can roll to resist. Anything 8 and above heals him for the number rolled on the dice. If he rolls less then he stays unconscious until healed back by other means. There is no limit to how many times this can happen. If Emrick crits on this roll, he fully heals."
passive,Bara Bara No Mi,"Knives, Swords, Useless! The Lot of Them!",,2,"Emrick is immune to piercing and slashing damage, and when exposed to such damage, may have a body part of his separated from the main body and can move it as a free action on his turn up to 30 feet from his body. If it gets taken out of that area, he loses control of it and can still be damaged from said body part. Once per Turn, Emrick gets an extra action from a body part that isn't connected to his main body. (The Devil’s Power Grows 2) Instant Split - Emrick can split himself along any axis of his choice as an unrolled Movement Action."
ability,Emrick,Rock Lobster,3⛯,1,"Calling upon the dark power welled within him, Emrick summons a giant statue of a lobster that falls down onto a 3x3 area and stays there for the rest of combat. If it lands on an enemy, it deals 12 damage and can trap them under it on high rolls. Once per combat. (Prof Upgrade) Ever Encroaching Darkness - Rock Lobster no longer gives the targeted units a counter roll on activation. (Prof 59) Continued Assault - Emrick can continue to punch down the Rock Lobster onto enemies for an additional 10 damage against anyone pinned under it as a Main Action, at the cost of destroying it. (Prof 66) Stone Hard Will - Rock Lobster now deals +2 damage (10 to 12). (Prof 79) Leader’s Symbol - If the Rock Lobster is on the battlefield, Emrick can once per round grant advantage to any ally, so long as they can hear his words of motivation!"
ability,Emrick,Exoskeleton Safeguard,1!,1,"Emrick puts great faith and trust into his teammates, so naturally, he doesn’t want to see them hurt. Thus, he can jump in front of an ally right before they take damage, hardening his lobster exoskeleton an extreme amount so that he takes half of the original damage. When Emrick is using Heat Riser, this ability completely negates the damage of the blocked attack. Once per round. (Prof 46) Rallying Call - Emrick does more than just protect his comrades, he inspires them! Whenever he uses Exoskeleton Safeguard to protect an ally, that ally gets advantage on whatever their next roll is."
ability,Emrick,March of The Mollusks,3,0,"Vampires have an innate ability that connects them to vermin. However, seeing as Emrick is cursed, this ability has transformed into a connection with lobsters specifically. Taking advantage of this, Emrick calls upon his crustacean comrades to charge with him as he transforms into a swarm of “lobats”. This allows him to have another Move Action and to drag units along with him, dealing 2 damage for each space traveled. Transforming back to his normal form acts as a Bonus Action on his turn. Due to a combination of the swarm spreading Emrick’s mass into smaller segments and Emrick’s realization of Heat Riser’s long term repercussions to his health, any damage boost from Heat Riser is only added at the end of the attack, as opposed to being applied for each space moved. (Prof 55) Evasive Swarm - While in March of The Mollusks form non-AoE attacks against him roll with disadvantage, because as it turns out it’s quite hard to hit a swarm of lobats."
ability,Emrick,Heat Riser,X,2,"“Wasn’t that flaming hot?!”. Emrick uses vampires’ innate ability to turn into fog and combines it with lobster related experience to generate a massive amount of heat. This causes an aura of power to swell around him as steam is expelled from his body.  When activating this ability, Emrick chooses how much stamina he wants to use, and he then gains +X*2 on all damage he deals and +X to his movement. If he wants, he can activate this ability as a bonus action, but doing so halves the buffs gained. He must also pay an upkeep cost of X stamina at the start of his turns to maintain this form regardless of the variation. If he fails to use this ability, he pays 3 stamina no matter what."
ability,Emrick,Space Ripper Stingy Eyes,3,0,"Emrick shoots scalding salt water from his eyes like a pressurized hose, dealing 6 damage as a 1xInfinite line attack, with +3 damage against legendary heroe- I mean units Class 2 and above."
ability,Emrick,Emperor's Eye,0!,1,"Emrick glares down at an enemy with the might and confidence of the future tyrant of the entire world, as his vampiric powers assert influence over the target. This causes any enemy who can make direct eye contact with Emrick to be instantly knocked prone. Once per Round."
ability,Bara Bara No Mi,Chop Shop,1!,1,Emrick can take any amount of his split off pieces and reconstruct them into a new form with some minor new benefit to suit it. Undoing this is a Free Action.
talent,Emrick,The Curse Controlled,,0,"By paying an extra 1 stamina, Emrick can let his curse envelop an action of his to add some kind of lobster-y effect to it. However, if you do this and your action fails you will be forced back into your Lobster curse kit until the start of your next turn."
talent,Emrick,Vampire Regeneration,,1,Emrick has fast healing 2.
talent,Emrick,Flight,,0,Emrick can fly at will.
talent,Emrick,Vampire Speed,,0,Emrick has doubled movement speed
talent,Emrick,Levitation,,0,"Emrick can levitate and control small objects with his mind. He can use this as a bonus action, or he can control items of much larger size as a main action (although not much larger than a 4x4)."
talent,Emrick,Raven Familiar,,0,"Emrick has a raven familiar! It has 10 stamina, 7 movement, and a 1 damage melee peck attack. It can be used for recon as the two share senses and it can communicate telepathically to him."
talent,Emrick,Child of The Night,,0,"Every vampire knows how to use darkness to their advantage, and thus, he can essentially vanish in dark areas, making him essentially invisible. Activate as a Bonus Action, and requires a roll to not take down whenever he’s hit. Obviously goes away immediately if the area he’s in becomes lit."
passive,Emrick,Infinite Ambition,,2,"Emrick Rallavar is filled with an ultimate ambition: to become a leading figure in the world, his own definition of tyrant, for the good of his friends and the rest of the world. Because of this, Emrick can push himself past his usual physical limits, and thanks to his vampiric physiology he suffers little pushback. Upon successfully performing a Main Action, Emrick may choose to push himself. If he does, then he rolls a die and takes that much irreducible damage, and can immediately perform another main action at lesser effectiveness so long as it’s different to any other action he has performed this turn. However, doing that also grants Emrick a level of Fatigue. The damage die he rolls depends on his current Fatigue. He loses 1 Fatigue at the start of his turns and whenever he supports an ally. In addition, if Emrick crits on an action, then he does not take damage for pushing himself beyond it. Upon pushing past 5 Fatigue, Emrick will be forced to choose: he can be forced to take a rest which immediately ends his turn, or he can enter Burning King state. In this state Emrick’s double movement becomes quadruple movement, he can move-act-move, and the sheer heat of his blood and soul allow him to add fire properties to any of his abilities, increasing their damage by +5 and potentially having other effects if flavored right. However, this also causes Emrick to take 10 damage a round until he is knocked out or reduces his Fatigue to 0. This damage cannot bring him below 0. If Emrick somehow instead goes even further beyond and hits 10 Fatigue, he can enter Infinite Shade Emperor state. In this state, Emrick can take two main actions and move actions whenever he pushes himself, gains eight times movement instead of quadruple, rolls advantage on all rolls, and gains special hidden critical effects on all his rolls. This stays until he is knocked out or reduced to 0 Fatigue. Emrick can potentially push himself even further hypothetically... - 1d2 - 1d4 - 1d6 - 1d8 - 1d10 - 1d12 (damage caps at this level)"
ability,Emrick,Tyrant Lance,1,0,"Emrick runs up and kicks an enemy to the floor, sliding along the ground as their face is grinded against the pavement. This ability is combined with Emrick’s movement. Once contact has been made with the enemy, both Emrick and the target will slide forwards for the rest of their movement spaces as the enemy takes 1 damage for each space traveled. They are also knocked prone due to the process. The Infinite Ambition damage die to push forwards after this technique caps at a 1d8."
ability,Emrick,Cyclone Twister,3,1,"Imbuing one of his swords with dark magics, Emrick swings as hard as he can to create a spinning tornado. This acts as a 3x3 which he can then move up to 8 spaces, hitting every area that it covers before disappearing. This tornado deals 8 damage to everyone it passes through, and drags them along its path. (4) - When using Sable with Cyclone Twister, the twister becomes an animated black being of swirling ash. This causes all spaces it passes through to be covered in black fog."
ability,Emrick,Cross Chariot,3,0,"Putting both Cherry Rain and Sable together, Emrick performs an X slash attack which travels through the air as a 3x8 piercing projectile, dealing 6 damage to all those hit. In addition, Emrick can move along with the projectile however far he wants, using the black fog as cover. If this technique hits three or more targets, then pushing forward past it with your passive incurs a damage die one size less. The same is true if you move to the very end of the travel distance, which can stack with the previous effect."
ability,Emrick,Swashbuckling Clash,3!,1,"This refined dueling technique is a guaranteed success parry of an incoming blow, as you bat away an incoming attack with both swords. However, your foe may choose to contest this parry instead of letting you style on them. If they do, they must roll higher than your roll to use this ability, and if they fail then you get an immediate attacking riposte action back at them (which cannot be pushed with Infinite Ambition) and your next Infinite Ambition damage die is reduced by one size category. If they succeed, then they simply get through for slightly less damage then would’ve been initially dealt.  Once per Round."
ability,Emrick,Mirage Step,2!,1,"Using your mystical vampiric lineage, you can confuse targets into seeing the mirage of another attack. By activating this, you can change any action you are currently performing into any other action you could perform at that time. This causes any parries/defenses/anytimes that were targeting the original to be discarded as they were only combatting a mirage, and you choose to either keep the original action’s roll or use this anytime’s roll for the replacement. Once per Round."
ability,Emrick,Ship Cutter,5⛯,1,"Emrick jumps forwards with both swords held together, before performing a legendary slash which he was famous for: the Ship Cutter. This attack deals 15 damage in a 9x9 area centered on Emrick himself, or he can do the attack vertically to make it go 4 spaces in front and behind him. It can cut through even steel, and will destroy most structures instantly. However, this technique is very dangerous as it can potentially damage his own allies in the process. Once per Combat."
ability,Emrick,Bewildering Mist,1,0,"Emrick vanishes into a 3x3 cloud of mist, and, after a moment, he and all objects and/or units in the area are repositioned to spaces within 4 of Emrick’s current position. Bonus Action."
ability,Emrick,Gale of Darkness,3,2,"Emrick flourishes his cape, casting a shadow that forms into up to 2 “Heralds of Darkness”. Heralds of Darkness have 7 stamina on average, and can perform weaker versions of Emrick’s actions. There is no limit to the amount of Heralds of Darkness able to be on the field at a given time. Heralds of Darkness become inert while in Lobster Curse form."
ability,Emrick,Midnight Resolution,4,1,"Emrick snaps, and a 4x4 area of his choice becomes subsumed in an infinitely dark black hole. Units inside have no choice but to watch as the seemingly pulsing area is pierced with countless blood spikes, dealing 10-13 damage in the process. With its final strike, the black hole explodes, sending all units inside flying in a direction of Emrick’s choice. This attack does increased damage to summons, and passes through DR."
ability,Emrick,Blood Drain,1,0,"As a vampire, you can drink the blood of your enemies. Doing this restores 1d6+1 stamina, and deals that much damage to the drained unit."
weapon,Geist,Lollipop Chainsaw,,0,"Geist reaches into her endless bag of candy and pulls out a lollipop. This lollipop then expands and transforms into a chainsaw scythe, perfect for rousing spirits. 3 damage 2 range. Trickster Spirit - Lollipop Chainsaw now has its damage and range tripled. (Prof 37) Harvest Moon - As the light of the moon on Halloween night glints off her, she seems to actively harvest from her surroundings. While Geist is in Trickster Spirit form and she deals damage to an enemy with her scythe, she can choose to either heal 3 stamina or “steal” an aspect of whatever she hit, getting a buff for herself. This only applies once per round even if she hits multiple people, and only triggers if she hits with the 2 furthest spots of its range (this sweet spot increases by 1 for every range upgrade Geist picks to compensate for bigger scythe)."
talent,Geist,Spooky Squirmings,,0,"Due to Geist’s origins as both a scarecrow and a spirit, she is able to bend her body in ways that normal people can’t. This makes her very flexible and allows her to squeeze through just about any crevice."
talent,Geist,Sweet Tooth,,0,Geist’s body seems to derive energy from Halloween itself! She gets an additional +2 healing whenever she eats any kind of candy.
talent,Geist,And Who Might You Be?,,0,"Geist gets a great joy from guessing what someone is! She gets an additional +2 proficiency whenever she successfully guesses someone’s epithet (or equivalent), on top of the usual rewards."
passive,Geist,Devil's Night,,2,"Geist always has the spirit of Hallow’s Eve swirling around inside of her, and as such, her mask is usually used to contain it all in one place. However, if Geist is able to utilize her power to its fullest, it can make her significantly scarier. Her red stat, “Halloween Spirit”, grows over time, specifically gaining 1 point passively at the start of Geist’s turn. Whenever she deals damage (either directly or through status), she also gains an equivalent amount of Halloween Spirit. Similarly, whenever she is damaged, half of the damage dealt is then added to her Halloween Spirit. When she reaches 31 Halloween Spirit, her energy reaches its max as she removes her mask and enters Trickster Spirit Form. While in this form, her movement is increased by 2, she gains a +3 on all rolls, and all of her actions gain different, incredibly potent buffs. Geist is able to maintain this form for 2 rounds before reverting to normal with 0 Halloween Spirit. Halloween Spirit carries over between combats. (Prof 35) Witching Hour - If Geist would go to 31 Halloween Spirit, she can choose to hold the moment and stay at 30 instead, in order to maximize the timing of her Trickster Spirit form!"
passive,Geist,Children of The Night,,0,"At the start of her turn, Geist may choose to activate this passive with a free action whistle. This calls in some ghostly children from the shadows, armed with eggs and toilet paper!Whenever Geist performs an attacking action, the ghosts also get to roll collectively to throw some TP and deal an additional 1 damage to the target, which adds to Geist’s passive. Rolls of 14+ apply Haunted as well. This only applies to one person per attack even if the attack hit multiple people. However, Geist has to keep paying them with candy, which costs her 2 stamina at the start of her turns"
ability,Geist,Jack-o'-Havoc,3,1,"Geist pulls out a jack-o’-lantern: a special one she carved herself! Its stem acts as a fuse, and the design carved into it can be whatever Geist wants. With a cartoonish wind-up, she tosses it somewhere up to 5 spaces away, and it explodes upon impact with either an object or the ground. The explosion hits the targeted space and all spaces adjacent to it, dealing 5 damage and inflicting a secondary effect based on the carving Geist chose. On rolls above a 13, this also inflicts the Haunted Status, dealing 1 ghost damage at the start of an afflicted unit’s next 1d3 turns. Trickster Spirit - Jack-o’-Havoc’s base range and damage are increased by 3, its explosion radius becomes 5x5, and it always inflicts the Haunted Status for 1d3 + 1 turns. (Prof 29) Bounce-o’-Rama - Jack-o’-Havoc’s bombs themselves are infused with mischievous energy, allowing them to bounce off the first thing they’re thrown on. This allows Geist, if she chooses, to double the range of her lob assuming she has something to bounce off of with a semi-reasonable trajectory to it (they can turn about 90 degrees). It also explodes on both its bounce and actual landing. However, if she does this then the radius of the explosive decreases by 2 sizes (so 3x3 goes to 1x1, and 5x5 goes to 3x3)."
ability,Geist,Trick or Treat,2!,1,"In the middle of whatever is happening, Geist pushes her finger into the air as a doorbell sound is heard. She then exclaims “Trick or Treat!” to a chosen target, while also stating the amount of stamina she would like from them as a treat. If the target gives them that amount of stamina, it is morphed into a physical candy that she or someone else can eat to heal for that much. If they refuse to give her the treat, she devilishly smiles as her mischief-making allows her to either immediately perform a basic attack against them or inflict a status of her choice upon them. Once per round. Trickster Spirit - Trick or Treat does not cost stamina to use."
ability,Geist,Curse of The Pumpkin Patch,3⛯,0,"After stomping on the ground a few times, a group of pumpkins and thorny pumpkin vines arise from the ground. Geist can choose for these to either appear in a 6 space line or in a 4x4 area around her, and any enemies that travel through the vines have their movement cut in half, and take 1 damage for each step they take while in them. If an enemy starts their turn in the vines, they also take 1 damage. Once per Combat. Trickster Spirit - The line variation of Curse of the Pumpkin Patch instead becomes a cross that reaches to the ends of the arena, and the area variation of the ability increases to 5x5 and summons a “Great Pumpkin” in its center that can deal 4 damage attacks by utilizing the vines."
ability,Geist,Shadows Stalk The Night,1!,0,"Once per round, Geist can seemingly pull and warp the shadows while lit by the jack-o-lantern flame that is Halloween! She can use this to solidify any shadow and control them to do some minor task, such as strike at an enemy (around 1-3 damage), tie someone down, or pull someone a few short spaces. Shadows can also do anything that what they’re cast from can do except for any kind of epithet powers, but they’re much weaker than the originals. You can only change one shadow at a time. Trickster Spirit - Shadows Stalk The Night has its damage increased to 3-6, and is more effective when combo-ing into or out of a move!"
ability,Geist,Throw The Shame Juice,2!,0,"Throw a potion bottle filled with fizz at anyone, casting Wild Magic upon them. Once per Round. Trickster Spirit - The fizz inside the bottle becomes highly volatile “Halloween Essence”. A jack-o-lantern face can be seen imposed on the liquid, a slight cackle can be heard, and the bottle itself vibrates. When thrown on a unit, the concoction explodes and creates a cloud of jack-o-lantern patterns that can act as an interrupt. Before or after the Wild Magic result is rolled, Geist can choose to change the result into “Happy Halloween!”, which may or may not do something depending on Geist’s roll and intent."
weapon,Googol,Transforming Tentacles,,0,"Googol slashes out with one of their tentacles, morphing it into a form of their choice in the process. Damage and range depends on the specific weapon Googol creates. (Prof 22) Gettin’ Stronger! - Transforming Tentacles deals +1 damage regardless of what form it takes."
talent,Googol,Evolve and Adapt,,0,"After long enough exposure to an environmental hazard, Googol will adapt and thus be unaffected by it. Extremely prolonged exposure may even allow Googol to gain positive effects from it. (Prof 42) Physical Alteration - Evolve and Adapt now applies to statuses and debuffs! Reminder, it still takes time to come into effect."
talent,Googol,Goopy Body,,0,"Projectiles just kind of get absorbed into Googol’s goopy mass when they get hit, halving the damage."
talent,Googol,Look at His Li’l Legs Go!,,0,"/+1 movement, regardless of the form Googol’s currently turned into."
passive,Googol,Master of Many Faces,,2,"At the start of Googol’s turn, they can choose to transform into one of the characters in their repertoire, inheriting their character sheet (excluding stamina and proficiency). Not only this, but they can also choose a second character at this time whose attributes can be applied to what Googol’s current form can do. Googol cannot maintain the same form for more than two turns. - Viktor Valentine - Timothy T.T. Tuesday Jr. - Saffron Judith Pemberton - Emrick Rallavar - Leon Neon - Retnue Throwdown - Beetlebob - Rosé Lee - Jester - Robin Rimmicks - Mr. Worldwide - Sunny Starburst - W (Camshake) - (Prof 36) Velletri Siward - (Prof 47) Kat Faedelcrane - Tesla Magnes - (Prof 77) Mistral “Misty” Willows - Donovan Bushida - Korima - Wendrow Wonderland - Aeron Noumi - Echo - Izuru Andromeda - Soph’et (Prof 44) Mental Reconstruction - Googol’s grown quite a bit! Well, in a way. When turning into a character, their mind is more resilient to the change, meaning that they subconsciously understand that they are Googol and not who they are turned into. As such, Googol can still use non-anytime abilities of his while turned into someone else. (Prof 60) Role Model Emulation - At the end of a session, Googol may choose either another character of yours or one of your allies and add that character to their transformation list! However, doing this costs 10 max stamina."
ability,Googol,Copycat Counter,2!,1,"When an attack is targeting Googol, they can counter with an exoskeleton-armored stomp using one of their appendages, which stops the attack in its tracks. They then follow up with their own version of the blocked attack with added elemental effect of either fire, electricity, ice, or shadow. Once per Round. (Prof 53) Multifarious Counter - In addition to the initial set of elements, you may choose to pick an element associated with one of the characters you can turn into for Copycat Counter!"
ability,Googol,Doppelganger Gang-Up,3,2,"Unleashing their Super Move, the surrounding area darkens as Googol unleashes a chain of successive attacks, taking the form of other entities while doing so. Each strike utilizes a pre-chosen character set, and Googol cannot use the same character twice in the same combo. If the first hit lands, the second is a guaranteed follow-up. If Googol wishes, they can continue the attack, but they must roll for each new addition to the combo, and this ability cannot be used again for the rest of combat."
ability,Googol,Optic Absolution,X,0,"Googol’s eye flashes before they launch a beam towards a chosen unit. This beam contains samples of Googol’s DNA, allowing it to take on characteristics of up to three characters. The effect and stamina cost of this ability depend on what characteristics are chosen. (Prof 81) Ultimate Rainbow - Optic Absolution no longer has a limit on how many characters Googol can use with it, although using a lot of them will obviously increase the stamina cost to exorbitant amounts. They can also split the laser into separate beams just like in their Ultimate Form, so long as the same character isn’t used in more than one beam!"
ability,Googol,Separation Theorem,1,0,"Googol separates a small amount of his mass, creating a Googolet that waddles around. Googol can see anything the little guy can see, and it can perform non-ability non-weapon standard actions. It inherits the passives that the main Googol gains from transformations (but cannot transform itself) and can of course bend and morph its body into any object for use by themselves or others. [RIDBI’S SHOWBOATING] - If Googol pays an extra stamina when using Separation Theorem, they can do a quirky little spin, making it be used as a Bonus Action as the Googolet flips off of them."
ability,Googol,Reflexive Reform,2!,1,"Googol quickly forms into a new shape. This can be into an object to be used in an action, morphing around incoming attacks, or changing what form he’s in with his passive at anytime speed! Once per Round."
ability,Googol,Double Helix,3,0,"Waving their gooey hands together, a helix pattern outstretches from Googol in a 3x7 area. Picking two of their characters from their passive, Googol can effectively create a line attack in this area so long as it has the combined properties of both characters. In addition, for each hit target he may pay 1 additional stamina to apply a debuff (or potentially buff) based on the character combo, as their genetics are temporarily spliced."
ability,Googol,Assist Automata,2!,2,"Whenever an ally successfully lands an attack, you may use this ability to quickly shift into another form as your passive says, perform an action as them to follow them up, and then quickly switch back. You cannot turn into your current form with this, unless Complete Imprint is active. Your action must be offensive in nature against one of the hit targets of the move you’re following up. You must roll for and pay costs for your follow up separately from this. Once per Round."
weapon,Lavenza,Holo-Caster,,0,"Regardless of the robot she’s currently controlling, Lavenza’s made sure to build a particular, small gun within them capable of firing “Holo-Casters”. These are very small, magnetic discs that can attach to most surfaces. Once attached it cannot only produce a hologram of Lavenza for whatever purpose that may serve, but it also also allows Lavenza to attempt to hack into a technological device given that it is attached to said device."
weapon,Lavenza,A Gun,,0,"After a particular encounter, Lavenza has become quite a bit more paranoid and has bought a gun. This gun has around 20 range and deals variable damage depending on what body part she is aiming at. This usually doesn’t mean much because she’s behind her computer screen. However, she’s outfitted her teleporter to be able to teleport her bullets. While the bullet is being teleported, its velocity and deadliness is drastically decreased, turning it into a 6 range 4 damage Basic Attack."
talent,Lavenza,Hackerwoman,,0,Lavenza has an advantage when attempting to hack/manipulate relatively simple technology. A +3 for more advanced technology.
passive,Lavenza,Patch Notes,,0,"As a main action on her turn, Lavenza can pull up her laptop and pump out some new “balance changes'' for her current robot. These changes take the form of slight changes to her robot’s kit, either via numbers or added effects, or extra rules/conditions added into a robot’s coding when it is put into A.I. Mode. Depending on the severity of the changes, Lavenza pays variable stamina cost. Any given “Build” of a robot can have up to 6 changes from base, and at the start of combat, Lavenza can choose to either utilize a previously completed build or to continue adjusting an incomplete build during the combat. She cannot change the build she is using mid combat, but she can revert previously made changes on a build to free up her augment slots. At the end of a session, Lavenza can choose one build to bring to her next session."
ability,Lavenza,Mini-Gadgets,X,0,"As an inventor, Lavenza always has a wealth of contraptions at her disposal. Of course, she has also outfitted her robots with a teleportation device that allows her to send them these contraptions on the fly. Stamina cost and usage of the contraption depends on what exactly it is, and the device typically has to be on the smaller side. Using this ability takes both Lavenza’s Main Action and her robot’s Movement Action. (Prof 15) U-Turn - Whirlagigas can now send things to Lavenza if Lavenza would so desire with no extra stamina cost using Mini-Gadgets. This allows Lavenza to use items found in the combat if she so desires to make more unique and effective gadgets."
ability,Lavenza,Max Difficulty CPU,3,0,"When Lavenza is feeling particularly lazy, or she wants to see how her coding is shaping up, she puts her current robot into its autopilot “A.I. Mode”. When doing so, she gives the robot a singular command, prompting it to do nothing but that until the goal is achieved. When in this mode, the robot will destroy absolutely everything via the use of whatever it has in its kit, which gains a +2 in damage, or simple grab-n-throws on units and objects in its path. The GM controls all of the robot’s turns (including rolling for the robot unless they’d rather Lavenza’s Player do so), while a miniature drone with a Holo-Caster is deposited at the site of activation. This drone has 5 movement, 10 stamina, and allows Lavenza to use Mini-Gadgets (using only its main action) from it. Considering its size, however, the drone cannot operate non-automatic gadgets on its own. If the drone is destroyed, Lavenza cannot do anything until the assigned goal is either completed or cancelled via use of a full turn. Maintaining A.I. Mode has a 1 stamina upkeep cost on the robot. The initial activation of this ability requires use of Lavenza’s and her robot’s main action, unless Lavenza rolls a 15+, which frees up her robot’s main action. (Prof 24) My A.I. Can Produce Mind Boggling Effects - While giving the A.I. a task to do, Lavenza can give a new passive/talent/ability based on a CPU from one of the many video games that she has played. This Passive/Talent/Ability can only be used by a robot while in the Max Difficulty CPU state."
ability,Lavenza,Mini-BAMFs,X,0,"Lavenza has been sending one of her most… competent inventions to DBA recently. That invention being B.A.M.F. the friendly bomb! Lavenza, not really knowing the ultimate fruit of her endeavors, wants to see B.A.M.F. himself in action. Thus, Lavenza can send over X mini-B.A.M.F.s (Max of 5). Each having a stamina point for every 5 stamina points that B.A.M.F. has. However, since there are so many mini-B.A.M.F.s, that's too many games of minesweeper to be played by one person alone. Lavenza’s Player can choose to give off the other games of minesweeper to other people. The catch is though, Lavenza's Player has to be playing for at least one of the mini-B.A.M.F.s. Normally, B.A.M.F. just gets a buff if a game is completed, however, Mini-B.A.M.F.S. get to take their main action if a game of minesweeper is completed by the player that took said Mini-B.A.M.F.. If a Mini-B.A.M.F. would crit, Proficiency goes into the actual B.A.M.F.!"
weapon,Whirlagigas,Heavy Smash,,1,"Whirlagigas launches a devastating punch at a chosen target, utilizing its size to dominate space. However, its large amount of startup causes it to have a -3 to its rolls. However, this comes with the plus of anytimes needing to roll at least 3 higher than Whirlagigas’s natural roll in order to stop this attack. 7 damage 2 range."
weapon,Whirlagigas,Eye Lasers,,0,"Whirlagigas’s eyes shine bright before launching a barrage of pinpoint laser beams. The laser fires in a line across the battlefield, dealing 1 damage to the first person it hits. 1 damage 20 range."
talent,Whirlagigas,Ün Ün Ün,,0,Whirlagigas is a 2x2 monster of a unit that can travel through enemy units and smaller obstacles as if it is unobstructed.
talent,Whirlagigas,Wall Bounce,,0,"When Whirlagigas throws/knocks a unit into a wall or similar surface, if Lavenza desires, they bounce off of said wall/surface with great force. This allows the first follow-up attack performed on said unit during this turn to roll with advantage. If a unit can reasonably manage to attack this unit after the Wall Bounce and the turn the Wall Bounce occurred and before that unit would naturally fall to the ground, they receive the advantage. A Wall Bounce can only occur Once per Round."
talent,Whirlagigas,Armor Junkie,,0,"If Whirlagigas ever gains/receives DR (not from its own kit), the first hit it takes while it has said DR automatically grants Whirlagigas a charge of its Passive."
passive,Whirlagigas,Omni-Armor,,1,"Whirlagigas is incredibly sturdy and bulky, allowing it to use its overwhelming strength to power through the toughest of obstacles. No amount of force or damage can stop Whirlagigas while it performs an action, as it simply brute forces its way through to continue. Whenever it does so, the Kinetic Force of the damage is absorbed into Whirlagigas, being stored in one of the three generators on its back. Along with this, Once per Round, Whirlagigas may attempt to armor through an attack targeting it. Doing so may reduce the damage slightly, but primarily, it negates all knockback and prevents Whirlagigas from being knocked prone while also allowing it to store the Kinetic Force. While Whirlagigas has Kinetic Force stored, it may pay variable amounts of stamina along with expending said instance of Kinetic Force to perform one of multiple options: - By paying 1 stamina as an anytime, Whirlagigas may attempt to cause its entire body to vibrate, producing a shockwave to stop and/or negate the damage from an incoming attack.  - By paying 3 stamina as a Bonus Action on its turn, Whirlagigas can “cancel” out of an action it is performing, rolling and moving up to 2 spaces if Lavenza desires. After doing so, it can perform one from this set of actions (that may receive some form of damage proration depending on the situation/length of a given action chain Whirlagigas is in the middle of): - Hardcore Headbutt - Whirlagigas grasps onto an adjacent unit before slamming its head into them with great force. This deals 6-7 damage that removes DR on a unit that it hits while knocking them prone. - Lethal Lariat - Whirlagigas extends its arms outward, spinning like a top to hit all units adjacent to it for 5 damage. This attack inflicts up to 3 spaces of knockback on hit units, and the whirlwind of force Whirlagigas produces creates a small forcefield around it that gives it 1 DR for the next attack it is hit by. - Deadly Drag - Whirlagigas grabs an adjacent unit before slamming them into the ground and dragging them across it up to 3 spaces away from Whirlagigas’s current location. This deals 6 damage to the grabbed unit, and 2-3 to all enemies Whirlagigas passes through. At the end of this attack, the initial target is thrown into the air."
ability,Whirlagigas,Hell Cyclone,3,0,"Whirring to life in an instant, Whirlagigas reaches out and grabs an adjacent unit, placing them in a grapple. From here, Whirlagigas either performs some kind of massively showy suplex maneuver on them, or begins wildly slamming them into the ground and/or nearby objects. This typically deals around 8-10 damage on a target, but this may change depending on the type of technique that is utilized.  Regardless of this, Whirlagigas can choose to end this attack with a vicious hammer toss, spinning rapidly before throwing its target up to 6 spaces away. This turns them into a projectile, causing them to deal 1-4 damage to units they pass through."
ability,Whirlagigas,Shoulder Check,1+X!,1,"Once per Round. With surprising speed and great force, Whirlagigas dashes forward up to its movement speed while performing a deadly shoulder bash. This deals 2-4 damage, and interrupts the actions of those Whirlagigas collides with during the attack. However, upon the initial activation of the ability, Whirlagigas can elect to hold its charge, causing them to wait until a specified turn (any point within said turn) to dash. For each full turn that it is held, the attack gains specific additional properties, and Whirlagigas must pay an additional point of stamina. This can be held up to 4 turns, having to be released by the end of the fourth turn, and Whirlagigas can choose to cancel the charge at any point during it, moving a space in any direction while doing so. 1 Turn Charge - This attack knocks hit units prone. +1 damage. 2 Turn Charge - This attack causes a hit unit to spin-out before being knocked prone, giving this attack up to 6 spaces of knockback (Lavenza may decide how far she wants to send someone). Along with this, the next instance of damage they receive is increased by 1. +2 damage. 3 Turn Charge - This attack causes a hit unit to go flying into the air, knocking them up to 6 spaces in any direction (Lavenza may decide how far she wants to send someone), before they fall back to the ground prone. This allows Whirlagigas, to, if Lavenza wants, move up to a hit unit to follow-up with a main action, although at reduced effectiveness. +3 damage. (Prof 13) Rocket Cancel - While/after performing Shoulder Check, Whirlagigas can spend 1 stamina to have the jet engines built into its back and/or limbs activate, causing it to move half of its movement speed in any direction. This dash doesn’t deal damage inherently, but may lead to extra damage depending on circumstance."
ability,Whirlagigas,Terror Twister,3,0,"Whirlagigas’s upper body begins spinning rapidly, to the point that a mini-twister begins forming around them. Whirlagigas can move up to 2 spaces, dealing 4 damage to any units it is/becomes adjacent to while also knocking them back slightly. Along with this, green, whirling winds begin spiraling around hit units, inflicting them with the “Twisted” status. Units afflicted with Twisted must use 2 movement to move a single space away from Whirlagigas and, if they have not used their Movement Action to move on their turns, they are dragged 2-3 spaces closer to Whirlagigas. If a unit is dragged closer to Whirlagigas in this way while already adjacent to it, they take 1 damage. If a unit afflicted with Twisted suffers decent knockback that forces them away from Whirlagigas, they may take additional damage as wind force tears at them"
weapon,Melograno,Knives Upon Knives,,0,"Melograno always has what seems like an infinite amount of knives hidden within his clothes. One alone is nasty, but even if it’s knocked away, Melograno can just pull another one out to stab ya! (Prof 25) I’ll Cut You Up Real Good! - Damage of Melograno’s basic weapon is increased from 5 to 6. (Prof 46) I MEAN IT I REALLY WILL! - Damage of Melograno’s basic weapon is increased from 6 to 7. (Prof 55) Pocket Knives - By flicking his head or any other limb, knives hidden throughout Melograno’s wardrobe fly out towards enemies! This has a range of 5 + his basic weapon’s range, and 1 damage."
weapon,Melograno,Sphynx,,0,"A Legendary Blade in the form of a small, golden dagger. Can transform into a bag that, when items are put inside of it, grants properties to the blade based on the bag's contents. (5 Prof into it) [RIDBI’S KILLING BLOW] Woodcarving Guide Book for Blades - For some odd reason, this book and its Epithetical power resonates strongly with Sphynx. This may allow it to produce special “woodcarving effects”, and/or generally be much more proficient at woodcarving itself."
talent,Melograno,Phone A Friend,,0,"So long as Melograno has seen someone and memorized what they look like, he is able to link up and start a call between the two of them regardless of if Melograno can see them or not. Of course, they can respond to his messages, or not pick up if they’re a dick."
talent,Melograno,Hang Up,,0,"Sometimes you can’t just deal with this same shit over and over. You get an automatic roll to cancel anytimes negatively targeting you, as long as they’ve hit you successfully previously."
talent,Melograno,"So Nice, They Did It Twice",,1,"Upon landing an attack with a 15+ for the roll, Melograno may immediately take another action! This uses the natural roll for all rolls except the first that triggers this each round."
passive,Melograno,Punchin' In The Numbers,,2,"At the start of combat, Melograno can...wait, is that a phone ringing? Yes, in fact it’s Melograno’s! As he checks to see the number that’s calling him, he rolls 10 d10s to determine each digit. With this now created phone number, Melograno is able to take any one of the digits and add it to or subtract it from a chosen numerical value or roll as a once per round anytime action. Any zeroes rolled add one extra stamina to Melograno’s maximum for the combat. (Prof 20) Area Code - Since old phone plans need you to type a 1 before the area code and number, you get a 1 from your passive in addition to the 10 other numbers that are added. (Prof 39) Chain Phone Calls - Whenever Melograno successfully lands a basic attack, uses Yellow Pages, or BRRRRRING RING RING RING, Melograno gets to roll another d10 for Punchng In The Numbers. (Prof 60) Punchin’ in the Letters - An upgrade to Punching In The Numbers. Melograno’s flip phone has been upgraded into one of those keyboard phones! Whenever Melograno rolls a 1d10 for his passive, Melograno may designate any number of those dice to be for letter types instead of numbers. He rolls a 1d26 for each one he does so to, corresponding to a letter in the English alphabet. Taking up the same “once per round” anytime slots as when you apply numbers, Melograno can apply these letters to objects or properties of items to alter their effects! He can apply as many letters as he has at once in a single anytime use as well, to modify something on a greater scale if he has the resources for it. Letters are potentially very powerful but are more specialized in their use than numbers, so choose wisely! (Prof 81) Address Book - Whenever Melograno’s passive triggers at the start of combat for the first time this session, if he doesn’t like his number/letter distribution, he can choose to save his first list of 10 and instead roll a second set. The “stored” set can then be used to replace any other set you roll for the rest of the session. You can only have one stored set at a time.(Prof 91) Family Plan - 0s rolled by Punchin' in the Numbers grant +1 overheal stamina to each of his allies as well as himself."
passive,Melograno,Instant Transmission,,2,Melograno can choose one of his non anytime abilities at the start of combat. It can be used as a Bonus Action on his turn.
ability,Melograno,Yellow Pages,2,1,"Aw, Melograno knew he knew the number for this place at some point, but it looks like he forgot it. Fortunately, he has a phone book that he can use to relocate it! By stating who or what he’s calling, he can summon an object related to them so long as he gives context/reason as to why he could get that from them. [ROBIN] Oz’s Essence: Ancient Tome of Knowledge - Instead of the usual phone book, Melograno can pay 1 additional stamina and manifest a book containing an account of history and knowledge from across the ages. This allows Melograno to pull from specific historical events and figures when using Yellow Pages. This can even allow him to summon ghostly reconstructions of these figures to perform an action before dissipating."
ability,Melograno,Number Neighbor,2,1,"Spends Melograno’s Main Action and Movement. He moves forward like a normal movement action, but he suddenly leaves behind an untransformed clone of himself. Both copies have half total and current stamina -2 before performing this move, and both spend the stamina cost afterwards."
ability,Melograno,BRRRRRING RING RING RING,2,0,"Melograno whips out his phone and starts calling a person or an object that he is able to see. They cannot ignore it, and his message gets projected through their mind if they’re a person. Specifically, the message is a command of up to three words, and the listener obeys the command/is inflicted with an effect based off of what was said. (Prof 35) Saving Minutes - Melograno rolls advantage on BRRRRRING RING RING RING if giving a single word command."
ability,Melograno,Land Line,1!,1,"Melograno uses a cellphone, but that doesn’t mean he can’t get some phone wires using his epithet! With this, Melograno quickly conjures up a spiral cord with which to lasso something or tie up someone. Once he’s done doing whatever with it he can either dispel the cords or attach them to the ground to tether the thing in place. (Prof 43) Tangled Cords - Land Line can tether to other objects instead of just the ground."
ability,Melograno,Seven Days,3⛯,0,"Once per Combat Melograno, as if like clockwork, gets a call from a mysterious person or thing. Maybe it’s a cranky family member, usually it’s demons or ghosts or doctors or some other cursed shit. This surprise call causes their power to unleash in a 5 range forwards 3 range diameter cone in front of Melograno, as their pure rage flies through the phone speakers loud enough for it to be awkwardly listenable by passersby even without speaker mode. This applies a single effect related to the person calling on everyone within the area, before Melograno reblocks their number. Too bad his phone is too old to block numbers. If this ability is the target of Instant Transmission, it becomes a twice per combat."
ability,Melograno,Linked With Multiple Devices,3,2,"Melograno transmits an ethereal cord of data from his phone over to another ally within his line of sight. Once the connection has been established, so long as they’re both on the same plane of existence, they are aware of each other’s locations and, more importantly, they gain access to each other’s abilities. This tether has no limit to how long it can last, but only one tether can exist at a time. If made a bonus action with Instant Transmission, you can have up to two tethers instead creating a 3-way share for just that combat."
ability,Melograno,Emergency Hotline,3⛯,0,"An app that has quick access to a large variety of different, direct phone numbers for when you’re in dire straits! All categorized so that it’s quick to get to what you need.When used as an ability, a pink aura erupts from a target within 10 spaces of Melograno, which remains wavering and shining until combat ends or Melograno cuts the connection. For as long as this is active, Melograno can use a once per round anytime to instantly teleport the affected unit to a space adjacent to him, allowing them to completely avoid the negative effects of something they were targeted by. Even if, for example, this is used to have the affected unit dodge an AoE that they would still be hit by even after teleporting, they still avoid the effects, simply remaining in teleport stasis for just long enough to remain safe. While this ability is active, Melograno cannot use any other App Abilities, and also loses access to Instant Transmission. In the case of Number Neighbor Clones, none of them can use the App Abilities, but only the one who activated Emergency Hotline loses access to Instant Transmission."
weapon,Roko,Rock Hard Pummel,,0,"Roko coats chosen parts of her body in stone before slamming into an enemy unit. Upon making contact with another surface, Roko can choose for the stone to extend from her body onto said surface, which may have various effects. On rolls of 16+, this inflicts 1d3 stacks of Petrify. 5 damage 1 range. (Prof 21) Hard Coating - +1 Damage (5 to 6)."
weapon,Roko,Bringer,,1,"Roko’s Golden Artifact, a weapon granted to her via her connection to her father. To activate Bringer, along with the mantra typically stated with Golden Artifacts, Roko must also either plant or crush a small golden seed that she manifests. Depending on what she does, the form Bringer takes changes. This initial activation can be used as Movement Action, and is what uses the above stats, as Roko can spit the seed as a projectile which nests itself in a unit or object of Roko’s choice. 1 damage 6 range. - Bringer - Cultivation (X Damage, X Range) - This is the form Bringer takes if Roko plants the seed within something. As she does, a storm of vines and flowers erupt from the seed, which can wrap and move however Roko wishes. If Roko targets an empty space, a 3x3, golden tree grows instead (which Roko can also manipulate). Along with this, Roko manifests an illustrious, golden weapon based on whatever the seed is growing in. This determines its stats and other abilities it can (and usually does) have. - Bringer - Order (5 Damage, 3 Range) - If Roko crushes the seed herself, from it, a golden, dual-bladed scythe with shimmering flowers blooming throughout the handle manifests, radiating life-like energy. It has Cleave inherently, and can be thrown past its melee range, taking up 2x2 area but losing 1 damage for each extra space traveled. When swung, Bringer causes plantlife to grow on spaces that it travels across, which Roko can manipulate and move freely. Along with this, when a unit is either standing on/in or is covered in this plantlife, Roko gains minor lifesteal (up to half damage max) when attacking them."
talent,Roko,Xanthic Eyes,,0,"At the start of combat, Roko attunes her epithet to a single enemy. Secretly list three different actions that enemy can perform. These actions cannot be something that takes only game mechanics into account, such as “use an anytime” or “use a once per combat”. Instead, they should be more specific, such as “hit Unit A with your sword” or “breathe fire on multiple targets”. Whenever the enemy takes one of those actions for the first time, that action gains a plus (value of which said enemy can choose) to their roll(s) and they take damage equal to that roll buff. Once they've done all three listed actions, they gain Petrify Stacks equal to 1/3rd their max stamina rounded up."
passive,Roko,Den Hazard,,1,"On Roko’s turns, she has up to three “Hazard Actions” that she can use to place specific areas on the field. The size of this area is a “X”x”X”, with “X” being equal to the amount of stamina she spends to create the area. The cap she can spend on a Hazard Action is 5 stamina. Upon creating a “Hazard Area”, a floating, yellow eye peers down onto it, crackling as it stays afloat. Whenever an enemy enters a Hazard Area, Roko can choose to activate the area, which does 1 of 2 things: She can choose to inflict stacks of Petrify equal to “X” + 1 onto the enemy. This does not cost stamina, nor does it remove the area. She can choose to expend the area, dealing damage equal to “X” + 1 and temporarily turning the enemy to stone. At this point, Roko can choose to leave them be, which negates their next movement action as they revert to normal, or, if she’s adjacent to the enemy or area, she can immediately follow-up with an extra action. This extra action is typically reduced in power. Expending the area costs 1 stamina, and the area dissipates regardless of whether Roko succeeds or not. An enemy only counts as “entering” a Hazard Area the first time they do within the span of 3 turns. (Prof 24) Radiation Warning - When Roko creates a Hazard Area, the dimensions of it can be whatever she wants, and X is now equal to the total number of spaces the area takes up multiplied by itself. For example, spending 1 Stamina gives her 1x1=1 space. 5 Stamina equals 5x5=25 total spaces. The areas do not have to be connected to each other. The spaces do not have to be connected to each other and can overlap. The cap she can spend on Hazard Areas is now increased from 3 to 5 Stamina."
passive,Roko,Trophy Unlocked,,1,"At the start of one combat per session, Roko can spend 5 Stamina to manifest a statuette copy of either one of the party members, or of someone very close to her whose form she’d had time to memorize. Good friends, family members, or significant others would be examples. This statuette has 25 Stamina and 2 DR against physical damage (minimum of 1 damage taken). If this statue is broken, the real version of that character is summoned to the statue’s location and can immediately take a Main Action that cannot combo or chain. This action rolls with advantage if used as a dual-tech with Roko or one of her allies. Roko can also give the statuette very small, minor changes that last for the duration of the Main Action. The statue can also be in any position she wants, and wearing whatever clothes she wants, so Roko can just create clothing now. Note that the summoned target, if summoned from outside the main party, is not dismissed after the action is taken, but they are heavily exhausted after being summoned in this manner, and after taking the Main Action cannot further participate in combat until after this session. She cannot summon targets who are in plot prison."
passive,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Animal Hybrid: Crimson Demon,,0,"This fruit is one of a handful that grants their user the ability to completely or partially turn into an animal/different species which grants a few benefits. It requires a Movement Action to go up or down a level. Hybrid - Roko’s body becomes cambian in nature, her skin turning a pinkish red and horns sprouting from your body. This gives her resistance to fire damage. Full - Roko’s body fully becomes a demon of the Crimson Hell. She becomes immune to fire damage, and fire attacks of this fruit now treat non-demonic fire immunity as a resistance and non-demonic fire resistance as if it weren’t there. She also sprouts wings and gains a fly speed. However, in return, she is now vulnerable to holy damage. VIP Access - Roko can transform into Hybrid Form at the start of combat if she desires."
passive,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Blood Cast,,1,"Roko may make an adjacent unit pay up to 3 stamina of any of her ability stamina costs, assuming the unit has blood."
ability,Roko,Stone Cold,X,0,"After firming her stance for a moment, Roko coats her entire body in stone. Once this has been done, she lashes out at an adjacent target, sending an immense amount of force into them. This deals variable damage depending on stamina spent, and the stamina spent also equates to how much knockback + 1 the blow will inflict on the target. Roko can also funnel any remaining movement she has into the knockback of the attack at a 1 to 1 ratio, which does not affect damage. (Prof 30) Rock Solid - If the roll for ‘Stone Cold’ fails, Roko still manages to reinforce her body according to the Stamina she spent, but does not manage to land an attack using it on this turn. However, on a future turn, ‘Stone Cold’ can be used as a Bonus Action for which she must pay 2 Stamina if she uses the same damage value she would have had with the previous use. In addition, if she uses Stone Cold and the roll succeeds, she can still choose to have the attack not go off immediately and use the same Bonus Action rule described above, and until she uses Stone Cold again, the damage and knockback of ‘Rock Hard Pummel’ is increased by X divided by 2, rounded down. This lasts for 2 rounds at most and cannot be done twice in the same combat."
ability,Roko,Statuette Silencer,2!,1,"Roko, a gleam in her eyes, quickly dodges out of the way of an incoming attack to a space within 4 of her current location. Where she once stood is a statue of the attacker in a pose of Roko’s choice. If someone (other than Roko) makes contact with the statue, the part of their body that touched it becomes stuck in stone, restricting them in some way. A statue made with this ability lasts for one whole round. If an enemy makes contact with a statue after the turn it was created, they gain Petrify Stacks equal to however much damage they took with a minimum of 1. Once per Round. (Prof 35) Silenced - Statuette Silencer now inflicts Petrify Stacks equal to the damage it deals even if it’s touched the same turn it’s created, and Roko can now dodge up to 4 (increased from 2) spaces away"
ability,Roko,Eye of The Beholder,X,0,"Roko takes something she can see, and then constructs a stone copy of it that may differ in size to the original. If necessary to lift an object, she can enhance her physical strength by turning parts of her body to stone. If multiple objects are connected to each other, she can include any of them in the replica, but of course with higher stamina costs present. If this is used on an enemy, she can spend 1 additional stamina to inflict that many Petrify Stacks -1 onto a target."
ability,Roko,Serpentine Soldiers,3,1,"Sound the trumpets, for the angels of death approach. Roko focuses her power and creates two stone constructs within 3 spaces of her, each with the appearance of an eyeless stone serpent with wide, feathered wings. Each serpent has 10 Stamina and 2 DR against physical damage (minimum of 1 damage taken). By default, these serpents can’t move or act, but when they are summoned, Roko can choose enemies on the battlefield for each serpent to ‘attune’ to. Multiple serpents can attune to the same enemy. If an enemy that a serpent is attuned to is defeated, that serpent crumbles to dust. Each time an attuned enemy takes an action that is not directed specifically at a serpent they are attuned to, including moving in directions that are not directly towards the serpent, then it can move X spaces closer to them, where X equals 2 + half of the attuned target’s current Petrify stacks (rounded down), with X having a maximum of 6. The serpents can fly if necessary. If an enemy attempts to take an action that is not directed at an attuned serpent while it is adjacent to them, or attempt to move away from it, the serpent can roll with advantage to attack them, dealing 5 damage and inflicting 1d4+1 Petrify stacks. If Roko uses this ability again while serpents are still alive, the old ones are destroyed. Twice per Combat."
ability,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Devil Flame,1,0,"Roko creates demonic flame in her hands. This ability’s potency changes depending on her form: Base - This ability deals 3-5 fire damage to an adjacent unit, and can be used as a Bonus Action. Hybrid - This ability deals 5-6 fire damage at 3 range, and can be used as a Bonus Action. Full - This ability deals 6-8 fire damage in a 3x5 area adjacent to Roko and costs +1 stamina. VIP Access - +2 damage to all of Devil Flame’s variations. This is already accounted for in the ability text."
ability,Aku Aku No Mi Model Crimson Demon,Arch Fiend,3,0,"Hybrid and Full Form only. Roko summons 2d4! imps. They are weak-willed and will naturally follow her command, unless some arch devil of a higher rank than her is present (for example a member of the royal family)."
weapon,Sho,MEGA COOL MARTIAL ARTS ATTACK,,0,"Sho’s master has shown him enough martial arts movies to make sure that he knows how to do this right. 2 damage 1 range. (Prof 13) Barrage of Blows - Sho may willingly split up the amount of attacks using his MEGA COOL MARTIAL ARTS ATTACK he will make on his turn up to three, evenly dividing the damage by the amount of attacks he chooses to make. This cannot be used in Combination with Combo Time. (Prof 31) Striking Afterimage Technique - As long as Sho is splitting it up with ""Barrage of Blows"", he can continue moving after making a basic attack and then attack again after repositioning."
weapon,Sho,Sword Lessons - Spirit Sword,,0,"7 damage 1 range. Having done some training with Mr. Donovan, Sho has focused and refined the energy constructs he can make with Tic-Tac-Toe to Toe so that he can create a sword of pure energy whenever he would need it! As a Free Action, Sho can manifest this sword for 2 Stamina or 1 Stack (his choice), and he must pay 1 Upkeep if he keeps it manifested. It acts as a Basic Attack which ignores DR and adds half of Sho’s Stacks to damage. If Sho were to obtain a real sword, he can use this to instead enhance the sword, or choose to effectively dual-wield. Rolling a natural 20 with this Basic Attack grants Proficiency."
talent,Sho,Limit Break,,0,"Upon being put to half or less max stamina, Sho surpasses his current capacity. This gives him one action to take immediately and increases his passive charge interval to 2. With Limit Break active, Sho’s passive now procs when he doesn’t take a movement action, and he can double move to charge twice in one turn. (Prof 41) Limiter Removal - The first time Sho would trigger Limit Break in a session, he can choose to activate this instead.He still gets his immediate main action, but the other effects are instead: for the remainder of the session, Sho gains 1d2 charges whenever he would gain just 1 charge. Using this (obviously) causes him to be incapable of using Limit Break for the remainder of the session."
talent,Sho,Bento Box,,0,"As a child, Sho needs a lot of calories to ensure he grows healthy and strong, so he always makes sure his guardians pack him a lunchbox (or sixteen) before he goes out for the day. Once per Combat he may pull out one such box of food and consume its contents as a free action to heal for 4 stamina and recover from one status effect of his choice."
passive,Sho,Raising Tension,,0,"It takes a while for Sho’s epithet to reach peak operative capacity; the longer combat is the more effective he becomes. Every round he doesn’t take a Main Action, his movement speed and basic attack damage are increased by one. (Prof 21) Raising Tension - Every third time Sho gains a charge through his passive, Sho gets a stacking +1 to rolls on his basic attack for the rest of combat."
passive,Sho,I'm A Gum-Gum Human!,,1,"Sho’s entire body has properties identical to rubber! The exact depths of what that means will be explored later as he gets more used to it, develops new techniques, and/or takes more inspiration from the character who inspired the idea to do this to himself in the first place. But in any case, what matters for now is that Sho is highly resistant to bludgeoning force and electrical currents, having a flat 20 Physical DR against both. This effectively makes him immune to fall damage and many other similar things. Another important note is that it means he can stretch his body now! Sho’s melee reach is extended to 3 spaces as part of any action, but may be extended to 5 if he spends 1 Stamina on the action. This also applies to any ability that requires his arms or legs/physical body acting to accomplish."
ability,Sho,KaioKenshiro,1,0,"A form change where Sho increases his muscle mass dramatically in a short period of time without proper build up. This increases his passive counter by 4, with an upkeep of 1 stamina at the start of Sho’s turns. When he drops upkeep, his stacks are reduced by 2, along with the 4 temp stacks being removed."
ability,Sho,Lend Me Your Energy ,0!,1,"Whenever Sho would be damaged by an opponent, he can take on some of the power they used to hurt him, increasing his stacks by 1d3 and lowering the damage by that much (to a minimum of one). Once per Round. (Prof 25) Take My Energy! - Sho may use Lend Me Your Energy as a separate usage per round counter to reduce his power and heal another target of his choice with the d3."
ability,Sho,Combo Time,4⛯,1,"It’s time for the multiple hit chain that will knock out the big enemy. Roll 1dstack size+1 and start a combo attack where Sho rolls to hit an adjacent unit, knocks them two squares in a chosen direction, then follows up with another roll to hit. This continues until he misses or reaches the number of hits he rolled as maximum. Once per Combat."
ability,Sho,Tic-Tac-Toe to Toe,3,0,"Sho has realized he needs to diversify his skillset and think about some next level strategies and has thusly developed this technique which allows him to take his energy and form it into an effect based on which ‘shape’ he turns it into. - Xs - Sho focuses the energy in his body around his arms, forming serrated blades and then crosses them before making a chopping motion, creating an X marked cross-slash in the target. This attack does Sho’s basic attack damage and inflicts a bleed stack. Due to the cutting nature of this attack, he may ignore half of any DR a character has when using this. - Os - Forming it into a small sphere, Sho’s energy becomes a volatile projectile that can be fired up to 8 spaces for half of his basic attack damage, rounding down."
ability,Sho,Clashing Wills,2!,1,"Sho loves to fight people but the problem is that in most times that someone is fighting it is due to a clash in ideals and goals, with combat being the only way to determine whose philosophies are those worth making it through in the end. At least that's what he's gathered, he doesn't have a lot of ideals yet but it's what the bad guys always drone on about. Anyway, fighting with ideals is really cool! If Sho's attack would be countered with an anytime action, or if for whatever reason Sho and an enemy are attacking simultaneously, Sho can attempt to initiate an escalation. If the roll for the actions that allow him to use this are the same number, this happens without an activation roll. If the escalation rolls are within 1 of each other, they still escalate. For each escalation, the effective result of the action is strengthened starting at normal then 1.5, then doubled, then tripled, then quintupled as the max level effect, with the loser's being negated entirely. If Sho or the other affected target win the clash, they can choose to continue the escalation to increase the modifier this ability causes, and their next roll in the escalation gains a +2 roll buff. Once per Round."
ability,Sho,I’ll Fight With Both Hands Tied Behind My Back!,X,0,"Sho likes making sure that a fight that he’s in has proper stakes and challenges to overcome, otherwise what’s the point? He may choose to add any condition to any part of his current sheet and assign a stamina value to it. The Stronger the condition and more stamina spent the stronger it becomes while following your current guidelines. If you break a rule for whatever reason, regardless of your intent, you take double the spent stamina as irreducible damage. You can only have one Restriction active at a time. Bonus Action."
ability,Sho,Getsuga Ten-Sho,5⛯,0,"“Mr. Donovan’s sword Hades is really really cool! It can make these like really dangerous black flames n’ stuff! It might not be as cool since I don't have a weird demon dragon thingie stored inside me (I don’t think I do anyways), but I can make fire like it can if I try hard enough!”. Sho focuses an incredible amount of energy into his sword and then performs a massive energy slash with it. This affects a 3x6 area for his sword’s current damage and coats the area in black flames constructed from aura. This does not apply a burn status like Mr. Donovan’s technique, but the fires do stay within the targeted area. The terrain deals 3 irreducible damage for each space someone would move through it, and also at the start of their turns if a unit is in the area. Can only be used if Sho has his Spirit Sword manifested. Once per Combat."
ability,Sho,Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack,XX,1,"By focusing his usual rather volatile energy, Sho can exhale X amount of pseudo-clones of himself made of raw energy. As soon as they would make contact with anything, they detonate for 2d2 irreducible damage. These clones only have a Move Action, and have no Passives, Talents, or Abilities. However, their movement is equal to the movement speed Sho had when creating them. Half rounding down (minimum one) of these clones are allowed to take a move action upon being created. Recharge 5-6."
ability,Sho,Gum-Gum Fireworks,4,0,"Sho leaps into the air and wraps himself into a ball before sending out a bunch of punches and kicks in rapid succession. This deals his basic attack damage to everyone within a 10 foot radius of himself horizontally. This series of attacks is omnidirectional, meaning things such as a dodge will not work unless a unit fully gets out of the attack's range. Recharge 5-6."
weapon,Shotel,Execution Knife,,0,A small serrated knife used with great precision. It can be hidden without effort. 2 damage 1 range.
weapon,Shotel,King’s Club Katana,,0,"A katana obtained from within the armory of a fight club in Fight City. Nothing special in terms of craftsmanship, but effective enough to cut someone down. A tool is as effective as its wielder. 5 damage 1 range."
talent,Shotel,Two As One,,0,"Whenever Shotel attacks, Orthrus can take an immediate follow up action so long as the action affects the same target. If given to Orthrus, Shotel gets the follow up on Orthrus instead."
talent,Shotel,Putrid Sustain,,0,"Upon being knocked out, Shotel can continue to act even while unconscious until the end of her next turn. Be careful, as you can still die when going this far."
passive,Shotel,Biomantic Symbiote: Orthrus,,0,"Shotel has bound herself to a pact with a Peregrine Beast! Peregrine Beasts are special symbiotes which can form a lifelong connection with a person to grant them incredible powers! With Orthrus, you may pay any amount of max stamina and movement speed. If you do, Orthrus will morph itself into its own physical form, using Shotel’s very own flesh and organs to separate as a secondary creature. This does not require a roll, and you can do this multiple times to have multiple instances of Orthrus out. Orthrus has the same max stamina and movement speed that was paid to create it. You may also sacrifice any number of abilities, talents, or upgrades to also grant them to Orthrus, although doing so allows you to alter one part of its functionality for each thing. Orthrus isn’t considered a “summon” and is thus not susceptible to effects that target mooks or summons specifically. Regardless of what is given to it, Orthrus always has a basic attack where half its body morphs into a maw which deals 6 damage at melee range, or damage equal to a third of the stamina it’s missing from its max rounded down if that is more. Orthrus’s only weakness is that despite its offensive power, the terms of the pact mean that it can never knock out or take a life itself. The final blow must be done by Shotel herself, without using Orthrus’s powers. In addition, if Shotel is knocked out then Orthrus becomes dormant until she is resuscitated. All spent mechanics are returned to Shotel at the end of combat."
passive,Shotel,Head Hunter,,0,"Whenever Shotel lands the finishing blow on an enemy, she gains +1 max stamina. This is capped at +3 in a combat."
passive,Beri Beri No Mi,Bouncing Balls,,0,"Whenever Shotel would be exposed to bludgeoning damage, her body can split into multiple orbs reflexively to defend itself. This gives her a passive 5 DR against bludgeoning damage. If for whatever reason her body cannot split apart, this does not apply."
ability,Shotel,Divide Huntress,3,0,"Shotel runs forward as the top half of her body morphs into a beast-like maw. She travels in one direction up to her movement speed, passing through enemies along the way. Each enemy passed through takes 5 damage. If used by Orthrus, it may immediately take another action that isn’t Divide Huntress."
ability,Shotel,Spinal Tap,3!,1,"Shotel directly shocks either her own physical form or that of an adjacent organic creature. This causes a biomantic mutation to appear, granting a buff or debuff based on how their physicality is altered. This ability can only be used on enemies if they just failed an attack on Shotel. Alternatively, if this is used by Orthrus it can only be used on himself, but allows him to alter how any of his abilities function to a decent degree for the rest of combat. Once per Round."
ability,Shotel,Polyp Point,2,0,"Shotel rips off a part of her body and throws it up to 5 spaces away. If this makes direct contact, the projectile turns into boiling blood which deals 4 damage. If placed on the ground, the mass becomes a small filament on the ground. Once an enemy passes over it, the filament immediately extends into a 20 foot tall bone spear, which deals 7 damage and sticks the hit target in place so long as they’re a 2x2 or smaller. If used by Orthrus, he may perform this ability twice in one action, paying costs for both."
ability,Shotel,Blood Blade,4,0,"A large bleeding bone protrusion comes out of Shotel’s left arm, as she swipes upwards to create a 12 range piercing slice of blood that moves along the ground dealing 4 damage to everyone hit. When used by Orthrus it can fire out three of these waves in one action."
ability,Shotel,Kick His Teeth Out,2,0,"Shotel lifts her boot and kicks, moving 1 space forwards as she does so. Upon contact, the hit enemy takes 4 damage and is knocked back up to 6 spaces! However, if 12 damage will knock the enemy out it will deal that much instead. This factors in Go For The Kill as well. When used by Orthrus it loses the bonus knockout range but becomes a tackle, with Orthrus moving with the hit enemy alongside the attack and knocking them prone. It may immediately take another action that isn’t Kick His Teeth Out."
weapon,Silas,Knuckle Sandwich,,0,"A classic. Can’t beat it! Can beat them up, though. Eat this! 4 damage 1 range."
weapon,Silas,Batter Up,,0,"A mundane wooden baseball bat. Effective, but it sure is a normal ass bat. Might break if under enough stress. When Silas chooses a Partner, this weapon may potentially change into something else to match the Partner’s aesthetic. 5 damage 1 range."
talent,Silas,"Always a Bridesmaid, Never a Bride",,0,"Silas is always looking out for his friends, and his Epithet can ensure things go well for them (no matter the cost). Silas can transfer any effects or “conceptual things” that he currently has that could be considered positive or useful to his Partner. Conversely, his Partner can transfer any negative effects or conceptual things to Silas. These both share a Once per Round usage, which can be activated on either Silas’s or his Partner’s turns as a Free Action."
talent,Silas,Best Friends Forever!,,0,"Despite being an Epithet User, Silas gains the benefits of being a Synchronized Mundie! Similarly, if the GM feels that Silas and his Partner worked especially well together in a Combat/Scenario, the two of them can gain an additional Companionship compared to what would otherwise be given."
passive,Silas,Leave It To Me!,,1,"On its own, Silas’s Epithet isn’t able to flourish. Silas’s strengths lie in those around him that he can support with all of his will. It’s their time to shine. At the start of a combat/scenario, Silas is able to select a Partner from any of his party members. Upon doing so, his body and outfit may shift to match their aesthetic, as his Epithet attunes to them, their essence, and their capabilities. When rolling Initiative, the Partner essentially has Advantage, able to select either their rolled result or Silas’s. Silas can choose to have his turn occur immediately after his Partner’s if he so desires. When Dual Teching with his Partner, not only are his Partner’s capabilities bolstered and able to be stretched, but also, either he or his Partner roll with Advantage. Similarly, as a Once per Round, Unrolled Anytime, Silas can give up his next Main Action to grant his Partner Advantage on a roll. (Prof 8) Silas Will Now DIE For You - If Silas’s Partner would be knocked to or below 0 Stamina due to an incoming attack and/or effect, and they are within Silas’s Movement Speed, Silas can spring to action: diving into his partner, knocking them out of the way and taking the attack instead of them. This must be rolled for, but if Silas and his Partner have 5 or more Companionship with each other, it has Advantage. This counts as an Epithet Effect. Once per Combat. (Prof 15) On The Same Wavelength - Silas and his Partner can communicate telepathically!"
passive,Silas,The Support,,1,"When Silas would target a member of his “Team” with any action that specifies them as the target, he may choose before rolling to simply take 10 on his roll. If he does not take 10 on the roll, Silas may reroll a failed roll targeting an ally this round so long as it is not a critical failure, or have a critical failure resolve as a normal failure."
ability,Silas,Right Hand Man,1,0,"Silas turns to his Partner...The Partner can now wield Silas as a weapon. Like literally. Regardless of the Partner’s physical strength, they are able to grab/lift Silas, as his Epithet makes it so, to the Partner, Silas feels as light as a feather. Conversely, when hitting other units or objects, Silas becomes far more solid, making it so he doesn’t take recoil from normal swings. Upkeep 1. Inherently, Silas deals around 6-8 damage and has 1 range as a melee weapon. He can also be thrown. Depending on Silas’s Partner and how said Partner has caused Silas to change, Silas may gain extra properties as a weapon! Anything on the Partner’s kit that utilizes their Basic Weapon(s) can instead use Silas. Using Silas as a weapon counts as Dual Teching. (Prof 13) Weapon Bonding - Silas, when used as a weapon via Right Hand Man, gains +2 damage (4-6 to 6-8). Along with this, if he and his Partner have Companionship Upgrades, the “Silas Weapon” can/may gain additional properties based off of those Companionship Upgrades, regardless of if that specific upgrade relates to Right Hand Man."
ability,Silas,Color Commentary,1!,1,"As his Partner performs an action, Silas’s Epithet springs to life, putting him on the same wavelength so that he can understand what they’re going for. As this happens, Silas explains exactly what is happening, or at least what his Partner is going for, literally reading the action’s text in-universe. The only difference is that things mentioning statistics directly in “game mechanic speak” are instead heard as something that would make more sense for people actually living in this world. Doing this either grants the action a variable roll buff, or allows its effects to be bolstered, as Silas or his Partner explains why exactly they are doing what they are doing. This can add extra damage, inflict statuses, or other strange effects depending on the exact scenario. Once per Round."
ability,Silas,In Your Footsteps,X,0,"This ability changes into something entirely new depending on Silas’s Partner. Its restrictions are that: - It is scaled based off of Silas’s Proficiency - It is specifically to be used to either directly support, combo off of, or lead into the action of Silas’s Partner (oftentimes whichever would fit most with their gameplan) - It either somehow matches the Partner’s aesthetic(s) or is conversely a more mundane seeming technique that Silas could likely perform without an Epithet (although in this case it still counts as an Epithet effect) - If this created ability is used to support anyone other than Silas’s Partner, it rolls with Disadvantage (unless it somehow also directly impacts the Partner in some way) - This ability can also be used to do something based off of the Partner’s power(s)/aesthetic(s), but scaled to Silas’s Proficiency. In this case, X is typically decided by GM "
weapon,Taliesin,Truth's Saber,,0,"A holy sword, constructed of Taliesin’s Epithet, ready to slash through injustice. Deals 5 holy damage as a melee weapon, and can cleave, but doing so makes it only deal 3 damage. (Prof 19) Pursue Justice - Truth’s Saber’s crit range is increased to 19+, which is further increased to 17+ if Taliesin is within the areas created from either Guiding Light or Strike Them Down!."
weapon,Taliesin,Mighty Shield,,0,"Taliesin raises his Epithet-constructed shield, combining this attack with his movement to charge forward! Deals 3 damage to those rammed into, and the shield blocks incoming projectiles and potentially some physical attacks that would otherwise interrupt the attack."
talent,Taliesin,Quite The Crowd Pleaser,,0,"Taliesin, due to his status as both a superhero and a famous superhero actor means that quite a few people know who he is. As such, he is typically able to roll with advantage on any sort of charisma related checks, not restricted to persuasion, deception, or charming others."
passive,Taliesin,The Light Which Illuminates All,,1,"Taliesin’s Epithet, when fully activated, is what morphs his attire into his superhero garments. Similarly, it begins producing a 5ft radiant aura of light that Taliesin has active at all times. Not only does it automatically reveal enemies that are currently in stealth, but whenever Taliesin or one of his allies attacks an enemy within the aura, a “Hero Rank” is added onto either the attacker or the attacked (which is Taliesin’s choice). Spending Hero Ranks - Hero Ranks can then be spent as a once per turn anytime. If spent on an enemy, it deals damage equal to the number of spent Ranks +1. If spent on Taliesin or an ally, they can either be used to heal 1 stamina for each spent Rank - 1 (minimum of 1), or improve a roll by the number of spent Ranks +1. However, Hero Ranks are also able to be spent to level up the abilities of Taliesin or his allies. All of Taliesin’s abilities have specified level up effects, while his allies may take properties of one of Taliesin’s abilities and apply them to their own. True Justice - If Taliesin or an ally reach 7 or more Hero Ranks, they achieve “True Justice” Form. This boosts their damage and movement by their accumulated Hero Ranks divided by 2 (rounded up). Also, if they successfully damage an enemy with a roll higher than their current number of Hero Ranks (or a Nat 20), they can spend all of their Ranks to baton pass an action to a chosen ally. (Prof 16) Make a Lasting Impact - The spirit of heroism isn’t snuffed out so easily. At the end of combat, Taliesin can choose one member of his party to keep all Hero Ranks currently on them into the next combat. The person he chooses also gains 1 Rank at the start of the next combat, which they can place on themselves or an enemy of their choice."
ability,Taliesin,Guiding Light,3,0,"With an extended hand, Taliesin produces a 3x3 pillar of light onto the field. This deals 1 damage to any enemies inside, and conversely heals all allies for 1 stamina, while all inside immediately gain 2 Hero Ranks. This area is able to be directly influenced by Taliesin as a free action on his turn, allowing him to terraform it, produce effects, or other feats of will. If an ally performs an action while inside the area, Taliesin can pay the stamina cost of that action +1 to assist via the power of the area. Only one of these areas can be present on the field at the time. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. While a Guiding Light area is present on the battlefield, Taliesin can choose a member of his party to be “connected” to the area. This means that whenever the Guiding Light Area is terraformed/altered, a similar change can be applied to that team member. For example, creating a Ballista Tower in the area may give the member a light construct crossbow they can use to augment their actions in some way. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Whenever a unit starts their turn in a Guiding Light area, or is in one at the start of Taliesin’s turns, they gain 1 Hero Rank. This also grants 1 Hero Rank to the unit that is “connected” to the area, but only at the start of Taliesin’s turns. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. The effects granted from Level 3 now grant 2 Hero Ranks instead of one. Taliesin can now have multiple Guiding Light areas on the field at a time. (Prof 22) Keep on the Pressure - The area produced from Guiding Light not only counts as an aura for The Light Which Illuminates All (that does not stack with Taliesin’s base aura), but when an enemy inside of it is attacked, there is a 50% (1d2) chance that they are inflicted with the Link Strike Status. This status lasts until the top of the next round, and when an afflicted unit takes damage, the unit that inflicted this status rolls to immediately perform a basic attack on them regardless of range."
ability,Taliesin,Strike Them Down!,1,1,"With an outward stretch of his arm, Taliesin creates a sword made of light in midair. This sword can originate anywhere within 4 spaces of Taliesin as it zooms towards a space/unit of Taliesin’s choice also within 4 spaces of his current position, and if it hits a unit, Taliesin can choose for it to deal up to 4 damage. A hit unit loses buffs, debuffs, and/or status effects currently on them of Taliesin’s choice. However, if this strikes an empty space, the sword instead creates a 3x3 area with the effects of Taliesin’s Passive. Similarly, Taliesin can choose to have the origin point of any future uses of this ability be in this created area. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. Once this ability connects with an enemy target, a second light sword begins spiraling around them. In up to 4 turns (Taliesin’s choice of which turn), this sword shall activate, piercing into the target and exploding. This deals 1 damage, but inflicts decent knockback, and, if this is taking place on the affected unit’s turn, this will specifically activate during their action in an attempt to throw them off. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin is now able to have the swords created from this ability be varying types of swords. This may influence their damage, range, and other secondary properties. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. Upon hitting enemy targets, they are now surrounded by 3 light swords that function the same as the spiraling swords granted in Level 2. Along with this, Taliesin can elect to not have the spiral swords effect activate, and in doing so, allowing him to use this ability as a Bonus Action. (Prof 13) Spread Your Influence - Swords created from Strike Them Down! now remain on the field after being initially fired. If stuck in a unit, it produces a 5ft aura of light that functions the same as the aura from The Light Which Illuminates All that can stack with Taliesin’s own aura. If stuck on an otherwise empty space, it acts as a turret that Taliesin can fire further instances of the ability from without taking up his own main action. Only one sword can do this per turn."
ability,Taliesin,Hero Signal,2!,1,"Suddenly, a beam of light pierces the sky, showcasing an emblem representing Taliesin’s superhero persona! Not one to ignore a call to action, Taliesin immediately jumps over to the symbol’s position. If it is shining upon either an “evil” target or a current source of damage/attacking force, Taliesin can immediately perform an interrupting basic attack. The space the light shines upon must be within 6 spaces of Taliesin’s current position. Once per Round. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. Upon reaching his chosen destination via this ability, the cast spotlight reflects off of him, placing 1 Hero Rank on every enemy within 2 spaces of him. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Hero Signal no longer needs to target an evil target/current source of damage in order to perform the follow-up basic attack, and if Taliesin wants, he can choose to have the initial roll for this ability be used for said basic attack. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin’s blade shines with a radiant sheen as he zooms to his target. The range of this ability is increased by 1, and all enemies he passes by (adjacent) on his way to his target are struck for 4 damage as a sword slash manifests in the air. (Prof 28) Stay Vigilant - After attacking via Hero Signal, if there are any other enemies within 3 spaces of the first target, Taliesin can pay 1 stamina to immediately jump over to them and attack, a shining cone of light surrounding him like a sonic boom. These chain attacks deal additional damage to summons/mooks (including the initial target if Taliesin specified he was going to chain before he rolled for the action). If there are no other enemies in range (or if he simply elects to), Taliesin can instead pay 2 stamina to attack the initial target again (this type of chain can only occur up to twice). Once this chain is finished, Taliesin can move 2 spaces before the interaction is resolved. While chaining, the Level 4 effect of Hero Signal cannot hit the same unit twice in the same interaction."
ability,Taliesin,Reflect Radiance,2,0,"Taliesin produces a floating, yellow crystal on an empty space within 4 of his current location. These crystals can take in light produced from actions/people/objects within 3 spaces of it (which must be rolled for), and then Taliesin can pay 1 stamina to have the crystal reflect said light onto a space either back at the source or at another location within 2 of it as an anytime action (once per round per crystal). Anything this light strikes may be inflicted with an effect based on properties of the stored light that the crystal is using. If Taliesin is the one hit by this, beneficial effects gained from it are typically slightly better than when used on others. Bonus Action. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. When projecting effects using a crystal produced by Reflect Radiance, Taliesin is now able to fuse multiple “light sources” together to create an amalgamated effect out of all of them! This can either be a strange combination of effects from all light sources, or something brand new as a result of the fusion. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin no longer needs to roll to store light within a crystal produced by Reflect Radiance. He can choose to roll if wants, and if he succeeds the roll, 1d2 Hero Ranks are placed on the unit that is acting as the light source. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin can produce up to 2 crystals in a single usage of Reflect Radiance. Crystals can move up to 4 spaces on Taliesin’s turns. Light sources can be shared and/or fused between crystals."
ability,Taliesin,(Martial Technique) Mirror Image,X,1,"With a glowing outline illuminating his form as his aura glows even brighter, several images step out of Taliesin's space to mask his location. When this ability is used, he may create a number of mirror images up to his base movement speed by paying one stamina per image, which may move up to half of his movement speed away. Taliesin may also move up to half of his movement speed and, at any point on his turn as a once per round free action, he may swap locations with any of his images through trickery of the light and sheer speed. The images can not take any other action on Taliesin's turn other than moving at half speed, though while any of them are active it is incredibly difficult to discern which is the real Taliesin. This ability may be used as a Movement Action. Taliesin may only have a maximum number of images active at once equal to his base movement speed. - Level 2 - Achieved by allocating 1 Hero Rank to this ability. The images are now able to move up to their full speed, and upon swapping, Taliesin may choose to perform a minor follow-up action. - Level 3 - Achieved by allocating 3 Hero Ranks to this ability. Taliesin is now able to swap places with the images twice per round and have any of his actions/effects originate from their spaces by spending one of their once per round swaps, quickly swapping to their location, using the action/effect, and then swapping back. - Level 4 - Achieved by allocating 5 Hero Ranks to this ability. The images may now attempt to attack a target for half of Taliesin’s base basic attack damage rounded down, and share the effects of The Light Which Illuminates All, although they only gain half of the benefits Taliesin usually would. Only one of the images’ auras can stack with Taliesin’s own at a time."
weapon,Wight,Himawari,,0,"An ages-old katana that has miraculously been preserved in near peak state. It has the words “Stay true to yourself” engraved within the blade. With Wight’s mechanization, it has been attached in a groove in their right arm. 5 damage 1 range (Prof 7) Sharpened Blade - Himawari gains +1 damage (5 to 6)."
weapon,Wight,Revenant Burst,,0,Wight channels a portion of spirit and performs a quick slash with their katana. This produces a blue cutter projectile that can slice through the toughest of foes. 3 damage 3 range. (Prof 22) Specter Kegare - Revenant Burst now inflicts a Curse Effect that makes an afflicted unit’s non-attacking rolls suffer a -3 until the status can be staved off. (Prof 35) Persist Spirit - Revenant Burst gains +5 Range (3 to 8).
talent,Wight,Strength of Possession,,1,"Being what is essentially a possessed suit of armor, Wight can disassemble themselves and allow someone else to wear them. Doing this makes it so they share a single turn, gain 2 DR, and have their actions boosted to approximately double effectiveness. This also adds a cursed blue/black/purple flame attribute that can be applied to actions. (Prof 20) Stronger Together - While Strength of Possession is active, both parties get a plus to their rolls equal to their companionship with each other halved rounded down, capping at +5. (Prof 32) Instant Armor - Strength of Possession can be used as an anytime on allies within Wight Movement Speed."
talent,Wight,Thermal Vision,,0,"Designed in the shinobi arts of stealth and assassination, Wight’s vision can view heat on objects. By detecting irregularities in the heat on spaces, Wight can track people’s locations from the very recent past, and see through some illusions and forms of invisibility. Of course, as this relies on heat it only works in the right scenarios."
talent,Wight,Curse Body,,0,"Due to the strange non-biological nature of Wight’s body, they tend to shrug off many status effects. If a status would realistically be ineffective against pure armor, then Wight suffers halved effectiveness from them rounded down (which can theoretically cancel a weaker status outright)."
talent,Wight,"All Armor, No Weakness",,0,"Wight gains 1 DR. In addition, Wight is immune to “critical damage” AKA the increased damage they take due to a crit both from the innate doubling and any other damaging effects."
passive,Wight,Schrödinger’s Samurai,,2,"Due to a combination of their Epithet and their spirit-like makeup, many aspects of Wight are not only in constant flux, but also incredibly unpredictable. At a point of their choosing, Wight can select an aspect of themselves or their kit and make it so one trait of said aspect is certain, while a second is uncertain. The certain trait is definite and unchangeable, while the uncertain trait is vague enough to be arbitrarily malleable to Wight’s (or potentially others’) desires. If Wight ever desires to change the aspect that is affected by this Passive, they must spend 1 stamina at the start of their turn to do so. (Prof 13) Swift Switch - Wight has trained to be swift and decisive when suddenly thrust into unexpected scenarios. Switching out Schrödinger’s Samurai’s targets at the start of Wight’s turn now has a sort of extreme priority to it, meaning that it activates first before Wight suffers any “start of turn” effects like statuses, terrain based effects, or anything of that sort. The switch is effectively always the first thing that happens on Wight’s turn."
passive,Wight,One Man Army,,0,"Their memories may have been lost to time, but within Wight still lingers the art of war they were once so proficient in. Whenever Wight would be attacked successfully while they’ve already been attacked successfully since their last turn, they can make a free counter-attack roll. This not only mitigates damage, but if Wight rolls 3 higher than what their enemy rolled, they can immediately perform an action so long as it’s a damaging action that targets the attacker."
passive,Wight,Collapse of A Dynasty,,0,"Wight can harness the codes of Bushido in combat, and collapse the possibilities of combat into their favor. Whenever Wight is attacked, they place a stack of Bushido on that person. Wight deals +1 damage to targets per Bushido stack they have, and their anytimes used to avoid Wight’s attacks receive an equivalent minus to the roll. Bushido caps out at 5 on a target."
ability,Wight,As The Sun Sets,3,1,"After crouching for a moment, Wight lunges at a target within 4 spaces of themselves, slashing through them and landing up to 3 spaces behind them. At first, despite the spectacle, nothing seems to have happened to the target, but they were most certainly struck by the sword. From here, Wight can activate an anytime to have the effect of the strike occur when they want. This can be straight damage, which usually ranges around 9-12, or potentially something a bit more strange if Wight desires. Stamina cost for this ability is only paid once the anytime is activated, and Wight can only have one use of this ability active at a time."
ability,Wight,Probability Smoke Cloud,3,2,"Wight makes use of the traditional shinobi smoke bomb technique, creating a 3x3 square of white smoke centered on them. While in these smoke clouds, Wight can be in any number of the spaces within, essentially allowing them to warp around at will or act as multiple forces at once. If there are multiple smoke clouds in the arena, Wight can warp between them."
ability,Wight,Wave Function,2,0,"Wight reaches out to an adjacent target and surges a portion of their Epithet into it. This allows them to imbue said target with a weaker version of Wight’s Passive, causing a trait (chosen by Wight) to either become certain or uncertain. This only can apply one effect at once, and is typically weaker than what is gained through Wight’s standard Passive."
ability,Wight,Soul Residue,1,0,"Wight’s blade and armor begin to whistle as a yellow aura surrounds their blade, allowing them to take a definite, observable quality of something with 3 spaces and store it within the sword’s engraving. These properties can be applied retroactively to Wight's As The Sun Sets triggers. If they desire, Wight can use this ability in the form of a sword slash, releasing all qualities with it, augmenting the attack and dealing +3 damage per quality released"
ability,Wight,Eliminate All Possibilities,3,0,"Make the future certain through use of your epithet and an understanding of your opponent. Wight can spend 3 stacks of Bushido on a target, to force their next main action on their turn to be a specific weapon or ability of theirs of Wight’s choice. If they have more than one main action on that turn, Wight can decide all of them. Wight cannot force someone to double move this way. If this ability fails, they only spend 1 stack of Bushido on the target. Bonus Action."
weapon,Javier,Leg Hammer,,0,"Kicks are Javier’s go-to to make people go the hell away. He’s fought his way through quite a few scraps before, so he knows what he’s doing. 5 damage 1 range."
talent,Javier,Effective Reference,,0,"Javier has near photographic memory, and seeing as how he is an artist of sorts, is also particularly good at making scale models. As such, given enough time and materials, he is able to take things he sees and recreate them in figure form."
passive,Javier,It's Free Real Estate,,2,"Javier’s Epithet manifests as a subspacial mini-dimension containing only a strange “house” that is directly linked to Javier’s being. It can only be traveled to by means of a key that Javier possesses, and he has the ability to eject anyone out of the house if he so desires. All of the rooms in this house vary wildly in terms of theming and items within, and Javier is able to link himself to the room he was in most recently. Doing this grants Javier access to the “character sheet” of the room, which follows the primary theming of the room and its contents to create its aspects. The more focused a given room is in theming, the more powerful its kit can be. At base, a room’s character sheet will never be “complete”, lacking multiple things a regular character sheet would normally have, and Javier can exchange any of his own Proficiency Upgrades to give one to a room of his choice. Any items that Javier brings into a room stay in that room until they are specifically moved. Javier’s Current Rooms https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NyzRRSndAS4GMjuIv9-74ek52qbgOhMfJBYZ7lZpxI/edit?usp=sharing (Prof 32) Home Field Advantage - Javier’s house provides him with a natural heightened awareness in combat while he’s inside it, as the house acts as an extension of himself. This means he has advantage on all actions that are targeting an enemy inside his house so long as he is also inside it."
ability,Javier,Trashin' It,3,0,"Javier begrudgingly takes his key and kicks it above a 3x3 area of his choice on the battlefield. The key then clicks into place, opening a door to a room of Javier’s choice as items from the room begin spilling out in a torrent. This deals variable, but large amounts of damage as well as potential status effects depending on the items that come crashing down. Javier can choose one item to keep in the room if he wants, but everything else is fair game to be lost in the scuffle. Of course, if Javier is able to recollect the items, he can place them back into his house, but that’s assuming his enemies will let him. This ability affects everyone in the 3x3 area regardless of allegiance."
ability,Javier,Foxtrot Box,2!,1,"Javier produces a door that he jumps through, thereby producing a correlating door on a space up to 6 away from his current location that he appears out from. These doors remain on the field and have 4 stamina each, as well as produce a pink, 3x3 box around themselves. The box’s walls are intangible and Javier can roll to redirect anything (producing a tangible object/attack) within them through the opposite door and onto a new target for 1 stamina. Or, if he desires, he can roll to store an action used within a box into a chosen room, creating an object representative of said action, which often costs him stamina. Only two doors can be present on the field at a time. Once per Round"
ability,Javier,Picture Perfect,X,0,"With a puff of his cigarette, Javier chooses up to two targets within 7 spaces of each other and rearranges them to make a scene of his liking. He cannot make units use abilities with this, but he is able to pose them however he can imagine. (Prof 38) Composition Opportunity - On top of the chosen cost of Picture Perfect, Javier may choose to pay an additional 3 stamina before rolling. If he succeeds, then he can immediately take an action that isn’t an ability, with the exception being abilities from his currently linked room."
ability,Javier,House Party,3⛯,0,"And YOU’RE invited (whether you like it or not)! Javier kicks an adjacent unit, knocking them into a door which leads to Javier’s currently linked room. Javier jumps in after them, creating a 1-on-1 fight between him and the target. The two fight for three consecutive rounds before the target is forcibly ejected back to where they were. Javier can either come with them, or stay in the house. It takes one full movement action to return to the standard battlefield from his house. Once per Combat."
ability,Javier,Home Away From Home,3,0,"While Javier is never far from his house, he still likes to keep pictures of his house on him. Not to remember them, since he has a photographic memory, but instead to inform others of their artistic setup. By throwing one of these into the center of the room, a sort of holographic projection of a room of his choice becomes overlaid on the arena in an area of equivalent size to the room. This creates an effect in that area based on the aesthetic of the room, decided by Javier. This has an upkeep of 2 stamina a round, unless he is projecting his linked room. Once per Combat."
weapon,Justus,Vicious Riven,,0,"Red energy forms around Justus’s hands to create claws which rake in blood from his enemies. Inflicts 1 Bloody, and heals him for half the damage dealt rounded down. 5 damage 1 range."
weapon,Justus,Taunt,,0,"Does not require a roll. As an action Justus does some kind of cocky flourish or jeer towards an enemy, giving him +1 crit range until he next crits this combat. (Prof 20) Apply Directly To The Forehead - Justus taunts more than just to showboat! I mean… he still does, but he also does it to lure an enemy into a mistake! Whenever Justus uses his Taunt action, the next attack coming against him from a Vassal this round rolls with disadvantage."
talent,Justus,Extreme Crits,,0,Justus’s crits have x3 effectiveness instead of x2.
talent,Justus,Bloody Stream,,0,"At the start of Justus's turn, he may put 1 Bloody stack on himself."
passive,Justus,Til Death Do Us Part,,1,"People call you Prince for a good reason. Your epithet’s primary power allows you to lend a fraction of your own ability, and in return gain supremacy and fealty over that person whether they like it or not. Upon making any kind of physical contact with someone, you may as an unrolled anytime action give them some of your power. This can be an abstract skill such as “general damage” or even another part of your kit, with you inversely losing whatever you give for the combat. However, in return that person becomes your “vassal” for the rest of combat. This affects some of your abilities, and allows your actions to have “supremacy” over theirs. This makes it significantly harder for them to mess with any of your actions when you don’t want them to, and much easier for you to mess with theirs. You also only take 1.5x damage from critical hits by your vassals. Upon a vassal being defeated, you debt a part of their soul in allegiance to you, adding them to your Liege List. Whenever you successfully perform a main action, you can pay 1 stamina and cause spectral versions of a single Liege’s weapons/body parts/other relevant pieces to form around you, as you perform a follow up action that is related to that person in some way. This does not copy their mechanics, rather the follow up relates to the general abilities/fighting style they could accomplish. The more stylish and creative the usage, the stronger the effect. If this succeeds you can do this *again*, so long as you don’t pick the same Liege from earlier in the chain and you pay double the stamina cost, and so on. Liege List: - Jeanne - Minos - Zell Caveat - Gulliver Bradshaw - Atlas Petrov - Tenacious Jack - Manti-CORE - Yig"
ability,Justus,Regicide Curtana,1,0,"Justus uses his epithet to create a ceremonial sword of blood and energy. However, the space it is targeting alters its effects! - If it hits an adjacent target, then it deals an initial 2 damage and inflicts 2 Bloody, followed by a massive kick by Justus himself to launch them high into the air, dealing another 4 damage and giving a general boost to success and damage to any follow up Justus chooses to perform. - If it hits a target 2 range out, they simply take 2 damage and 2 Bloody stacks, and Justus heals for half the damage dealt and half the damage of his follow up, rounded down. - If it hits a target 3 or 4 range out, then instead of a usual hit a trap will be left on the field, composed of epithet nettles. Should an enemy touch it, they will immediately take 7 damage and gain 5 Bloody Stacks. However, this cannot be placed directly on targets. - If between 5 and 8 range, the spike will turn into a scythe during its travel arc, before sticking the target to the ground! They can use half their movement to remove the spike at the cost of taking 3 damage and a Bloody Stack, or they can spend their full movement to remove it safely. Stuck targets take additional damage when they would be knocked back. However, more importantly if this hits Justus can take an immediate move action, which can happen before or after Justus does a follow up with his passive."
ability,Justus,Fury on High,X,1,"From the sky a cannonball-like energy projectile appears, Justus having kicked it and infused it with power before the session. This deals X+2 damage on a 3x3 area that has its origin within 4 to 5 spaces from Justus exactly. It also has a shockwave effect, knocking everyone other than Justus (or any vassals he doesn’t want to move) within 3 spaces of the cannonball back 5 spaces. The cannonball is extremely hard to move except for Justus, who can move it without even being slowed. As a Main Action, Justus can turn the cannonball that’s left on the battlefield into a massive 3x3 gallows platform with a sawblade that deals 2 damage and inflicts 1 Bloody to everyone inside every turn (not rounds) for X turns, before disappearing."
ability,Justus,Public Execution,1/2 current,0,"Justus slashes out some of his own blood, covering a 3x3 area whose center is 4 spaces away from him, stacking 3 Bloody on himself. This blood stays on the battlefield until activated as an anytime, although Justus may have it activate immediately with the same roll as what was used to place it. The blood there is expanded by Justus’ epithet as all targets inside are dragged into the blood like a waste-deep pool, as a massive guillotine is created by Justus’ epithet. He begins laughing maniacally, as all targets take 10 damage and gain 5 Bloody Stacks, and he can perform follow ups with his passive to this regardless of the turn it was used on. Once per Combat."
ability,Justus,Puppet State,1!,1,"Justus pulls around a target Vassal almost like a ragdoll, red energy threads puppeting them around. This allows him to move them up to their movement speed in any direction, even hoisting them up in the air or moving them into harm’s way. It can be used to trip up a target to interrupt their action as well. It can alternatively be used to force the vassal to use an action, so long as that action relies exclusively on physical effort (so for example, activating an epithet is generally mental and thus you could not do that). Once per Round"
weapon,Leon,THE MEGA-GLOVE,,0,"The almighty MEGA-GLOVE of gaming legend. Leon looks rad as hell while punching with it. The MEGA-GLOVE also allows Leon to control any video game or technology!..though the more modern the technology is, the harder it is to control. 4 damage 1 range. (Prof 18) Marth’s Grab Range - The MEGA-GLOVE’s range is increased from 1 to 2. (Prof 45) Sephiroth’s Forward Smash - +1 damage and range to The Mega-Glove (4/2 to 5/3). (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Leon’s technomancy has been enhanced! Controlling technology with The MEGA-Glove is now a Bonus Action. Technomancer Technocrasher - Leon now has Double Advantage on destroying cars (previously Single Advantage)."
talent,Leon,Core Mechanic,,1,"Thanks to his limited control on his epithet’s effects, Leon can decide what kind of game he’s living in at the current moment. At the beginning of a combat/scenario, he can declare what the “mechanic” of the game is. Depending on the mechanic, Leon can decide whether it affects just him, just his party, or everyone in combat. Performing actions according to this mechanic will net Leon bonus points as per Life’s Just a Game (up to GM)."
talent,Leon,Continue?,,1,"When Leon is knocked out for the first time within a combat, any ally can take 10 damage to put in another coin for him, revived with 7 stamina. Talk about bros. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Taking damage from Continue? cannot reduce an ally’s stamina below 1, unless they are one of Leon’s summons."
passive,Leon,Life's Just a Game,,0,"Life for Leon is literally a game, thanks to his Epithet. Leon gains “Points” (stored as his Red Stat) for successfully performing actions, and he can then spend these points on upgrades and powers from classic arcade games. Different actions give different amounts of points depending on the action itself and how successful it is. The more difficult the action, the more points earned, and the more powerful the power-up, the more points it requires (the GM can give Leon points at their discretion). Point Guide: - Dealing damage up to 5 - +50 - Dealing 6+ damage - +100 - Rolling a 20 - +50,  - Basic Actions - +10  - Advanced - +30 - Insane - +50 (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Conditions of the Point Guide now stack with each other. For instance, a “Basic Action” that deals up to 5 damage now grants around 60 points instead of around 50. Along with this, Leon’s summons can now grant him Points with their actions (except for Player 2)!"
passive,Leon,BONUS ROUND!!!,,0,"Using 300 Points (at base), Leon can go into a Bonus Round, giving him an extra turn! Every 50 additional points above 300 that Leon has, his High Score gets updated, which also updates the cost. Using Bonus Round also increases his High Score by 50. This only resets back to 300 upon the session ending. Leon also gets Double Advantage on destroying cars. (Prof 39) Top of the World - Every time Leon gets a High Score, his next roll gets a +3."
passive,Leon,Skill Tree,,1,"Being a Gamer, Leon is used to needing to re-spec to be able to play to his team’s strengths, or the enemies weakness. At any point during combat, Leon can reduce up to two of his “stats” (anything from more standard things like damage, or something more strange like “jump ability”, even max stamina) to amplify another 1-2 stats. The reduction of stats needs to negatively impact Leon in some way. The first time Leon does this within a combat, it is free, but from that point onward, if Leon wants to re-spec himself, he must pay a variable amount of stamina on his turn to do so. If he desires, Leon can place the positive effects of Skill Tree onto an ally within The MEGA-Glove’s range instead of himself. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Instead of “at the start of combat”, Leon can now re-spec via Skill Tree at a point of his choice, further detailed within the new text of the Passive"
passive,Leon,↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Start,,0,"At the start of combat, Leon rolls 5d10 to know the current Code for this fight. If he completes it in order, Leon unlocks Raging Gamer Mode. In this form, everything he does rolls advantage, Leon gains 5 extra movement and a guaranteed success instant transmission free action that he can use on his turn. He also doesn’t pay stamina costs for his abilities, and gains +50 points on the start of all of his turns. - 0 - G̴l͢͟i̧̕ţ̡c͝h͟͠͞ up̧͠ ̧t̛̀͏h̢̕͝ę ̷w̸͡ǫ̸͠rļd̛͘ ̷̧a̧ ̕̕b̸̀͠į̡t̨ ͝şo̢m̴ȩh҉̶͜ǫ̶̀w͏? - 1 - Deal 6 damage or more with a non-ability/non super move attack. - 2 - Dual-Tech successfully with an ally.

Re-roll if there aren’t multiple enemies in the combat. - 8 - Help an ally that’s in trouble! Leon’s summons count as allies for this. - 9 - Top your last High Score. This result can’t be in the code more than once, and, if rolled, is always the last result in the order. - 10 - Have an Epic Gamer Moment. Can be done out of order. (Decided by GM.) - 11 - Blow up the moon again. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Not only have some of the results for ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Start been altered, but also, Leon can choose to maintain the progress for performing the code across combats (but not sessions)!"
ability,Leon,EX Move,X,0,"With a flurry of movements Leon unleashes his Super Gauge! Perform a non-ability action which becomes mystically amplified with energy to have significantly increased effectiveness. Points are required and burned to use this ability (100 base, but more points can be added to further increase the effect). (Prof 60) Retro Revival - While its “base” cost is still 1, EX Move is now an X cost. As with other X costs, Leon can spend more stamina for a bigger payout."
ability,Leon,Power Path,1!,1,"Channeling one of his favorite arcade games, Leon creates a path of up to 5 pixelated pellets connected in a line (each pellet is 1 space/5ft) and munches his way through them, dealing 4 damage to enemies caught in his path and gaining points for objects eaten. This ability can have Leon travel in any direction. Once per Round. (Prof 57) PAC-MAN Fever - When using Power Path, Leon can choose to pay an additional 1 stamina to produce a Power Pellet at the end of his Power Path. If this is done, every enemy that was hit by Power Path goes into “Blue Mode”, where their entire body turns a dark shade of blue. Once they are in this state, Leon’s next attack against them deals 1.5X damage, and grants him boosted points (he even gets Points when using EX Move)! Alternatively, if Leon does not hit any units with Power Path, he can choose to pay the additional 1 stamina to increase Power Path’s range by 4."
ability,Leon,Bootleggin' It!,3⛯,1,"If something has gotten popular, you can be sure someone out there has created a rip-off version. Of course, Leon likes to collect bootleg games and merchandise for fun (he thinks they’re funny). With this knowledge in tow, Leon can channel his Epithet to summon a knockoff version of any character (though their effectiveness is not guaranteed). Once per Combat. (Prof 54) I Choose You! - When using Bootleggin’ It, Leon can choose to instead summon his partner Pokémon: Steelix! Steelix is a 3x3 unit, has 15 Stamina, 4 Movement, and 2 DR. However, Steelix is subject to Pokémon typing modifiers. Due to influence from Leon’s Epithet, Steelix is able to re-spec itself such that it isn’t locked to the typical 4 Moves, and Leon can choose its “Ability” when it is summoned. Summoning Steelix does not spend Bootleggin’ It’s Once per Combat usage. Critting on this variation allows Leon, if he desires, to immediately use another summoning ability as the primary Crit Effect."
ability,Leon,Ultra Combo,3⛯,1,"It’s time for a Killer K-K-K-K-Kombo!! An aura of Gamer energy flares up around Leon, as he goes to go to town on an adjacent unit. This allows Leon to start up a combo chain on the targeted unit, with the roll for activation acting as the first hit. Leon can perform up to 3 attacks in this combo, unless he crits on an attack, which grants him an additional attack above the usual max. Each attack is based off of a fighting game move of Leon’s choice, which can provide variable effects depending on what exactly it is! After any attack in the chain, Leon can choose to cancel the attack into EX Move, which ends the chain immediately after. Much like fighting game combos, depending on the strength of the attacks and the length of the combo, damage is explicitly proliferated. If Leon successfully lands 3 or more attacks with this chain, this ability goes on Recharge 5-6 once it has concluded. Leon can perform this ability by canceling out of either one of his damaging Main Actions or the damaging Main Action of one of his summons, using that as a Hit Confirm. If Leon does this, he must pay 5 stamina for this ability instead of 3, however, assuming the initial “Hit Confirm” successfully connected, the affected unit(s) are unable to use any reactions to stop Ultra Combo as they are stuck in hitstun."
ability,Leon,SUPER Glove Arts,3!,2,"Raising The MEGA-Glove skyward, Leon activates one of his MEGA-GLOVE Arts, all of which have various effects! Glove Arts fade one full round after being activated, although Leon can deactivate one at any time he wants during his turn. The same Art cannot be used back to back, needing a 2 round cooldown period before it can be used again. Twice per Round. - Jump - Leon can jump incredibly high! While this Art is active, when moving, if Leon jumps, he can essentially move freely upwards as if he is flying. This mainly only applies when ascending, during which Leon gets an additional 3 Movement to use to ascend. He also has radically increased air control, to the point of being practically able to float on high rolls. This gives any attacks initiated in the air a +2 to roll, so long as they somehow incorporate his air control. However, Leon also takes 1.5X damage from any attacks that hit him while this Art is active. - Speed - Leon runs at sonic speed! While this art is active, Leon has doubled Movement Speed, and his movements are generally a lot faster than usual. Reactive Actions attempting to dodge or interrupt Leon roll with -2 while this Art is active. If Leon activates this Art in response to an incoming attack, he can attempt to make a separate dodge roll. However, Leon also has restricted air capabilities, specifically hampering any vertical movement he attempts. Along with this, he deals less damage, usually around 2ish less, more or less depending on the attack(s). - Shield - Leon won’t be taken down by anyone! While this art is active, Leon takes less damage from all attacks (no duh). The exact amount of DR is variable, but as a baseline, it is usually around 2-4 OR ⅔ reduction (whichever is greater). Along with this, he is FAR harder to knock prone or inflict knockback upon, as he becomes extraordinarily heavy. However, he also has his Movement Speed reduced by 2 and can’t move around nearly as well or as fluidly as usual. Enemies may be able to react to his actions easier than before. - Buster - Leon is ready to rumble! While this Art is active, Leon’s damage output is increased by a fair amount. By exactly how much is variable, but it is usually at least 2. However, it is far harder to inflict knockback of any kind, and attacks targeting him have an increased Crit Range of 17+ (if it is an AoE that crits from the expanded range, the crit only affects Leon). - Smash - Leon’s gonna finish this fight! While this Art is active, Leon’s attacks inflict a significantly increased amount of knockback, and he has an expanded Crit Range of 17+. However, not only do attacks inflict more knockback on him, but he also has slightly decreased damage across the board. (Prof 60) Retro Revival - Not only has Glove Arts had its effects retooled, but it’s also renamed to SUPER Glove Arts. Radical. Oh also it’s a Twice per Round Anytime now."
ability,Leon,Player 2,3,1,Leon can put another quarter into the machine and give a teammate the experience of being the greatest Gamer on the planet. This summons a 10 stamina Leon Neon that has Leon’s exact kit and powers. Once per Combat.
ability,Leon,Arcade Cabinets,3,0,"Leon can make Arcade Cabinets, almost like his Epithet is Arcade or something. Leon puts The MEGA-Glove to the ground and manifests an Arcade Cabinet up to 2 spaces away from him. This arcade cabinet must be based off of a Cabinet that either exists in real life or is specifically canon to DBA (GAMEMANIA is not allowed). Only one Arcade Cabinet can be on the field at a time, and at any point during his turn, he can have the Cabinet produce an effect/attack relating to its game up to 2 spaces away from it. Cabinets count as summons, and have around 5 stamina. (Prof 50) Technomancer Technocrasher - The cabinets created from Arcade Cabinets explicitly DO count as technology for the sake of The MEGA-Glove."
weapon,Mr Spider,Spider Leg Lances,,0,"A set of, what appears to be, eight blades affixed to Mr. Spider’s back. He controls them in a way that seems very natural as he specifically targets pressure points. On particularly high rolls he may be able to temporarily immobilize selected parts of the target’s body. 5 damage 3 range."
talent,Mr Spider,Business Experience,,0,"Being an industry leader sure is tough work, but it sure does give you a lot of experience on the field. As such, Mr. Spider is very aware of prominent businesses, business workers, and threats to businesses. Plus, he is always ready to promote SpiderCorp!"
talent,Mr Spider,Spider Sense,,0,"Due to a combination of many, many eyes, and a marvelous danger sense, Mr. Spider cannot be blinded, nor can be ambushed."
passive,Mr Spider,Black Widow,,0,"Due to his nature, Mr. Spider is particularly drawn to conflict and the weaving dance it creates. As such, the further enraptured he becomes in a fight, the more fierce he becomes. Each time his webs make contact with a living unit, one of his Spider Leg Lances begins glowing red at its tip. Once all eight have been activated, Mr. Spider’s inner hunter takes over, and his capabilities greatly enhanced. He gains +3 to movement, and a massive boost to the damage and effectiveness of his attacks/abilities. The build-up of this passive carries between combats. (Prof 30) Losers Get Stabbed, It’s That Simple - When Black Widow is active, every attack Mr. Spider lands inflicts a stackable instance of 1d4 damage poison."
ability,Mr Spider,Sticky Situation,1!,1,"Like the tricky bastard that he is, Mr. Spider is able to sneak some webbing from his person onto something or someone else. He can produce the webs from either his hands or his blades, and can then apply the webs in whichever way he sees fit. The webs are incredibly sticky, and, if desired, can be fired up to 5 spaces away from Mr. Spider. Once per round. (Prof 18) Predator VS Prey - If Mr. Spider uses Sticky Situation to pull something towards him, he can immediately stomp it down into the ground, dealing 3 damage and reducing the next movement of the stomped thing by 2. This stomp counts as a basic attack."
ability,Mr Spider,Looks Like You're A Little Tied Up Right Now,3,0,"With a sly smile, Mr. Spider extends his Spider Leg Lances towards an object or person up to 3 spaces away from him and entraps them in a web cocoon. The cocoon can take whatever shape Mr. Spider desires, and once something is wrapped he can always lift it regardless of how heavy it may be."
ability,Mr Spider,A Family Reunion,1,0,"Mr. Spider always carries his legion of baby spiders (branded with the SpiderCorp logo) with him just in case of emergencies. With this ability, he can either call them out to perform an action of his choice or keep them on his body as “armor”. If he is attacked while the armor is up, the spiders scatter off his body and swarm the source of the attack. Each round he maintains the armor, Mr. Spider must pay 1 upkeep. (Prof 27) It’s On The House! - When using Family Reunion, Mr. Spider can make it so the spider babies are holding onto a branded piece of Spider Corp merchandise! Of course, Spider chooses what the merch is. If he does this, the ability costs 2 stamina to use."
ability,Mr Spider,"A Special Surprise, Just For You",2,0,"If there’s one thing Mr. Spider likes doing more than anything else, it’s being a cheeky little shit while others come to a horrible realization. When this ability is activated, Mr. Spider rolls what appears to be a standard basic attack roll. If it is successful, it deals the regular damage, but Mr. Spider has secretly injected a small dose of poison into the target. From here, as an anytime action, he can cause the poison to come into effect, paralyzing the target in their tracks and causing an awful, nauseous feeling. On particularly high rolls, this has the chance to leave the Poison Status on the target even after they are able to move again, taking 1d4 of damage at the start of each of their turns."
ability,Mr Spider,This'll Sting,3,1,"A grin cracks across Mr. Spider’s face as the edges of his mouth sprout a pair of massive chelicerae that latch onto an adjacent unit. This initial bite deals 7-8 damage and causes physical DR a hit unit has to be removed or reduced (if they have any). Mr. Spider can then choose to pay an additional stamina to perform a follow-up kick that deals 3-4 damage and inflicts up to 3 knockback, counting as a basic attack. Along with this, this attack also injects hit units with a “Poisonous Enzyme Status”, which causes their body to begin liquifying as it digests itself. This not only inflicts a -2 roll penalty to all actions for the next round as their body struggles to keep itself solid, but also deals 1d2 damage to an afflicted unit at the start of their turn, which is then given to Mr. Spider as lifesteal. A unit can attempt to dispel this status with a free check at the end of their turn, but rolling lower than a Natural 8 causes the status to worsen, reinstating the roll penalty for an extra round and increasing the damage dice size by 1. When in Black Widow mode, this ability can be used as a Swift Action, but costs 1 extra stamina if used as such"
weapon,Pilot,Bap,,0,Pilot slaps away something he doesn’t really like.
talent,Pilot,Writing On The Walls,,0,"Pilot’s writing becomes nearly impossible to rub off, unless you use a special cleaning rag of his!"
talent,Pilot,Speedy Boy,,0,Pilot gains +1 movement!
talent,Pilot,Put it into Words,,0,"Pilot’s writing transcends language in a weird way, making it so that he can write in any language even if he doesn’t know it himself, and anyone can read and understand what he writes even if they don’t know the language it’s written in."
talent,Pilot,Mightier Than The Sword,,0,"To Pilot, Diplomacy itself is a potent weapon, even if it can devolve into childishly whining for what he wants. From now on, diplomacy checks deal actual damage to people while Pilot is in their presence, even if it’s damage to himself. The more convincing or the more pointed at their philosophy the points made are, the more damage they deal."
talent,Pilot,What Are Words Anyway?,,0,Pilot can now write on non-solids.
passive,Pilot,Signature Technique,,0,"Pilot makes sure people know what is and isn’t his by writing his name on any and all objects he owns. This causes the object to “belong to him”, and as such no one other than himself is allowed to touch the thing written on. For example, this is always already done on Pilot’s clothing, making him repulse bare handed attacks to give them disadvantage and push the attacker away.. It’s also virtually impossible to steal from him. He can write signatures on anything he is currently considered to “own” as a bonus action once per round on his turn. Because of the law, human beings cannot be considered “owned”."
passive,Pilot,Lethal Lexicon,,1,"If any of Pilot’s pen ink is on an enemy and they have 5 or less remaining stamina, they are instantly knocked out."
passive,Pilot,Words To Live By,,1,"At the start of combat, Pilot can flip through his dictionary and choose a word with four or more syllables (or alternatively words obtained with Literary Stray Dog). He then writes this on a special piece of gold leaf paper. For the rest of combat, whoever is holding or is adjacent to this paper can incorporate that word into their actions as secondary effects or modifiers. Passing the paper to an adjacent ally is a bonus action and is created under Pilot’s control, obviously. The papers disappear at the end of combat."
ability,Pilot,Descriptive Verbiage,3,0,"With this ability, Pilot can write some kind of adjective onto an adjacent object, and that object begins to take on the attributes of that adjective! The writing is difficult to scrub off since, I mean, it is ink. It is easier to remove from smooth surfaces like metal, compared to things like cloth. (Prof 16) Written Whimsey - Descriptive Verbiage gets a +1 to its roll for each syllable of the adjective used, minus 1. Literary Stray Dog - If Pilot finds any kind of written documents during the session, he can take information from that and use them in place of an adjective or event when using Descriptive Verbiage or Dear Diary. He can’t do this with things he himself has written."
ability,Pilot,Dear Diary,1!,1,"Pilot tends to take notes of an extraordinary event of today in his journal! Of course, Pilot also has a tendency to… “embellish” a little bit. With this, Pilot can write an action or event that has just happened that was especially outstanding in its application or effectiveness, changing around a few smaller details. Then, he can as an action tear this page out, forgetting the point of having a diary to instead perform the embellished version of the action! He can only have one of these stored at a time. Once per Round. Literary Stray Dog - If Pilot finds any kind of written documents during the session, he can take information from that and use them in place of an adjective or event when using Descriptive Verbiage or Dear Diary. He can’t do this with things he himself has written."
ability,Pilot,Scribble Away,1,0,"When Pilot sees something he doesn’t like, he scribbles over it until he forgets it existed! As such, he can use this ability to scribble over the feature of something, causing that feature to become so muddled and hidden that it completely disappears! This can only work on a really small area at a time. The disappeared objects can only be restored if all the scribbling is rubbed off, which can be difficult!"
ability,Pilot,Letters From Your Secret Admirer,3,0,"Pilot spends this action writing a special logo on an adjacent object. The logo looks really silly and juvenile, like Pilot himself. For the rest of combat, he can pull out a paper with the same logo written on it and write a command as a once per round Bonus Action, causing that object to be compelled to perform said action once he activates the sheet by folding it closed as a Main Action. However, Pilot spends way too much time playing around with swirly writing, so he can only put in one word at a time. This means that he’ll have to spend some time to create more complicated commands. If this is used on a person to activate things like Once per Combats, then the usage of that once per combat is not used up. Only one person can have a logo on them at a time in a combat."
ability,Pilot,Period.,1!,2,"With this, Pilot can add or alter a single instance of punctuation in an ability or effect for the round. This lets him alter how certain things are read and by extension how the effect performs. Often the most effective use of this is to boop little periods in the middle of sentences, although he can do more than that. Once per Round."
weapon,Simone,Dark Side of the Mind: Cognitive Claw,,0,"Channeling her negative thoughts and emotions and manifesting them as a shadow aura overtaking a limb of her choice, Simone lunges to strike. This deals 3 damage, and she can jump one extra space when initiating the attack, effectively giving it 2 range. [RIDBI’S SPECIAL EFFECTS] - Cognitive Claw's damage is increased by 1 (3 to 4), and Simone can choose to reduce gravity's effects on things she attacks with it."
weapon,Simone,Dark Side of the Mind: Psycho Ball,,0,"Simone clasps her hands together, producing a ball of shadow energy within them. By spending her movement action, she can charge this attack, increasing its damage and range by 2 each time that she does."
talent,Simone,Dowsing Rod,,0,"Simone’s mind is attuned to the world around her, giving her advantage on finding hidden objects and locations, as well as always directing her towards underground sources of water."
passive,Simone,Nerve Connection,,1,"Simone’s ESP makes it so she is constantly in control of her mental prowess and her cognition’s impact on reality. With this power, she can imbue the world around her with lines of her psychic energy. Whenever she performs a damaging action, the spaces the action traveled across have a psychokinetic Ley-Line placed upon them. She can have any number of these lines on the field at a given time. - Enemy Contact - If an enemy touches one of these lines, it explodes, dealing 3 damage to the enemy and, if she/they are adjacent to the line in question, allowing Simone or a chosen ally to immediately move up to the enemy and perform a basic attack on them. - Movement Shift Effect - If Simone is standing on a space with a line on it, she gains a once per round anytime that allows her to move anywhere on said line or any connected lines. She must pay 1 stamina to do this, and using this anytime removes the initially used line from the field. - X Formation - If Simone manages to make an “X” pattern using two lines, the lines begin spinning in circles rapidly. While in this state, they no longer collide with enemies, and cannot be used for Simone’s Movement Shift Effect. However, at the start of Simone’s next turn, all enemies standing within the spinning radius of the larger line take damage equivalent to the amount of spaces long the shorter line is. (Prof 35) Mental Fortitude - Once per Combat, Simone can choose a line from Nerve Connection that would normally disappear for whatever reason. The line does not disappear this one time. If Simone desires, she can choose for this effect to happen again (ignoring the OPC restriction), but each time she does, she takes increasing instances of 2 stamina."
ability,Simone,Extrasensory Emission,3,0,"Extending a palm forward, Simone fires a rainbow colored beam in a 1x6 line. Any enemies who are hit by this attack take 5 damage and are sent flying to the end of the beam, as their minds are scanned by Simone’s psychic powers. This causes a property based effect to be returned to Simone, which she can apply to her actions. If the beam hits a line created from her Passive, the properties are instead siphoned into the lines, giving them Passive effects. This also increases the damage the line deals in any attacks it is involved in by 1. (Prof 24) Esper Trailing - Simone can now choose to have Extrasensory Emission bend at any point in its firing. Instead of creating one line via Nerve Connection, this causes the line to split whenever a bend occurs."
ability,Simone,Telekinetic Dream,2!,1,"Simone’s eyes glow a bright blue as she extends a hand towards a target of her choice. This target, which can be herself, begins floating in the air, at the mercy of Simone’s whim. From here, she can choose to either toss something up to 6 spaces away, or take advantage of a grabbed enemy’s position and perform a basic attack of her choice on them. This basic attack does not need to be rolled for. Once per Round. (Prof 33) Phantom Fandango - When holding a unit in place with Telekinetic Dream, Simone can instead have an ally adjacent to her, the unit in question, or one of her lines perform the follow-up basic attack on the unit. Along with this, Telekinetic Dream gains a usage separate from its usual Once per Round that can only be used on Simone’s turn, costs an additional 2 stamina, and is typically reduced in effectiveness. Its Basic Attack Variation has its damage reduced by up to half, and the attack itself must be rolled for."
ability,Simone,Magnet Bomb,3⛯,1,"Extending a finger forward, Simone produces a small, purple ball that follows her finger’s movement while sparking with energy. She then fires the ball as a projectile out anywhere within 4 spaces of her current position, causing it to explode in a cloud of discharged electricity. Once the explosion occurs, all enemies within 7 spaces of it are dragged up to 4 spaces closer to the impact point, taking 1 damage for each space moved. If an enemy is adjacent to the impact point upon the initial explosion, they automatically take 7 damage, and if someone is dragged into the adjacent area, they take an extra point of damage. Once per Combat. (Prof 27) Second Wind - Magnet Bomb is now twice per combat, but costs 4 stamina instead of 3 on the second usage."
weapon,Wesley,Chained Pole Vault,,0,"A bojutsu staff/pole that can extend into dual sided, chain sickles if need be. The pole normally has 2 range and deals 5 damage, but extending it reduces its damage by 1 for each added space of range. Has a maximum of six range. (Prof 23) Deadly Technique - +1 Range (2 to 3). In addition, if extended to its full length, the Chained Pole Vault now inflicts a slight bleed status that Wess can choose to either cause one damage to them at the start of their turns or reduce physical damage they deal by 1 until they get rid of it. (Prof 52) Never Know What Hit ‘Em - Whenever Wess deals damage with Chained Pole Vault, he may pay 1 stamina to have that damage become undodgeable as his pole becomes warped through space-time. The first anytime action taken against it is done so with disadvantage."
talent,Wesley,"Shit, It's The Fuzz!",,0,"Wess doesn’t need time bullshit to know when the cops are on his tail. Whenever someone is specifically targeting/trying to catch him, he essentially has a 50ft spider sense. (Prof 32) Danger Sense - Wess saw a guy do this one. Wess can reduce his “Spider Sense” aura to a mere 10ft, however, he has a +3 to countering, dodging or interfering with anyone specifically targeting him, but a -2 to do those things that are coming from outside of the aura."
talent,Wesley,Millennium Gear,,0,"An incredibly large gear filled to the brim with energy of the chronal variety. Once per Combat, someone touching it may cause their action to speed up by an incredible degree, forcing their next action to both be rolled with advantage due to having more than enough time to correct any simple mistakes they would have. Along with this, reactions to that action have a -3 due to trouble perceiving it correctly. If a character has a Time related resource, however, they may instead Once per Session drain the gear of a vast amount of energy, completely topping off their resource if it has a cap, or giving them 10 if it does not. If this is used the “per combat” effect cannot be triggered during that session, and vice versa."
talent,Wesley,Rowdy Boy,,1,"You may have noticed, but Wess is...well...Wess. And that can be very distracting to others. As a response to an enemy performing an action Wess can Wess it up and perform a non-damaging, 1 cost anytime action to attempt to distract them so long as they are within eyesight and earshot. He can also pull out simple items, like a guitar or soda cans, on his turn. (Prof 40) Movie Buff - Wess is quite the movie boi. When pulling out an item with Rowdy Boi he may pull out a movie prop based on one of the many many movies he has seen in his time. This prop may have some of the functionality of the item in the movie though at a weaker level. He does still have to roll for this, but the roll may be boosted depending on the description of the movie and where the item was used. This has the same usage as his usual item pull, and the GM or even Wess himself may increase the stamina cost to get unique things out."
talent,Wesley,Ragazzi Turbolenti,,2,"Ragazzi Turbolenti - Once per Session, at any time, Wess can start doing a dance as music comes out of nowhere. After one round another Wess shows up and also starts dancing, and one round after that a third Wess joins in on the dance, and finally, the round after that, they can all get to take a full turn at the same time. The only limitation is that they must target different people. They have all of Wess’ current T.E. and the main Wess is the one that takes stamina costs, but they have their own individual ability usages. While they are dancing only the main Wess can actually take actions on their turn and the other ones just follow his movement, engrossed in the dance. (Prof 60) Velocità Ragazzi - One of the other Wess’s appears immediately and starts a dancin’ (This makes it so it takes 3 Rounds to “charge” instead of 4)."
passive,Wesley,Off The Clock,,2,"Wess has a red stat in the form of Temporal Energy that he builds up over time. He has a max of 14, and gains one automatically at the start of his turn. Whenever he deals or takes damage, he also gains half (rounded up) of it as T.E. As an anytime action, he can spend 7 T.E. to perform a minor time skip, canceling the ending of an action and allowing him to immediately follow up with a second action. This combo action is often scaled slightly, dealing less damage, and Wess does not gain any T.E. from combo’d actions. Any enemies adjacent to Wess when he activates this are temporarily slowed down, cutting their next movement in half and making interrupt anytimes harder to initiate until the end of their next turn. (Prof 30) Rad Roman - Once per Combat, Wess may spend only 4 T.E. to perform a minor time skip. Also, the first time he deals damage from a combo action, not only does the damage not get reduced, but he also gains a quarter of the damage rounded up as T.E., Once per T.E. combo. (Prof 60) After Hours - Wess is becoming more creative with his epithet and is now coming up with new ways to use all that Temporal Energy he is building up. The usage for the T.E. he has follows the same rules as with “Off The Clock” with the exception of it not being considered an anytime but still being able to be used on his own turn or not, there is no limit to how many times he may do this per round or turn so long as he has the T.E. and it isn’t stated otherwise. The new usages are as follows; - Now In 3-D (4 T.E.) - Wess may take an action that he is performing and split it into 2 halves, one Red and one Blue, these halves are weakened to half of their power (rounding up). Wess can strain his epithet to slightly stretch how these halves work, but each must be done so in different ways. This may increase stamina costs slightly. If he does this as a part of an “Off The Clock” action, the entire thing may be affected by this.  - You’re Slower Than I Expected (7 T.E.) - Wess may make a basic attack and inflict 1d2 “Slow” to a unit that is not afflicted with it already. Once per Turn. - I Don’t Gotta Make Fancy Names For All Of These Right? (4 T.E.) - Wess can take a Movement Action. - I Do? Well Damn….Alright. (4 T.E.) - Wess can take an additional Bonus Action. - Ey! I’m Going Again! (7 T.E.) - Wess can use an Anytime Action without taking up its Once per Round usage. - Peace Sign! (X T.E.) - Wess can spend as much T.E. as he likes up to his current total to smile and give a peace sign to grant himself a multitude of buffs, the memories of his mother and his own determination coming through to give him inner strength.This can grant him a +1 to rolls, crit range, and movement (each increased separately) for each T.E. he spends up to a maximum of 4 for 1 round, which can also be increased by 1 for every 2 T.E. he spends. - This Is Gonna Be Useful! (14 T.E.) - Permanently increase the total T.E. that Wess can store for the rest of the session by 7."
ability,Wesley,"Thanks, Einstein",3!,2,"As we all know, time is relative. It’s often hard to perceive two events happening at the same time. Using this to his advantage, Wess messes with the time stream to cause an event from the past or future to happen simultaneously with another one. This often causes a change in the interrupted event. Once per Round. (Prof 43) Applied Relativity -  “Thanks, Einstein” can now be used easier on things that are close enough to what Wess has immediately available to him (e.g. having seen a door open can be used to potentially open nearly any door like a vault door or a car door or even flipping a coin could allow him to flip a table, though that might incur additional stamina costs)."
ability,Wesley,With Relative Ease,2,0,"Everything’s different from every person’s point of view. Due to this, Wess can morph the size of something based on how he currently sees it. He can then reposition the changed object to a location (on the battlefield) of his choice. (Prof 37) Ease Indeed - The stamina cost of this ability is reduced from 3 to 2."
ability,Wesley,Backlog Overflow,X⛯,1,"As a Bonus Action on his turn, Wess can store a chosen action in the Temporal Energy flowing around him. This is often indicated by him spinning his pole around in a very rapid fashion. Then, when he desires, he can let all of these actions out at once. For each turn of non-ability actions built up, he pays 1 stamina and all abilities cost their standard amount. Once per Combat. (Prof 58) Action Overflow - Backlog Overflow can now be used as a free action to store a basic attack action on Wess’ turn, once per turn. It still otherwise retains its Bonus Action usage."
ability,Wesley,Hey! Check This Out!,2,1,"Wess finger guns at the nearest ally he likes or, alternatively, a middle finger to the nearest enemy he does not like. He then proceeds to dash up to 5 spaces and pole vault into the air, performing a trick of his choice while airborne, which may or may not add a minor extra effect to the dropkick he lands into an enemy’s face for 6 damage and 1-2 knockback. (Prof 49) Hey! Check THAT Out! - When using “Hey! Check This Out!”, Wess now leaves a space-time echo of himself in his original position. For the time it is around, Wess can not only use its position for anything that requires positional relativity but he can also, as a 1 cost anytime, return to its position, erasing it but moving him out of danger. He must pay 1 upkeep at the start of his turns to keep it around. He may only have one ST-Echo out at a time."
ability,Wesley,Too Slow!,3⛯,1,"Wess smirks before jabbing a hand into an adjacent opponent. This causes temporal energy to swirl around inside of them, slowing their movements to a crawl. They are now inflicted with a “Slowed” Status, which lasts 1d3+1 rounds. From here, the molecules around them move so slowly that the unit takes 2 ice damage at the start of their turns, and their vision is reduced immensely, reducing all their ranges to 2, but this starts to return to normal by 1 at the start of their turns until the status is gone. Also, their movement and results of all rolls are reduced by the amount of rounds the status has left remaining. Similarly, they take that much extra damage whenever they are attacked, as the attack feels longer to them. Once per Combat."
ability,Wesley,I Saw This In A Movie Once,X,0,"Wess is able to channel the power of his epithet with “he has seen a lot of movies” to recreate a classic scene from one of those movies, with his epithet assisting him and producing simple yet functional props for him to use. Usually they’d be from an action movie, but pretty much anything goes so long as it is from a movie and Wess says a cool one-liner to go with it. Stamina Cost is determined by the GM, but they may reduce or increase it depending on how cool the one-liner is. This can be used in conjunction with Rowdy Boi to boost the effectiveness or even create crossovers with different movie props."
weapon,Kazuma,Thousand Shoves,,0,"Kazuma solidifies his stance before unleashing one of two different shoving techniques. Either: - He unleashes a flurry of slaps, dealing 6 damage as the target is forced to endure the barrage. - He puts all his strength into one giant push, dealing 3 damage and pushing the target backwards 3-4 spaces."
talent,Kazuma,Super Duper Sumos for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance,,0,"Kazuma, despite what you may think, is actually quite a big gamer. As such, he always has a Nintendo GameBoy Advance SP on him at all times."
talent,Kazuma,Earthbound Pillar,,0,"If Kazuma does not use his movement action during his turn, he enters a traditional “Sumo Stance”: with outward-extended legs and hands on his knees. As this occurs, Kazuma begins to heat up, expelling steam as his position is solidified. While this stance is active, it is significantly more difficult to inflict knockback/prone effects upon him. The next action Kazuma performs after activating the stance becomes a Burning Action, granting the action extra fire based effects/damage."
talent,Kazuma,Purifying Salts,,0,"As per sumo tradition, Kazuma carries salt around with him to purify the battlefield and others around him. He can, as a Bonus Action, throw salt at a unit/space within 3 of his current location, which can clear negative status effects or ongoing/environmental effects the salt makes contact with, as Kazuma uses his Epithet to bolster the presence of the salt. Along with this, when placing down the ring produced from The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall, Kazuma can pay 1 stamina to spread this salt across the area the ring covers (which is unrolled)."
passive,Kazuma,"The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall",,0,"Every time Kazuma engages in combat, it somehow morphs into a sumo match. Due to this, a red circle appears on the ground around Kazuma at all times, acting as a 3 space (15 ft aura). Once he attacks a target, he can choose for the circle to lock to the ground, and if anyone steps out from inside of it (or is pushed out), they take 3-6 damage. Similarly, any attacks initiated from someone inside the circle has the chance to knock someone else inside the circle down, dealing additional damage if any part of their body aside from their feet touches the ground. Of course, Kazuma can also be knocked down and/or pushed, but it’s relatively hard to do so. If he desires, he can also spend 1 stamina to transform the circle back into an aura as a Bonus Action, but he cannot replace the ring in the same turn. (Prof 27) Gentleman of Strength - Any of Kazuma’s actions that he makes inside of the ring automatically become “Rikishi Actions”. Rikishi actions are significantly harder to directly counter, take head-on or stop unless another Rikishi Action is being used against it. Anyone else inside of Kazuma’s ring may convert an action they are taking into a Rikishi Action so long as they pay 1 extra stamina and it mostly conforms to the honorable way of the sumo."
ability,Kazuma,"I Like Them Big, I Like Them Chunky",2!,1,"With an intense stare, Kazuma begins marching over to a chosen target. He intercepts any attacks along the way, taking reduced damage as he is unphased movement wise. Once he reaches the target, he can immediately perform a singular push on them. Once per Round. (Prof 30) Power Through - When Kazuma tanks through an attack(s) using “I Like Them Big, I Like Them Chunky”, his Epithet produces a Mawashi that has absorbed energy from said attack(s). From there, Kazuma gains access to a one-use ability that takes the form of a sumo wrestling technique with properties of the attack that formed that particular Mawashi. This ability can be carried between Combats and Sessions, and if it is used to knock out a unit, it becomes a “Kimarite Ability” that Kazuma keeps permanently."
ability,Kazuma,The Girthquake,3,0,"Kazuma performs the signature sumo stomp, cracking the earth in either a 4 space straight line or in a radius affecting all spaces adjacent to him. Anyone hit by this takes 3-7 damage and is instantly knocked Prone. (Prof 16) Controlled Girth - The Girthquake no longer has friendly fire, and has its minimum damage increased to 5 (from 3)."
ability,Kazuma,Folding Space,2!,1,"Kazuma claps and a set of traditional japanese folding screens appears in an area of his choice. These can either increase the “thickness” of the space between two objects, making them further apart and reducing the effectiveness of attacks launched within that space, or open up in the path of an attack/action, increasing the “thickness” of objects that pass through in order to increase their size and/or damage. Once per Round. (Prof 22) Rosewood Paneling - When creating the folding screen using Folding Space, Kazuma can choose whether it has 2, 4, or 6 panels that make it up. Making it with 2 may make it slightly weaker but gives it anytime priority and harder to counter. Making it with 4 is the same as normal. Making it with 6 may make it a lot more effective but easier to counter."
ability,Kazuma,Makushita Division,X,0,"Kazuma sticks his hands outward, producing an Epithetical, red wall that takes up to a XxX area (Each dimension can only be up to a maximum of 5) (Cost is equal to half of the size of the largest dimension rounding up). This wall acts as a barrier/shield, making it so that enemies and enemy attacks cannot pass through it easily if at all. This wall remains on the battlefield until destroyed or dismissed, and if Kazuma is adjacent to it, it is typically more effective as he uses his strength to fortify it. If he desires, he can produce a wall up to 3 spaces away from him, facing in any direction, but in this case its maximum size is reduced. This ability can be used as a Bonus Action, but if it is, the wall only lasts until the end of Kazuma's tur"
weapon,Carnation,Catastrophe Chainsaws,,0,"Carnation’s arms spin around and reveal two chainsaws constructed of stainless steel. As one may expect, they are incredibly fucking deadly. 5 damage 1 range."
weapon,Carnation,Gatling Gun Genocide,,0,"With a bit of whirring, Carnation fires a volley of high speed bullets out of his arms at a chosen target. 4 damage 3 range."
talent,Carnation,CURRENT_OBJECTIVE,,0,"As he’ll be sure to remind you, Carnation’s objective is to eliminate the workers of DBA who betrayed him and his siblings. Therefore, he deals 1.5 damage to anyone who is an active worker at DBA and also anything DBA owns."
talent,Carnation,Binary_Beatdown.exe,,0,"If Carnation successfully attacks a target, he may mark them as a “1”, at the end of combat he receives stamina equal to one third of the targets marked with this rounding up, to a maximum of 5 (being a powerhouse does not change this amount)."
passive,Carnation,Back With A Vengeance,,0,"Carnation’s origins as a balancing robot makes it so he is connected to a constantly fluctuating power system. However, since he defected, he has managed to reprogram this balance program in order to assist him and him alone. With this, the worse Carnation and his team are doing compared to the enemy(s), the stronger he becomes. Since his damage and movement boost(s) are tied to how behind his team is, the extent of this passive’s boost is therefore determined by the GM. This effect cannot impact Carnation negatively due to how he has reprogrammed his functions."
passive,Carnation,Extended Warranty,,0,"While Carnation was designed to decent specifications, this will now come back to haunt his creators, as he will not be defeated by the corroding hands of time. When hit by a status effect it will always end a maximum of two rounds after he received it."
ability,Carnation,Metallic Madness,3,0,"After some loud beeping and buzzing, Carnation sticks his arms into the ground and a large, steel wire shoots out of the ground in an area of his choosing. From there, it can either latch onto a nearby unit or object and grapple them or transform into a metal structure of Carnation’s choice. These wires can be exploded as an anytime action. (Prof 16) Link Cable - If Carnation uses Metallic Madness on a willing target, he does not need to tie them down, merely connect to them. While connected to them, he may trade abilities with them. Each target must give an ability so that the total amount of techniques they have access to does not change. Carnation may not get rid of Metallic Madness with this. When the cord is severed, all abilities return to their original owner."
ability,Carnation,Cringe Before Carnation,1!,0,"After someone fails an action, Carnation can analyze their weakness in order to discover how to kill them easier. With each of his scans, Carnation gains a +1 to damage dealt against the scanned unit. Upon reaching three scans on one unit, Carnation is able to create a new ability specifically designed to eliminate said target. He keeps this for the rest of combat, and it only takes a single scan to regain this ability in future combats. Once per round. (Prof 8) Enhanced Scanning - Cringe Before Carnation is now twice per round, as long as each use is on separate people. [RIDBI’S STYLISH LESSON] - When using Cringe Before Carnation, if Carnation rolls the same number as the person he is scanning, the ability automatically succeeds and gives Carnation +2 damage against them instead of +1."
ability,Carnation,Retribution Ray,3⛯,1,"Carnation reels back as a panel opens up on his chest, revealing a glowing power core inside of him. After a moment of charging, he fires a massive lazer that consists of light, fire, or electricity. It deals 8-15 damage and has the chance of inflicting statuses based on which element the lazer is composed of. If Carnation desires, he can maintain the lazer fire over the duration of a round, as well as change its direction at the start of his next turn so long as he pays an extra 2 stamina. Once per Combat."
ability,Carnation,Electric Overclock,3⛯,0,"Upkeep Ability. Carnation’s power core is incredibly useful, but sometimes it does not give as much power as he would need. With this he can set himself into overclocked mode where he gains an additional move action per turn and bonus electric damage to his attacks. At the start of his turn, when Carnation pays the 1 upkeep, a bolt of electricity will arc up to 3 spaces to hit the nearest enemy for 3 damage as an unrolled free action. Once per Combat."
weapon,Beowulf,Susan The Spiteful,,0,"3 damage 1 range. Beowulf’s first sword, gained after he was rejected on the elementary school playground. Due to when he got this sword, it is a bit on the shorter side, not unlike Susan’s patience regarding Beowulf. As it was forged from a playground incident, Beowulf can use this in the middle of a move action. It gains advantage when he uses it to hit a dodgeball."
weapon,Beowulf,Blair The Bitch Witch,,0,"5 damage 1 range. Created after Beowulf attempted to attain the elusive “big tiddy goth gf”, this sword contains a dark power. This is partially due to the fact that Beowulf made its hilt black to remind him of who inspired it, and partially due to Blair cursing it once she saw Beowulf the second time. It inflicts a curse status on rolls 15 or higher, causing a unit to take 1d4 damage at the start of their turns for 1d3+1 turns. However, every third time Beowulf uses this sword, he is automatically inflicted with the curse, regardless of whether his attack was successful."
weapon,Beowulf,Penelope The Projectile Haver,,0,"2 damage 5 range.When Beowulf first tried hitting on this girl, she threw everything in the nearby vicinity at him, which was quite rude. This memory stuck with him, and thus this sword is used as a projectile. Pushes hit targets back 2 or more spaces once they are hit."
weapon,Beowulf,Buster The Bro,,0,"7 damage 2 range. After being rejected so many times, Beowulf figured that dudes may be more of his forte. They weren’t. This is a huge ass buster sword with cleaving properties. However, whenever Beowulf uses this sword, his next movement action is halved. (Prof 12) Better Blacksmith - +1 damage and range to Buster the Bro (7 to 8 and 2 to 3)."
weapon,Beowulf,Gnatasha The Gnarly,,0,"5 damage 1 range. There was this one surfer chick that both rejected Beowulf and showed him up in a contest of who can literally jump the shark. This experience led to Beowulf taking one of the shark’s teeth that found its way into his shoulder to make a new sword. Due to its shape, it not only has piercing properties, but also has a tendency to get stuck into people. Essentially, this allows Beowulf to grapple, forcing targets to make a check to escape on their turn (I mean, unless they want to stay firmly shish-kebabed). Each round a target is continuously grappled, they take 2 damage."
weapon,Beowulf,Jade The Joker,,0,"1 damage 1 range. Beowulf was feeling very lonely and/or desperate, and tried hitting on a birthday clown. All this led to was sadness and a balloon poodle. Beowulf then reassembled the poodle into a sword and began using it as one of his many. Despite it being a balloon, he has practiced with it enough to allow him to deal 1 damage with it as a melee weapon. Plus, hitting with it either inflicts wild magic or allows Beowulf to follow up with a small, clown related bonus action. (Prof 12) Better Blacksmith - +1 damage and range to Jade the Joker (1 to 2 and 1 to 2)."
weapon,Beowulf,Echo The Elusive,,0,"This gal may have assumed Beowulf’s likeness, but definitely not to the point where she liked him. Green never was Beowulf’s favorite color anyways. Beowulf is able to model this sword off of one of his fellow party members, with its stats, effects, and appearance dependent on his choice. It’s always green though."
weapon,Beowulf,Wren The Wretched,,0,"5 damage 3 range. This lady’s pretty old, but thankfully, Echo made sure to check in to see my chances. I’ve been hearing some pretty weird things about this lady though. Apparently, I may be walking on thin fucking ice. This sword is covered in golden leaves along with a similar golden trim, and a deep black hilt. Upon hitting an initial target, Beowulf can have some of the leaves fire off it, hitting an adjacent unit for 4 damage. This can be done one more time, requiring another roll, and dealing 3 damage to this final unit in the chain."
weapon,Beowulf,Jack-O'-Lantern The Jovial,,0,"4 damage 2 range. Looks like the only thing that’s a ghost this Halloween is Beowulf’s happiness. This sword has a jack-o’-lantern on the bottom of its hilt, with the rest of the hilt being made of a similarly orange material with vines wrapped all around it. The end of the blade has the signature curvature of a scythe. The Jack-o’-Lantern at the hilt has two faces, one representing fire and one representing ice. Every time Beowulf uses the sword, the current face’s corresponding element becomes strengthened. Eventually, Beowulf may even be able to cast magic spells from the sword based in said element. However, if Beowulf ever fails an action using this sword, the face automatically switches, reverting Beowulf’s elemental control back to base."
weapon,Beowulf,Felfra The Fallen,,0,"4 damage 1 range, or 1 damage 4 range. Damn bro, your girlfriend is the moon? I thought the moon WAS an old lady and is NOW a Katamari, but like…that’s rough. Combining two edgy themings into one, this sword is a cutlass-style gunblade with the “blade” fashioned into a glimmering angel wing, and the “gun” being present near the blackened hilt which transitions into a red, demon wing barrel. The blade has a maximum of 6 bullets loaded into it, and whenever Beowulf successfully attacks with the melee version of this weapon, he can pay 1 Stamina to immediately fire a shot. The shots deal fire damage, and if hitting an adjacent unit, they explode for 3 damage instead of their standard 1, also dealing up to 3 knockback. Additionally, if the most recent sword Beowulf used was Felfra the Fallen, he can use a once per round anytime to fire a shot! This also costs 1 Stamina, and does not explode when hitting adjacent units. If Beowulf wants to reload with this weapon, he needs to use a Main Action."
passive,Beowulf,Super Cool Ultra Secret Technique #7: Beowulf the Wondrous and His Ultimate Blade Barrage,,1,"Upon using all of his swords at least once, Beowulf gains access to his trump card. This Passive becomes a 7 cost ability that covers a 7x7 area with Beowulf at its center. The allotted area shines a bright gold as Beowulf’s swords fly out of their sheaths and are suspended in midair. From there, Beowulf disappears for a moment before apparating by each of his swords and performing a series of sweeping slashes across the area. Finally, he zooms high into the sky as he becomes his own final sword: Beowulf the Bastard, reflecting his never ending quest for validation as he divekicks back down. This deals around 10-17 damage to all enemies within the area and inflicts all sword effects without the downsides for Beowulf himself. Upon using this, Beowulf’s sword uses are considered to be back at zero, requiring him to use all of them once again if he wants to use this ability. Sword usage is not carried between combats."
ability,Beowulf,The Helicopter Chopper,2,1,"Beowulf spins one of his swords all quick-like. He can use this to create a sword buzzsaw that deals sword damage +4 and can be maintained over the course of a round, a quick spin slash that hits all adjacent units (or more depending on the sword) for sword damage +2, or as makeshift helicopter blades that Beowulf can use to fly."
ability,Beowulf,A Dashing Maneuver for a Dashing Fellow,2!,1,"Unsheathing one of his swords in an instant, Beowulf dashes up to 4 spaces in any direction of his choosing. This shields him from incoming attacks, and he can choose to either lead with his swords to deal their normal damage to a hit target, or to instead quickly grab a target before pulling them into a brutal backstab. The latter deals an extra 5 damage and halves a unit’s next Movement Action, but is generally harder to land in regards to the counterattack. Once per round. (Prof 8) Backstab Brutality - When Beowulf uses the backstab version of ‘Dashing Maneuver For A Dashing Fellow’, it will now always deal 5 (increased from 2-3) additional damage and halve the chosen target’s movement (as opposed to having a chance to simply reduce)."
ability,Beowulf,Storm of Swords,4⛯,1,"Beowulf quickly flicks his fingers across three of his swords before a black blur overtakes a 2x4 area in front of him. Colored slashes representing each of the swords he picked cut wildly through the cloud, revealing the latest victims of this sick move. This deals the damage of the 3 swords combined, and potentially even more to everyone within the area while also inflicting each of the swords’ effects. Once per Combat."
ability,Beowulf,The…Ssssssss...Forgemaster,1,0,"That sound was Beowulf inhaling sharply through his teeth, not the sound of the bellows on his portable blacksmith’s forge blowing, but that does also happen. Beowulf chooses one of his swords and also takes one of the weapons of an adjacent ally, placing them intimately close to each other on his anvil. Scootch just a little closer, you two. Yeeeaah. That’s the stuff. He then gets to work with his hammer, enhancing his chosen sword with one property of the weapon, and vice versa. It could be a specific effect, or just a little bit of extra damage. This counts as using the chosen sword for Technique #7. If any enemies are adjacent to Beowulf when he uses this, they take minor fire damage as the sparks fly. Note that he can grab a weapon from an ally during his movement and then continue moving before fully using this ability. The ally gets the weapon back immediately no matter what. These additional effects last for the rest of the session by default, but if he uses the same enhancement repeatedly in the same session, they can become much more permanent at the GM’s discretion. Once per Two Rounds, he can use this as a Bonus Action."
weapon,Cosmo,Ignition Riot,,0,"One of Cosmo’s limbs begins burning bright, smoke expelling off of it. Then, in an instant, he bursts forward with an attack of explosive proportions. Cosmo can choose to have this attack carry him, and anyone it may hit, up to 4 spaces in any direction."
weapon,Cosmo,Popgun Dynamite,,0,"Cosmo pulls out his trusty popgun, and upon firing it, 4 Epithet based bottle rockets come soaring out. These rockets can be individually directed at anyone on the field, with each rocket dealing 1 damage. Infinite range. (Prof 84) Free-Flying Rockets - Popgun Dynamite is now always a Bonus Action to use. Along with this, Cosmo can choose to have any of the bottle rockets created from it stay suspended in empty spaces of his choice. When an enemy collides with one of these bottle rockets, they take 2 damage and are inflicted with minor knockback. This enables follow-up attacks combo’d after one of these hits to roll with advantage. If Cosmo chooses to set up any of the initially created bottle rockets this way, he gains one extra bottle rocket to place as he pleases."
weapon,Cosmo,Symbol of Spirit,,1,"6 damage 3 range. Cosmo’s Golden Artifact, a weapon granted to him via his connection to Clay Granton. Symbol of Spirit is a massive golden flagpole, with its respective flag featuring a stylized rendition of Planet Earth with a rocket orbiting it. This weapon’s attacks remove DR from those it hits. As a movement or main action, Cosmo can set the flag down into a chosen object or surface, and doing so causes it to produce a 10 ft aura from itself. While in this state, all allies within the aura and Cosmo (regardless of whether or not he is in the aura) are able to incorporate properties and/or powers of whatever the flagpole is currently in into their actions. Along with this, he can use Symbol of Spirit to simply produce normal flagpoles anywhere adjacent to him."
talent,Cosmo,Zero Gravity,,0,"Cosmo is immune to gravitational based effects, and is able to jump way higher than most people. He similarly has no issue maneuvering himself in the air."
talent,Cosmo,Space Race,,0,"Due to his Epithet’s influence over his genetic make-up, Cosmo’s movement is increased by 2 and he is able to fly."
talent,Cosmo,To Infinity And Beyond,,0,"Whenever Cosmo or one of his allies critically succeed on a Natural 20, their next roll has advantage."
talent,Cosmo,The Dog Talisman,,1,"A small stone talisman that can fit in your hand. Once per Session, for the length of 2 rounds, the user can activate this by spending 5 max stamina at anytime speed. When activated the user can no longer be knocked through stamina costs, damage, or other methods. They cannot die and their souls cannot be touched, damaged or hurt through any method. In addition they fast heal for 3 at the start of their turns."
passive,Cosmo,Mustistage Jettison,,1,"As Cosmo uses up his stamina in a battle, he reduces his overall mass to power himself up. Upon reaching half of his max stamina, an epithet engine is expelled out of his body. This increases his damage by 2 and his movement by 3, and allows him to utilize the engine in his abilities by paying 1 stamina. Upon reaching ⅙ of his health, his damage is increased by 4 and his movement by 6, and he gains a second engine to utilize. Each engine can be used once per round. Healing Cosmo does not revert forms gained from this Passive."
passive,Cosmo,Stardust Crusaders,,2,"A voyage to the stars isn’t complete without a crew. At the start of combat, Cosmo summons two Stardust Crusaders: Epithet energy funneled into the form of astronaut suits. They each have 11 stamina, a 5 damage Moonsault melee attack, a 3 damage 4 range Moonblast, and can use one of Cosmo’s abilities, which Cosmo can choose for each upon their summoning. Both cannot have the same ability, and the cost of all abilities are increased by 1. Similarly, they and Cosmo all share Blast Off Supernova’s Once per Combat usage. If the Stardust Crusaders are adjacent to Cosmo as he moves, they can hitch a ride and move along with him. Finally, while adjacent to Cosmo, they can use a full turn to try and heal Cosmo for 3-5 stamina."
ability,Cosmo,Reach For The Stars,X,0,"Cosmo points up towards the sky, calling upon the power of the stars. He can choose a constellation and produce an effect based on it, with stamina cost dependent on the severity. Engine Variant - This augments Cosmo’s basic weapons upon use of the ability, adding a secondary effect based on the constellation to the next successful use of one of them."
ability,Cosmo,Blast Off Supernova,3⛯,1,"With a snap, Cosmo produces a 3x3 rocket in an area of his choice. It immediately prepares for lift off, rumbling in its place. Anyone the rocket spawns on takes 3 damage immediately, and is shunted to the edge of its area. Upon summoning, and at the start of each unit’s turn, all enemies standing adjacent to the rocket take 1 damage. The rocket then gives Cosmo a bonus to his rolls, starting at +3 and being reduced by one until three rounds have passed. At this point, the rocket lifts off, dealing 5 damage to anyone adjacent to it and zooming into the sky. From this point, a 5x5 area of Cosmo’s choice is shrouded in shadow as the rocket crashes down and deals 30 damage to anyone standing inside. It is fairly difficult to avoid/block this crash landing once it has been initiated. Only one rocket can be on the field at a time. Once per Combat, unless the rocket is destroyed before it lifts off. Engine Variant - The engine causes the rocket to become multi staged. Upon it crashing onto the arena, the arena suffers 3 rounds of flaming debris rain that enemies must roll a check to avoid. This completely uses up the engine."
ability,Cosmo,Ionic Wasteland,3,0,"Cosmo funnels his hands together before sending out a massive, pressurized blast. This takes up a 5x3 space line, deals 5-7 damage to everyone it hits, propels Cosmo up to 3 spaces backward, and transforms the afflicted area into an Irradiated Zone. This zone deals 2 damage (to enemies) upon entry, and at the start of an enemy’s turn inside of it, with the latter instance having a chance of afflicting them with an irradiated status, increasing the stamina cost of all of their abilities by 1 for a round. Engine Variant - Using an engine bolsters Cosmo’s power, allowing him to take up to 6 spaces of movement after using this ability. Along with this, Irradiated Zones now always inflict the Irradiated status at the start of an enemy’s turns inside of them, and have a chance of inflicting a stack upon an enemy’s entry into them."
ability,Cosmo,Full Throttle Blitz,1!,1,"Cosmo’s feet expel a large amount of smoke as a cone of fire envelops his body. He can dash up to 3 spaces up to 3 times, and deals 1 fire damage each time he dashes into/through someone. Rolling a 15 or higher inflicts a hit target with a burn status. Once per round. Engine Variant - If Cosmo utilizes his engine, his dashes instead become a single, powerful strike. Doing so allows him to dash up to 6 spaces forward, causes 5-6 damage on contact, and also causes all hit units to be knocked prone. Along with the typical effects of being prone, this also allows Cosmo or an adjacent ally to perform a follow-up attack on the affected unit at reduced effectiveness."
ability,Cosmo,Sputnik Satellaview,3,0,"Out from Cosmo’s body come 1-3 satellites placed in spaces of his choice within 5 spaces of him. These satellites have 6 stamina and a 2 damage 2 range projectile laser that automatically fires upon any enemies that come in range of them. If Cosmo or an ally targets one of the satellites with one of their attacks, all damage that they would have taken is instead transferred into their next laser blast. After using this ability, it cannot be used again until all satellites created from the previous use are destroyed. Engine Variant - Cosmo gives one of the satellites an engine, giving it 4 movement that can be used either on Cosmo’s turn and/or as a 1 stamina, once per round anytime action."
ability,Cosmo,"To The Moon, Your Highness",2,0,"Using this ability is a Swift Action. A glint shines off of Cosmo’s eyes as his right arm begins glowing an incredibly bright orange-white. He then dashes up to 3 spaces in any direction before delivering a massive inferno of an uppercut to an adjacent unit. This deals 3 damage, knocks them skyward, and, if Cosmo wants, he can choose to travel with the unit up into the air. Engine Variant - Upon using an engine, this ability’s uppercut now produces star-like sparks in a 3x3 area centered on Cosmo. As a 1 cost anytime action, Cosmo can have these sparks explode, dealing 3-4 damage and inflicting high knockback."
ability,Cosmo,Hubble Bubble,0!,0,"Cosmo snaps, as a flare of energy produced by his Epithet flies into/as close to space as possible. Upon reaching its destination, the flare expands into a massive, satellite-telescope structure that locks its sights down onto the combat arena. Cosmo can designate a 3x3 area of his choice, and after doing so, the telescope absorbs the energy of all units/ongoing effects in said area. Whenever an action or effect occurs within the area, said action/effect is stored within the telescope’s databanks. Then, as a Bonus Action on his turn, Cosmo can choose to have the telescope transfer its data to him as it goes offline. At this point, Cosmo can create a new ability combining aspects of all of the things that were observed, and he keeps this ability for the rest of combat. The stamina costs for these abilities are typically fairly high, and often dependent on the actions/effects being incorporated. After all of this occurs, Hubble Bubble has a 1-2 round cooldown before being able to be used again. Engine Variant - The area created by Hubble Bubble is now a 4x4, and always has only a 1 round cooldown. Along with this, upon activation, Cosmo can choose one action that has occurred within the last round to immediately add to the telescope’s databanks."
weapon,Ifuku,Glorious Nippon Steel,,0,"7 damage 1 range. Nothing like the classics. Due to the fact that Ifuku only has one arm to guide her blade, and thus her attacking trajectories are more limited, dodge anytimes have a +3 against this attack. However, that’s only for the first time they dodge, as Ifuku gauges their reaction speed."
talent,Ifuku,Another Brush With Death,,0,"Seeing as how being terribly wounded is how Ifuku unlocked incredible power, it happening again is really cooking with gas. Whenever she would end combat with one fourth or lower her Max Stamina, you gain 3 Proficiency and gain another round of your left eye being open (as per Third Eye Open) per combat."
talent,Ifuku,Wandering Samurai,,0,Ifuku gains +1 Movement Speed.
talent,Ifuku,Counter Focused Strategy,,0,"If Ifuku makes a counterattack (either by holding her Main Action to attack when you would be damaged or via some other means), she is treated as rolling a minimum 7 on her attack roll and deals +2 damage. Critical Hits dealt via counter-attacks grant +1 more Proficiency than normal. Any defenses she would’ve used must still be rolled as normal since that’s not the focus of the Miru Style. If she takes no damage from an attack she is countering due to outside “help”, this talent is irrelevant."
passive,Ifuku,Third Eye Blind,,0,"During her close encounter with death, in which she lost her arm, Ifuku’s spirit awakened to its true potential. Her body, however, hasn’t caught up. So instead of enhancing her physicality directly, Ifuku’s spiritual energies influence the next best thing: her clothes. Ifuku’s clothes are connected to her Mindscape, allowing her to store physical things within it as “concepts” which she can then withdraw as a Free Action on her turn. As long as she could fit it into her clothes, there is no limit to what she can fit within it. Now, given, you might need to strip for a bit to fit larger things with a larger surface area, but still. If, for whatever reason, Ifuku isn’t wearing her normal clothes, she must take a Main Action to connect what she is currently wearing to her Mindscape. However, she will not be able to access the things she had stored in your kimono unless expressly stated from an ability."
ability,Ifuku,Needs More Gunpowder,X,0,"Ifuku may withdraw any kind of weapon from within the folds of her clothing as a Free Action with the cost being depending on the range and damage she’s going for. She can only have one of these weapons out at a time, because you know, she can only hold one thing at a time and this shit’s too expensive to just hand out."
ability,Ifuku,Third Eye Open,1,1,"By taking off her eyepatch, Ifuku can reveal her psychokinetic awakening with a brilliant, burning red energy flowing from her scarred retina. Ifuku chooses one living target that she can see. While this eye is open, she deals an additional 2 damage to them and has a +3 on rolls against them. Obstructions/illusions do not inhibit this effect. Maintaining this effect has Upkeep 1, and it has a maximum of 5 Rounds that it can be active per combat. These rounds do not need to be consecutive or against the same target. Bonus Action. (Prof 27) The Eye of Death - By expending an additional round of her “per combat” limit of Third Eye Open (either when activating it or paying upkeep), Ifuku can increase its buff by +2 more damage or increase her critical threat range by one. She can stack this effect twice per instance of a round."
ability,Ifuku,Psycho-Barrier,1!,1,"Since most of Ifuku’s power resides in her clothes, projecting a layer of energy similar to clothing is fairly easy and useful for reducing damage. Generally reduces by 6 on a high success, and is doubly effective at blocking bludgeoning/psychic damage. Once per Round."
ability,Ifuku,Conceptual Overlay,2,0,"Whenever Ifuku would withdraw something from her Mindscape, she may give the item being taken out additional properties based on anything else she currently have stored within her clothes. However, this only applies while Ifuku is holding onto it, and she cannot use the other item until the first is put back inside. If the item is broken the conceptual second is lost forever. This ability is unrolled, unless it would be applied to another ability, in which case it uses the same roll. It must be declared that she’s using this before rolling in such a case. A Proficiency granting 20 grants +1 Proficiency, as opposed to counting as ‘a prof granting crit twice’. Free Action."
weapon,Magano,NXTGeneration,,0,"4 damage 1 range. Magano’s sword, modeled after the katana “Big Bang”, is a long and thin single edged katana. The hilt is black with hints of green, and the blade is all green with hints of black. As her sword is actually a part of her body she doesn’t necessarily need to use her hands to swing it, it can be from any part of her body. Magano can spend 1 stamina while swinging it to reduce the damage to 2 while allowing it to be swung in a three space wide cleave arc."
weapon,Magano,Green Flame Assault,,1,Magano punches someone with such force that flames wrap around them. These flames purify and actually heal the target for 4 stamina at 1 range. (Prof 20) Phoenixian Flame - Green Flame Assault now ‘inflicts’ 1d3 Fast Healing for 3 rounds on rolls of 14+. This is not generally considered a negative status effect and therefore does not grant units a resist roll.
talent,Magano,More Monstrous Than A Dream Should Be,,1,"Magano is able to stretch and reform her body in various ways, much like a certain shounen protag who has the properties of both rubber and pirate. She can extend her limbs up to 3 extra spaces, or 6 extra spaces if she spends 1 stamina for each extra space extended. Stretching her limbs allows her to be adjacent to a target from a distance. She also gains the ability to temporarily expand herself to a 3x3 size for an instant, reflecting any blunt attack or blunt projectile back at the attacker as a once per round 1 cost anytime."
talent,Magano,131.1 The Fear,,0,Magano’s always listening to her favorite radio station and this zen allows her to ride on walls and over gaps with her “rollerblades''. They look so stylish and cool and they also grant her an extra 2 Movement.
passive,Magano,Anomalous Healer,,0,"Magano is an odd case. Despite all of her combat capabilities, she’s actually an exceptional healer. For reasons unbeknownst to anyone but herself, whenever Magano deals damage, all of it is converted to healing and conversely all of her healing is converted to damage. This means that her damage can only be reduced or increased by affecting her healing and vice versa."
passive,Magano,Nightmare Eater,,1,"Magano is able to passively sense people’s fears and anxieties through their nightmares. And although she is a good person(?) deep down, she sure does love the taste of nightmares. This does have a benefit however, and as a Bonus Action on her turn Magano can eat the nightmare of an adjacent target. This not only allows her to apply effects to her own kit based on the target’s fears and nightmares for a round, but also removes that fear or nightmare from the target for that round. For allies, this means that they become more clear headed and focused, this allows them to give themselves advantage on a single roll and a +4 to another roll in the next 2 rounds. For enemies, this means they become more reckless and antsy, and this allows Magano and her allies to give that enemy disadvantage on a single roll and also to make it so that a single one of their attacks (Magano and her ally’s choice) deals half the damage they dealt back to them in the next 2 rounds. This passive can not be used on the same target for 2 rounds after it has been used once. [DYLAXAPHI] Dark Evolution: Dream Sustenance - Consuming nightmares, wouldn’t you know it, is quite filling for Living Dreams like Magano. After eating a nightmare, Magano is able to heal from it! Typically, she gains 1 stamina per turn for an amount of turns depending on her roll quality, the contents of the nightmare, and/or GM discretion."
ability,Magano,Nightmare Brigade,2,1,"Magano, with a sword in all three of her hands, slashes in a line up to her movement...and nothing happens...yet. Every unit that was in that line gains a mark. As an anytime action that costs 0 stamina, Magano can figuratively sheathe one of her swords, thereby activating her slash. An activated slash will either deal 5 damage or heal 4 stamina (Magano’s choice). Once Magano activates the third slash, any other marks she left during the initial attack disappear. Don’t worry about that third hand. (Prof 26) The Nightmare Begins - Magano gains a +2 to targeting anyone with a mark on them, advantage on activating one of her marks per round, and she can also eat the nightmare of anyone that has a mark regardless of distance."
ability,Magano,Magano Grind,3,0,"Magano jumps into the air and a grind rail appears under her feet that she starts to grind on. While on this grind rail, she can make a basic attack as a Bonus Action and her movement is increased by 1.5x. The rail is not visibly connected to anything and can go up to 3 spaces in height (it can start that high as well). When it is summoned, up to 15 spaces of it can be placed at a time, but Magano needs to decide where it goes at the time of placing it, and it cannot go through units. If Magano still has rail left to travel and it is not her own turn she keeps moving a single space per turn until she runs out of rail. When Magano runs out of rail, she can spend 2 stamina to extend the rail another 10 spaces. The rail only lasts for 1 round after being placed or until Magano reaches the end of a set of placed rails. (Prof 18) The World Is My Grindspace - So long as there is a solid enough surface for it to be attached to, Magano can create rails up to the height of that surface, but the total she can place is reduced by a third rounded to her benefit. This cannot be used on ceilings and she must be within the range of her initial ability usage."
ability,Magano,Sound Sleep Tagging,1,1,"Magano rides up on her rollerblades, and with her sword starts to tag an adjacent target like she’s painting graffiti. This works surprisingly better than you might expect it to work considering she’s using a sword. This heals the target for 5 stamina, and, depending on what Magano decides to tag them with, also produces a simple extra effect that now affects that target. This not only rolls with advantage on those previously affected by her Nightmare Eater passive this combat, but is also considered a basic attack."
weapon,Retnue,Spool Hammer,,0,"7 damage 1 range. A large spool of thermally conductive chain-string acts as the head of this modified hammer.  The thread of this spool can get caught on anything Retnue swings the spool at.  The spool has 60ft of thread to work with. The chain-string can be used as its own weapon. (Prof 42) Bonk - Retnue can throw down the head of his hammer to get +1 extra movement, while the head becomes frozen over as a miniature glacier. The Spool Hammer basic attack cannot be used when this is active, and Retnue’s string is constantly attached to The Icicle Crash."
weapon,Retnue,The Icicle Crash,,0,"5 damage 2 range. While Retnue's Spool Hammer is very effective, you can never go wrong with the classic beam sword. Flipping the hammer around reveals its handle to be a beam-lance that constantly emits a blue light. The Icicle Crash can pass through all forms of DR. It has the chance to partially freeze enemies on rolls of 15+."
weapon,Retnue,Snowflake Shot,,0,"2 range 4 damage. Retnue holds the Icicle Crash up high, as a storm of blue energy orbs begin swirling around it. In an instant, he can fire them off at an enemy of his choice as a Bonus Action."
talent,Retnue,Contract List,,0,Retnue has access to constant updates on the names and a vague description of the abilities of bounties within the immediate area.
talent,Retnue,Living On The Edge,,0,"It took many years, but finally Retnue has reached peak edge, rendering him immune to emotion based effects."
passive,Retnue,Frozen Over,,1,"Retnue can either spend 3 stamina as a Bonus Action, or use his Movement Action to activate Frozen Over. Once he does, his posture loosens as he opens his mouth, allowing a cloud of frozen air to begin pouring out. This cloud envelopes Retnue’s body as he is coated by an invisible layer of ice, which stays on Retnue until he takes 10 or more damage post activating it. While this coat is on him, he is able to perfectly morph and manipulate the coat as he pleases, using it as modifiers on his actions that he can choose to roll separately or along with the base action. Along with this, he can use the coat to turn invisible, and he can spend his entire Movement Action to expend the coat, instead creating a 5x5 glacier in an area of his choice that shatters at the end of his next turn"
passive,Retnue,Black Ice,,1,"Once per Combat, Retnue may use a “Black Ice” Version of any of his abilities. The Black Ice Version must be called before being rolled."
passive,Retnue,Nuclear Winter,,0,"Cold spreads like an ever-expanding blanket. Whenever Retnue performs an attacking Main Action, Retnue can pay an additional 3 Stamina to cause either a 3x3 area including him or the area the attack occurred within/over to be overtaken by a sheet of ice. These areas, emanating a withering energy, continuously drain the heat and lifeforce of enemies standing within them, dealing 1 damage to them on entry and at the start of their turns, which increases by 1 every two times they have been affected by this within a combat (maximum 3). Along with this, the areas count as difficult terrain for enemies and decrease their rolls by 2, while having the inverse effects for Retnue. The roll modifiers are non-stacking with other roll modifiers. If an enemy unit ends their turn in one of these areas, their body is partially frozen over, cutting their next Movement Action’s range in half and inflicting the effects of Flash Freeze’s “Cold Stasis” until they leave the area. The effects of this Passive bypass ice resistances and immunities."
passive,Mera Mera No Mi,Flame Body,,2,"As Retnue’s body is made of fire, he naturally avoids most attacks. Any attack that deals 5 or less damage simply misses him by passing through his flame body. He is also immune to fire damage unless the source is significantly hotter than regular fire. Also, whenever he makes physical contact with someone they take 2 damage."
ability,Retnue,Fash Freeze,2!,1,"Retnue flash freezes something he touches for 1 round. If he targets his thread, then it will freeze beyond the thread itself, spurring forth fragmenting spikes of ice dealing 4 damage to enemies in contact with it. Once per Round. Black Ice - Retnue can selectively freeze anything/everything adjacent to him. Any empty spaces that are frozen over are difficult to walk over without slipping. As a 1 cost Bonus Action on his turn, he may turn these spaces into miniature glaciers that he can move telepathically. (Prof 57) Cold Stasis - Flash Freeze’s 1 Round of Effectiveness is now a minimum instead of a maximum. Along with this, if a unit is frozen, at the start of their turn they take 1d3-1 (minimum 1) damage, all timer based effects (such as charges, usage recharges, etc) are delayed variably, and while they remain frozen, they cannot be healed."
ability,Retnue,Crystal Copy,2!,1,"Retnue creates an ice double of himself.  This can be used in a range of 2 spaces and can block attacks. Once per round. Black Ice - Black Ice Crystal Copies are a fair bit tougher, can have up to 2 summoned at once, and melt in 2 rounds instead of one. When melted, they leave a 1x1 puddle that deals 2 damage. (Prof 25) Crystal Killshot - If a Crystal Copy of Retnue's survives, he can control it on his next turn. It has a 4 damage ice-based sabre attack, but otherwise can't do much without Retnue manipulating it. After it has one turn of life, it tragically melts unless something really big happens. Like it being created on a critical success, or it gets sentience, or something equally cool/weird. (Prof 35) Ice Sculptures - A Crystal Copy, as soon as it's summoned, can use a 1 or 2 cost ability (other than Crystal Copy) at instant speed, or simply attack. Using something with a Crystal Copy does not use up its once per round limitation."
ability,Retnue,Figure Skating Flurry,3,0,"With the elegance and refined nature expected from Retnue, he dashes forward while producing ice-tiles on the ground he moves across. The dash can go a maximum of 3 spaces, and at the end of it, Retnue performs a swift attack with The Icicle Crash. If this attack lands, he can follow up with another dash and a stronger attack. This continues until he misses or until the GM says so. If used more than thrice, it cannot be used again for the rest of combat. Black Ice - This is usable no matter how many times Figure Skating Flurry has been used prior. (Prof 52) Relentless Storm - Figure Skating Flurry can now be used thrice in a chain before losing its usage (increased from 2 times). The Icicle Crash also gains cleaving properties when using this ability. Along with this, if Retnue fails one of the initial three attacks made with Figure Skating Flurry, he can still attempt to make the others. Only failing after the first three locks him out from going for additional attacks. In this case, the increased damage from consecutive attacks from Figure Skating Flurry only applies if the previous attack successfully hit."
ability,Retnue,Glacial Skate,3⛯,0,"Coalescing his powers, Retnue creates a large 3x3 Ice Platform in front of him. After it's fully formed, Retnue winds back his hammer and slams into it, sending it careening around the arena like a hockey puck, dealing damage to everyone and everything it may run into. Retnue can choose to hop on the platform as well, allies can choose to do the same if it passes over them, while mooks would only be flattened and boss characters would need to roll. Anyone can interact with this ice sheet and send it flying at enemies, including the enemies themselves. While how long it lasts depends on the roll and environment, it usually lasts 3-4 rounds. Once per Combat. Black Ice - The platform may be either 2x2 or 4x4, deals slightly more damage, and gets everywhere it goes coated in a thin layer of ice. Retnue, while walking on this ice, can move 2 spaces while only taking one space of his movement action."
ability,Mera Mera No Mi,Fire Fist,4,1,"Retnue punches forwards as his fist becomes a massive travelling fireball. This causes a 3x10 area in front of him in a single cardinal direction (long end facing forwards) which deals 8 damage to everyone within. On a 16 or higher this inflicts a burn status, which deals 1d4 damage at the start of their turns and can be staved off with a roll."
ability,Mera Mera No Mi,Saint Elmo's Fire,X,0,"X is capped at 3. Retnue creates X lances made up of flame, which travel up to 8 spaces and pierce targets for 4 damage each. Notably, the fire lances pierce through most defenses like DR."
weapon,Viktor,Cane of Whimsey,,0,4 damage 1 range. A bedazzled cane with a color scheme that makes it resemble a stereotypical black-and-white magician’s wand.
weapon,Viktor,Flare Gun,,0,"1 damage 3 range. By removing a cap at the end of his cane, Viktor can reveal a miniature flare gun nestled inside! On higher end rolls, it can inflict a 1d4 burn status. (Prof 46) Flare of Flair and Fanfare - Viktor’s Flare Gun gains +1 damage (1 to 2)."
talent,Viktor,Escape Artist,,0,"Whenever Viktor is trapped, he can pull a Houdini and simply get out of it by using a move action"
talent,Viktor,This is MY Time Slot,,0,Viktor deals more damage against other magicians.
talent,Viktor,Eternal Suffering,,0,Viktor is immune to emotional damage due to desensitization.
passive,Viktor,Entertainer at Heart,,0,"As Viktor does more and more tricks, the more successful they are, the more the audience goes wild. This gives Viktor “Glamour Points” that he can expend to make a roll more potent. However, if his tricks fail spectacularly, and the audience is unimpressed, he can lose Glamour Points. Having this happen when he’s at zero Glamour Points does actual damage to him. 1 Glamour Point has a conversion rate to 2 for a roll. (Prof 40) Break a Leg - Every time Viktor fails a roll while having no Glamour Points, the enemies begin to pity him more and more, dealing 1 emotional damage back to them."
passive,Viktor,Tough Crowd,,0,"Once Viktor’s started to eat enough shit by failing a few rolls in enough of a succession, the metaphysical crowd will start jeering him and throwing tomatoes onto the stage. This means that everyone, on their turn, has to roll to avoid getting pelted by them. If someone is hit, the tomatoes will reduce their rolls slightly. The tomato storm stops once Viktor starts succeeding."
passive,Viktor,Be Amazed,,1,"Viktor's act seems to have an almost bewitching and captivating effect thanks to his epithet (cuz it sure doesn't without it). Whenever Viktor successfully performs any main action that involves some kind of circus act, all enemies within 3 range of him gain the Dazzled status for the next 4 turns on turn order. Dazzled characters can't use anytimes and have halved movement. Viktor also gains +1 Glamour points for each target he inflicts with Dazzled, with this passive or otherwise."
ability,Viktor,Thank You For Volunteering,3⛯!,1,"In a flash, Viktor grabs a unit that is attacking him or an adjacent ally and makes them an involuntary volunteer in a dazzling trick of grand proportions. Depending on the trick Viktor decides to do, the effects and/or damage of the ability may vary. Once per combat. (Prof 74) An Act of Grand Proportions - Using May I Have a Volunteer on a Dazzled target does not use its once per combat charge."
ability,Viktor,The Art of Distraction,1!,1,"Viktor can allow an ally to reroll a given action by performing a trick that grabs the attention of everyone in the arena. This gives the ally enough time to try again. Once per round. (Prof 34) Say Thank You To My Assistant - Whenever you help someone out with The Art of Distraction, Viktor can pass off the teammate’s move suddenly succeeding while no one was looking as if done by magic! This means he gets Glamour Points from both your roll on the ability AND your teammate’s new roll, and he doesn't lose Glamour Points if the teammate fucks up their second roll either."
ability,Viktor,The Show Goes On,1,1,"Viktor continues his show by performing a trick. He rolls a d20 like any other ability to see if it’s successful, and if it is, he rolls a d10 to determine what trick he does. If no acceptable targets are within range for a specific trick, then Viktor can hold off on performing said trick until he is within range. However, he can not have more than one trick saved at once. Viktor’s Trick List https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNElqWojeYlJX1yPHwYRM1WHfONXePJ-fSGb3roR5v4/edit?usp=sharing  (Prof 14) Wow! Even Better Tricks? - Viktor can upgrade one of his tricks to a brand spanking new version! (Used on Trick 3) (Prof 20) More Tricks Up These Sleeves! - An upgrade to that garbage “ability” Viktor calls The Show Goes On to make it actually good! He no longer has a limit to how many tricks he can have stored. When Viktor uses this ability, instead of rolling to see if he gets a stored trick he instead automatically gets one regardless of his roll. Instead, if he succeeds the roll he gets another trick stored and gets to roll again to store even more! If he fails a roll, he stops adding tricks. Each of these rolls can generate Glamour Points. When he successfully gets a stored trick beyond the first he can choose to stop rolling and use the trick he got on a target within range immediately with that roll from before. (Prof 36) Wow! Even Better Tricks? 2 - Viktor can upgrade one of his tricks to a brand spanking new version...again! (Used on Trick 4) (Prof 38) Tricks! Anytime, Anywhere! - Viktor can now use tricks gained from The Show Goes On as once per round bonus actions on his turn, so he can use one a turn without using his main action, or use two in one turn. (Prof 50) Fuck I Should Have Made These Earlier - Viktor adds the last two tricks I should have made earlier to his The Show Must Go On trick list. (Prof 64) Wow! Even Better Tricks? 3 - Choose another three of Viktor’s tricks, and they get upgraded to a new version from the boosted trick list! Reminder that he can’t upgrade a trick that’s already been upgraded. He also doesn’t have upgrades for his 10 new tricks. (Used on Trick 1, 5, and 7)"
ability,Viktor,Disappearing Act,2!,1,"Viktor can willingly vanish into a puff of smoke and appear up to 9 spaces away, dodging an attack in the process! Once per round (Prof 42) Exit Stage Anywhere - Disappearing Act’s movement range is increased from 6 to 9 spaces."
ability,Viktor,The Ol' Razzle-Dazzle,1,1,"You can spend Glamour Points as a Bonus Action on your turn to make an item or person’s outfit more sparkly and glamorous. This applies a less potent but lasting boost to the user/wearer’s rolls, more specifically a 1 to +1 ratio between Glamour Points spent and bonuses to their rolls. The boosts last until the end of combat (or longer if they are used towards the end) and you can put any amount of them you want into one boost. Glamorousness can also be done in specific designs like ribbons or glitter or rhinestones to try and RP other effects."
ability,Viktor,My Beautiful Assistants,5!,1,"Around Viktor, 2-4 glittery assistant constructs appear to help him with whatever act he’s putting on at the time! These assistants can each take an action to either assist with any move to increase its roll by +3 each, or alternatively they can work just like Viktor to do whatever action he is currently doing at halved effectiveness on their own! They each roll for this separately. After they perform an action, Viktor must pay 2 stamina each to keep an assistant around afterwards, otherwise they deconstitute. They have 5 stamina and 5 movement each, and Viktor cannot have more than 4 on the field (unless his Outclass is active). Once per Round."
ability,Viktor,The Show-Stopper!,3⛯,0,"Viktor pulls out the ultimate closer to a packed showing: The Show-Stopper! It’s a MASSIVE fuck you cannon, a 5x11 construct which fires out one of its ends for a 5xInfinite line attack which deals a CHUNKY 16 damage to anyone within, friend or foe. Afterwards, The Show-Stopper dissolves into glitter. The cannon can be created anywhere on the map facing any direction. Using this move can only be shared for special occasions. As such, Viktor can only use it during the final phase of the final combat of a session. The fight also has to be worthy of the showing, with rewards within the 4 proficiency range or above for rewards. Once per Combat."
weapon,Beetlebob,Spiderwing Bat,,0,"A baseball with a cool bat wing decal, and also legs for some reason?"
talent,Beetlebob,"Thrills, Chills, Kills!",,0,"As an announcer, it’s your job to make exhilarating commentary! The more announcer-y and showtunes-y Beetlebob acts, the less reality starts to function around him, giving him actual cartoon physics in real life! Or, in mechanical terms, use an announcer voice to use cartoon logic on your actions!"
passive,Beetlebob,Holistic Baseball,,1,"Okay okay, so the last gimmick didn’t actually work. But THIS TIME it’ll be pretty great! Come up with some random fucking gimmick like boxing gloves or hurdles or magma rain at the start of every combat. Enemies gain a +3 in using these gimmicks, but only when trying to kill each other! Isn’t this fun? (Prof 16) Sponsorship Deal - THIS MURDER WAS SPONSORED BY… well, whatever Beetlebob chooses. At some point during the combat, he may choose something to “sponsor” this game of Holistic Baseball. Things relating to that sponsorship become… weirdly present and likely, in a way that’s hard to describe."
ability,Beetlebob,Little Lethal,1,0,"Beetlebob throws out a baseball made of an incredibly… kinetic material. Roll to hit someone. However, that person can then roll to knock it away and have it hit another person instead, and that person can do the same, on and on until someone rolls a 5 or less. Deals 3 damage initially, but for every reflection it deals +1 damage due to it gaining speed. The ball can also be ricochet or hit into objects for alternative effects like knockback. Range of 10."
ability,Beetlebob,Glorious Hitter,3,0,"Beetlebob might be mostly an announcer, but he’s got a little game himself! For each enemy in a baseball diamond shape (bases are 3 spaces to diagonal up right, then 3 up left, then 3 down left, then down right 3) dash through, dealing 5 damage to the enemies he dashes through on the way to the bases and knocking them out of the way, and 8 damage to those on the bases plus hitting them with his baseball bat, punting them in any direction you want! Has a 3 round cooldown though."
ability,Beetlebob,They Put Bugs In 'Em,1,0,"Literally just disintegrate into bugs. While Beetlebob’s a bunch of bugs enemies roll disadvantage to attack him, he can climb on people to deal a continuous 4 damage without an action on their turn, fit into small spaces, and most importantly: spread out across the arena to perform combo techs with all his little bug parts working in tandem doing stuff! They can even limitedly control electricity and fire. Beetlebob can reform into his “humanoid form” as a bonus action on his turn."
weapon,Pyrite,The Sickle Cell Sickle,,0,"This is what Pyrite calls this attack, but in reality, he just scratches you in the face."
weapon,Pyrite,MY BLOOOOOOOOD,,0,"Pyrite flings some of his blood out at an opponent, hardening it while it flies through the air. It acts as a 2x1 projectile, and is just barely under the threshold for Pyrite taking damage for using it. The blood is left on the space the hit target(s) are standing on. (Prof 12) Blood Transfusion - If Pyrite somehow manages to strike an open wound with MY BLOOOOOOOOD, his funky multi-type blood is rejected by the target. This causes them to take 2 extra damage and 1 more damage at the start of their next turn. This technically applies to all of Pyrite’s blood based attacks (which is pretty much all of them), but it is most effective with MY BLOOOOOOOOD."
talent,Pyrite,Blood Type Tyrant,,0,"Pyrite’s Epithet makes it so his blood essentially acts as all types at once. Therefore, he is neither a universal donor nor a universal receiver."
passive,Pyrite,Roaring Riptide,,1,"Just about everything Pyrite does involves him sloshing his own blood around. Due to his Epithet, this is potent, and Pyrite can elect to spend extra stamina or max stamina on any of his actions to make them more effective and/or deal more damage. If he does this, the action also leaves 1 more blood puddle on the ground more than it usually does. However, if he uses max stamina, he can also get a blood-related followup after the action. After spending max stamina, he does not regain until the end of the session. He can also absorb blood adjacent to him to heal as a main action. [DYLAXAPHI - DARK EVOLUTION] Magne-Iron - Pyrite’s blood, through Shadowrealm influence, has been made to be magnetic! With this property, not only can he attract metal into it, but he can also regain 1d2 Max Stamina lost from Roaring Riptide at the start of his turn."
passive,Pyrite,Nasty Crash Protection,,0,"Once per Combat, after Pyrite is hit by an attack, he can choose to have the wound created from it (technically creating an open gash if the attack would not usually give him one) suddenly be overtaken by a massive, coagulated blood clot. Once it is fully bloated, it explodes, sending a glob of Pyrite’s blood to the person who hit him that deals half the damage Pyrite took +1d3. Pyrite can choose to have a blood puddle produced either adjacent to him or the person hit. From here, the wound this was produced from becomes covered in a scab, and Pyrite heals for 1 stamina at the start of every other turn until he has healed for half or more of the original attack, determined by rolling 1dX (X = damage dealt to Pyrite) (minimum of half of original damage)."
ability,Pyrite,Hang Five,1!,1,"Pyrite pulls out his surfboard and produces a bubble of blood that bursts and releases a red wave that Pyrite can ride. The wave can travel in any direction anywhere from 3-7 spaces, and anything that gets picked up by the wave is dragged with Pyrite and takes 1 damage each space they travel. If there are blood puddles on the ground, all of them also become waves that can be moved independently of Pyrite. Once per Round. (Prof 17) GNARLY!!! - If Pyrite leads waves other than one he is riding into HIS wave, he gets an extra +2 movement for each."
ability,Pyrite,The Blood House,3⛯,1,"Pyrite clenches his fist as a pool of blood congeals around a chosen target’s feet. It then shoots up and traps them within a blood clot, encasing them within and holding them in place. While in “The Blood House”, a trapped unit cannot move or use any action that requires that they move their body more than very slightly, and they take 1 damage at the start of their turns. To break out, they must roll a check higher than Pyrite’s initial roll to trap them, and they can use both their movement action and their main action to attempt this. Each round they are trapped inside, the DC is reduced by three. If used on himself, Pyrite does not suffer the negative effects of being in The Blood House, and can shatter it at will. Once per Combat."
ability,Pyrite,Clot Kaboom,3,0,"With a scream, Pyrite causes a nearby buildup of blood to explode violently. This activates as a 5x5 blast with him at its center, and also causes all blood puddles on the field to produce a 3x3 explosion. Regardless of which version hits someone it deals 3-5 damage per explosion."
ability,Pyrite,SHARK IN THE WATER,3,1,"With a stupid laugh, Pyrite performs an underhand swing that transitions into a skyward shaka. Doing this produces a wave of blood that travels across the ground, morphing into an iconic shark fin. It travels up to 4 spaces in a direction, dealing 4-5 damage to each enemy hit, before then circling a 4x4 area including the last space it traveled into. Only two sharks can be present on the field at once, and sharks can be attacked to try and remove them. As a once per turn, 1 cost anytime, Pyrite can have a shark jump up into the air, attacking a unit in the 4x4 with a vicious bite. This deals 5-6 damage, and Pyrite can have the shark send a hit unit flying in a direction of his choice. If he wants, he can have this shark target himself or an ally to give them a movement boostie. Each unit in combat can only be targeted once per round, and for each activation within a round, the anytime has its cost increased by one."
weapon,Raphael,Letter Opener,,0,4 damage 1 range. A switchblade that looks like a letter opener. It’s not. It’s a switchblade. But I suppose it could be used as a letter opener. A tool of many crafts.
talent,Raphael,Squeakums,,0,"Raphael has a pet rat. They have 5 Stamina and deal 3 damage at melee with 7 Movement. He’s very good at wielding human weaponry for some reason and can of course chew through anything with less strength than steel. (Prof 18) Ratcatcher - While Squeakums is on Raphael’s person, he does not trigger attacks of opportunity nor traps. Squeakums receives +1 Movement (6 to 7)."
passive,Raphael,Every Frame A Painting,,0,"Raphael can freely travel into art, whether it be sculptures, paintings, pictures, movies, anything that Raphael would consider to be art. From there, he can interact with things within the art, even pulling them out into the real world. He can hide within art to avoid detection, or even move from one art piece to another one nearby."
ability,Raphael,First Editions,1,0,"Raphael’s contractors generally give him some pretty good forgeries of famous art pieces, to replace the originals when he snags them. He can pull out any real (or made up) painting and set it down somewhere, or hold it, or hang it up, or whatever. Raphael can immediately use Every Frame A Painting on it the turn he summons it."
ability,Raphael,Night At The Museum,2,0,Cause any set of drawings or sculptures to animate and pop out of the pictures if applicable! This lets Raphael turn them into minions that fight for him.
ability,Raphael,Blank Canvas,3⛯,0,"Raphael pulls out a blank canvas and paints on it. Starting immediately, Raphael will list what he adds to the painting and the desired effect to go with it at the start of each of his turns. In three turns, he’ll have listed three effects, and the work will be done. From there, Raphael can both use this canvas with his other abilities, as well as gain a new ability that causes all three painted effects to happen! Once per Combat."
ability,Raphael,Impressionist Viewpoint,1,0,"Oftentimes something that emulates our conception of a thing is better than the real thing itself. With this ability, Raphael may pull out an item no bigger than what can fit in a 20” by 24“ by 20“ cubic area. It is constructed of impressionist brush strokes in 3D space. While the item is ineffective for use outside of people’s conception of the object, it has an innate nonstacking +1 to all rolls when it comes to accomplishing its associated purpose and can perform usually impossible tasks adjacent to that (for example, an impressionist sword would be almost useless at blocking, but could cut through even metal materials). This can be used as a Bonus Action Once per Combat, and as a Main Action other times. Raphael can only have one of these active at once and can dispel it at will."
weapon,Saffron,Ornate Fans,,0,"4 damage 3 range. Two sharp throwing fans, one that’s literally made out of $100 bills, and another pink frilly one that not only has a gold lining, but also is “graced” with a portrait of Saffron on it that’s surrounded by a giant red heart."
weapon,Saffron,You Are Beneath Me!,,0,"5 damage 1 range. Saffron stomps down on an adjacent target, dealing 5 damage as they are forced to the ground. If the unit she is using this on is Svelte Build, this deals +1 damage."
talent,Saffron,Absolutely Loaded,,0,Saffron can basically buy anything at any given moment. Her family’s riches know no bounds.
passive,Saffron,Dollhouse Accessory Catalogue,,1,"Saffron, always putting fashion first, is always on top of the newest available articles up for purchase. That, her nigh unlimited money, and her love of style and aesthetics grants her access to 5 separate shopping catalogs full of accessories for her to choose from. At the start of a session, she rolls 1d5 to determine which of her catalogs are currently online and able to be purchased from. Combat Catalogs - On the start of each of Saffron’s turns, she can pick one item from her current catalog to receive at the start of her next turn. Saffron can also choose to forego choosing an item, instead subscribing to another of her catalogs as a free action. Items gained from this Passive are kept after the end of a combat, but if Saffron wants to keep them into start of the next combat, she must spend half of her movement and not get to choose an item on her first turn. She is also restricted to one catalog at the start of a combat, so if she currently has multiple unlocked, she must choose which to keep. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whLNjHLelIY7aISY0ncyuFf2_wp0UQ4mAdrhUm3srow/edit?usp=sharing "
ability,Saffron,Take Care Of It For Me,2!,1,"Saffron pulls out her cell phone and calls up one of her butlers, whom she calls her “Dolls”. Not wanting to get docked any pay, they immediately dart onto the battlefield to perform an action before leaving just as promptly. They can come from any direction/place, regardless of how seemingly illogical it may be. On rolls of 16 or higher, the Doll comes in with whatever item Saffron is currently ordering via her Passive, and she can choose a new one to receive on her next turn. Once per round."
ability,Saffron,Money Makes The World Go Round,3,0,"Saffron doesn’t feel like overexerting herself right now, so instead, someone else can go do something. With a complete lack of care, she tosses a stupid amount of cash at a unit of her choice. If used on an ally, they are paid to take another action. If used on an enemy, she pays them to perform an action of her choice. An enemy’s vulnerability to this ability is dependent on how swayed they are by money. (Prof 19) All Expenses Paid - Saffron sighs, she really really doesn’t feel like it right now. By making this ability a full turn action Saffron can give the target of her choice a move action in addition to the regular action. When targeting an enemy with this version she rolls with advantage, but they do not have the move action. If she rolls an 18+ when doing this, she does not need to make this a full turn action."
ability,Saffron,Chasing Riches,1,0,"Pulling out one of her purses, Saffron whistles as she begins to swing the thing around. This purse is filled to the brim with gold bars, and can hit a unit for 3-4 damage on the initial swing. After the windup, she throws the purse to a space within 4 of her current position. Almost immediately, a swarm of Dolls attempt to swoop in and take this extra pay for themselves. The mob can either take the form of a flash mob that instantly congregates in an area around the purse, or as a “line attack” that can drag objects and units with them."
talent,Yami,Hidden Ability: Prankster,,2,"Yami’s ability now changes to Prankster. Prankster is an ability that allows Yami to use a status move right before an enemy's turn, making any status move an anytime action. When this is used, it has priority over other start of turn effects, including the effects of Yami's own abilities. Once per Round."
passive,Yami,"Wow, You Already Know Type Matchups?",,2,"Hahaha Yami is a bit ""strange"". This means that a number of things are different for her. For starters, her ""typing"" is Ghost/Dark, which means that attacks or abilities that would be considered ""Normal"", ""Fighting"", or ""Psychic"" Type damage do not affect her, and she takes ½ damage from ""Poison"" attacks. These resistances can be easily avoided if the attacker can flavor the ability correctly. Yami is also from ""Generation 5"" so ""Fairy"" based typing and damage just has normal effectiveness against her."
weapon,Bishop,Brains Over Brawn,,0,"Bishop is not one to throw simple punches. Instead, he utilizes his psychic powers either to produce damaging waves of mental energy, or to telekinetically lift and/or slam a chosen target within 6 spaces. The damage dealt from the second variation is dependent on what Bishop chooses to do with the hit target. 4 damage 4 range."
talent,Bishop,Brainiac Barrier,,0,"Seeing as how Bishop’s strength comes from his mental ability, his mind is nigh unbreakable. As such, he is immune to mental effects/damage and, in fact, reflects them back onto the person who attempted to inflict him with it."
ability,Bishop,The Thinking Man,2,0,"With a snap, Bishop conjures a chair that he sits in with one leg crossed over the other. He places his hand onto a chin and begins thinking about some sort of topic. It can be something as broad as “complex math problems” or as specific as “if robots do, in fact, dream of electric sheep, would that imply that they are self aware of their inherent differences from regular sheep?”. Depending on what he chooses to think about, an effect of his choice is constantly emanating as an aura in a chosen 2x2 area. Bishop can have up to two of these areas on the field at once."
ability,Bishop,Mental Shutdown,1!,1,"Bishop’s eyes glow for a brief moment as a target of his choice is dizzied/stunned instantly. If this ability is used as an interrupt, it cancels out an action the target is currently performing. Also, if Bishop rolls a 16 or higher, the target’s next movement is cancelled. Once per round."
weapon,Cardinal,Pure Mass,,0,"Cardinal produces a grey ball of non distinct matter that follows his hand as he moves it. He can then use it as a 5 damage melee weapon while he performs complex, dance-like motions."
talent,Cardinal,The World Is My Toolbox,,0,"Cardinal has a near infinite supply of pocket sized items that he can use for his abilities, but most of the time he does need to roll for more complex items."
ability,Cardinal,Atomic Space Molding,2,0,"Taking an object either on his person or adjacent to him, Cardinal uses his Epithet to rearrange its molecules and reform it either as a 2x2 cube or a 1x6 skewer. Depending on the object that he uses to make the new object, its properties change. If he wants, Cardinal can instead construct the object purely out of non distinct grey matter. In this case, it typically deals around 7-8 damage when used to attack others."
ability,Cardinal,State Shift,1!,1,"Cardinal focuses on a chosen object for a moment before said object suddenly experiences a change in its state of matter. He can either change something to be in a state that it wasn’t before for whatever reason he may desire, or simply enhance the solidity/liquidity/gaseousness of matter already in that state. The quality of his roll determines how long that object remains in that state, and he can also revert something to its original state on command. Once per round."
weapon,Bishardinal,Playing Around,,0,"Bishardinal’s aura flares up as he delivers a series of rapid kicks and/or punches, oftentimes with cocky quotes or extra flair for the hell of it. 6 damage 1 range."
weapon,Bishardinal,Mass Destruction,,0,Bishardinal produces a grey ball of matter with a strange energy coating its surface. He can throw it as a projectile that can explode on contact to cause minor knockback. 5 damage 4 range.
weapon,Bishardinal,Psycho Control,,0,"Crossing his arms, Bishardinal uses his telekinesis to lift a chosen target and contort/throw them as he wishes. Damage is dependent on what exactly it is that he does. This is a Bonus Action."
talent,Bishardinal,Best of Both Worlds,,0,Bishardinal has the Talents of both Bishop and Cardinal.
ability,Bishardinal,Space of The Mastermind,2,0,"Using a combination of the mental and the material, Bishardinal produces any thing/object of his choice. He then either uses it once, able to morph its form in the process, or transforms it into a 3x3 space that imbues effects related to the object."
ability,Bishardinal,Dreams Into Reality,1!,1,"The air surrounding Bishardinal begins to waver as he reaches into a chosen target’s psyche. From there, he takes the target’s perception of a particular form of matter and brings it into the material plane. The target is temporarily suspended in an orb of the substance, which may halt their action and/or inflict other effects dependent on the material. Once per round."
ability,Bishardinal,Plasmic Star Shower,3⛯,1,"Bishardinal’s energy comes to a climax as he uses his mental energy to harness the material and energy of plasma. He then fires this mixture into the sky, resulting in a cosmic wave of meteors falling onto the battlefield. These meteors hit every enemy in a 5x5 area of Bishardinal’s choice dealing 8-11 damage initially. However, if the roll used to activate this ability is 15 or higher, Bishardinal can roll again to send another wave of 3 damage meteors onto each target. Once per Combat. (Prof 32) Torrential Downpour - Plasmic Star Shower’s exploding dice meteor waves now deal 5 damage, and if Bishardinal does not reach the 15+ requirement to initiate the wave(s) on the initial ability roll, he can spend stamina equal to the difference of 15 and the roll’s value to cause the first wave to occur."
weapon,Breeze,Radi-Kick,,0,"Breeze punches and/or kicks a target of his choice. In doing so, knockback may be applied, and Breeze often taunts a little bit after showcasing his sick skills. 4 damage 1 range."
talent,Breeze,"Yo, Yo-Yo!",,0,"Breeze has a cool ass set of yo-yos! Sick! Whenever he is performing an action, he can add the sentence: “Breeze also uses his trusty yo-yos, swinging them to add some extra blunt damage to this action,” onto it. Doing so costs 1 stamina, but he can modify this sentence with One Bad Gloop."
talent,Breeze,Pioneer of Pizzaz,,0,"Breeze is full of surprises, and he always has something up his sleeve! Always. As a free anytime action on his turn, Breeze may stylishly pull a small object out of his sleeve or pocket! Alongside just being used, it can be incorporated with a basic attack or ability to add effects or flavor. (This talent can be affected by One Bad Gloop)."
passive,Breeze,One Bad Gloop,,1,"And she do, in fact, what I yoinky. Breeze is...an interesting young man with an interesting vocabulary. Whenever he uses an action, he can replace any word within said action’s text with one of his personal favorite words. He has a lot of favorites. In non-cheeky speak, these words are gibberish that can be interpreted in many different crazy ways. If he pays 1-2 stamina, he can cause the replaced word to stay that way for the rest of combat."
ability,Breeze,Cool Guy Assault,2,0,"Breeze smirks before bolting forward at incredible speeds. This allows him to run up to his movement in a straight line, and any enemies he dashes through get knocked to the side and take 4-6 damage. However, the last enemy affected by this is special. Breeze performs a stylish flip-kick on them, knocking them up into the air while dealing a solid 6-9 damage. Nice. The hit unit produces a small shockwave when they hit the ground, potentially damaging adjacent units."
ability,Breeze,Radi-Kool Shot,X,0,"With a flourish of his hands, Breeze forms a ball constructed of pure Ki. It crackles with energy while flashing a different color every second. After he is done charging, Breeze fires the ball at a unit within 6 spaces of his current location. As it flies through the air, Breeze can mold its shape, thereby impacting any damage it deals and any extra effects it may impart. Stamina cost is determined by severity."
ability,Breeze,Cool Quickie,1!,1,"Breeze kicks his heels as he begins floating in the air. At this point, he can zoom to any location within 3 spaces, doing a cool pose along the way. While this happens, a rainbow aura surrounds him, and he can phase through solid objects. Once the movement has been taken, Breeze returns to the ground as sparks fly off of him. Once per Round."
weapon,Kuro,Crmson Slash,,1,"Kuro wields the Blade Of Boundaries, a tachi that gleams red as an ocean of blood. 6 damage 1 range. (Prof 17) Blade Honing - +1 damage and range (6 to 7, 1 to 2). - Echo: Double Crimson Slash (0) - The attack is repeated again on the same target, though it only deals 3 damage this time.  The source of the effect is triggered on the space the target currently occupies.  (For larger targets, it can trigger on a space of her choice). (Prof 14) Iai Technique - When Kuro uses the ‘Delayed’ Echo effect on Double Crimson Slash, she can now assume a crouched stance with her sword sheathed, during which time she cannot take any actions, including activating other Echoes. When Double Crimson Slash would activate, she can instead teleport to the space it would activate from and make a regular Crimson Slash attack with advantage, its effectiveness increased by the Delayed effect as normal. She must have the delay last for at least 2 initiative turns if she does this. (Prof 22) Echo: Oblivion’s Trigram (3) - This Echo is a passive effect that charges by 1 each time Kuro uses a different Echo after attacking a target with Crimson Slash successfully. If she attacks a different target with Crimson Slash, the charges reset to 0 and no effect occurs. However, the next time she attacks the marked target with Crimson Slash or Double Crimson Slash, she can pay this Echo’s Stamina cost to follow up the slash with a series of rapid cuts that form the pattern of the Akadora family crest. The target is marked with stacks of Oblivion equal to the number of charges this Echo had when it was used.  Each stack of Oblivion on a target decreases all damage they deal by 1 (minimum half rounded down of the original damage value, minimum of 1 in all cases), and they take damage equal to the stacks at the end of each of their turns.  When they take damage from these stacks, the number of stacks on them are halved, rounded down. This Echo cannot be applied to the same target twice at the same time.  If it is Repeated, it could potentially hit a second target if Kuro also Shifts it or makes it Larger."
talent,Kuro,Midnight's Messenger,,0,Kuro gains 1 movement.
passive,Kuro,Boundary of The Self,,1,"Kuro possesses the Blade Of Boundaries, which allows her to collapse the space between two points; most often, her blade and the foe to be cut down. This also allows her to traverse great distances without any movement or effort on her part, becoming a shadowy blur of black and red.On her turn, Kuro can double move without spending her main action, can move, attack, and move again, and in addition, her unused movement acts as a secondary resource for her abilities. Her attacks and abilities have active components or ongoing effects called ‘Echoes’ that Kuro can utilize later. Kuro can spend the corresponding Stamina cost as a once-per round anytime action to trigger the Echoes of attacks or abilities she has used within the past round. Kuro can also apply additional effects to modify these Echoes, but each effect has an associated movement cost, and each one she applies to the Echo costs 1 Stamina to trigger regardless of its movement cost. These effects end immediately once they are triggered. She has the following options as additional effects to apply to Echoes: Larger (2 Movement) - Kuro dramatically increases the size of the effect, allowing it to hit a much larger area (roughly one dimension larger per use, e.g. a 3x3 becomes a 4x4) or become stronger and more durable. Further (X Movement) -  Extends the range of a given effect along a single axis; elongation rather than simple enlargement.  It extends roughly 2 spaces per point of movement spent. Faster (3 Movement) -  The effect becomes much more difficult to counter or avoid. Delayed (X Movement) - The effect’s activation is delayed by a number of turns equal to the movement Kuro spends on this effect. For each turn it is delayed, its effectiveness increases slightly, and the movement cost of all other effects Kuro uses is reduced by 1. When it does activate during a turn, it can activate at any point in the turn Kuro wishes. Repeated (5 Movement) - The effect occurs again, retaining all extra effects Kuro has spent on it so far. Shifted (3 Movement) - The effect in its entirety travels across the battlefield to a location of Kuro’s choice. Warped (3 Movement) -  The effect hits a different area than one would expect, as if its perspective was warped in a drawing program. The total area that it damages is unaffected."
ability,Kuro,It Tolls For Thee,4,0,"Kuro silently sheathes her blade while crouching near the ground.  For her chosen enemy, the sky seems to darken.  Kuro rushes forward in a 1xinfinite line towards a chosen enemy.  All mundane objects or obstacles in her path are torn asunder.  The target itself takes 5 damage and is knocked prone, and Kuro rolls 1d4. If she rolls a 4, this attack’s damage is quadrupled and this ability cannot be used again during this combat.  When Kuro uses this ability in combat and does not roll a 4, then if she uses it again during a future combat in this session, the die will be a 1d3 instead, and so on in this pattern until it is a 1d1.  The die resets if she rolls perfectly.  Note that if there are other living targets in her path between herself and her target, they will take damage equal to the amount rolled on the second die, unless she rolls perfectly, in which case they take double the die’s damage. Echo: Reaper’s Toll (1!) - Do you hear the ringing of the bells?  A crimson shade of a cloaked figure holding a scythe appears above a target of Kuro’s choice who she has used ‘It Tolls For Thee’ on during the past round is marked with a stacking debuff that starts at 0 and has a maximum of 5.  Each time the target moves or takes an action, the stack increases by 1.  The next time the target takes damage, it is increased by an amount equal to the debuff’s stacks.  Applying additional effects to this echo can cause the shade to switch targets or even spread the debuff across multiple targets, applying them to all within its range, which is a 1x1 square by default."
ability,Kuro,Metal Maelstrom,2,0,"Assuming a stance, Kuro lashes her sword in a circle around her, dealing 4 damage to adjacent targets of her choice. This then creates a 3x3 area centered on herself where the attack seems to continue in a continuous maelstrom, the slash itself continuing to tear through enemies.  She can immediately move out of this effect without spending movement.  Anyone who enters the area of the slash or starts their turn there takes 2 damage. This lasts for one round. Echo: Rose of Farewell (2!) - The whirling blade suddenly distorts and flares, a myriad of slashes bursting out from it in a dazzling pattern.  Anyone in the blade’s area when this is used is knocked aside, has -2 movement on their next turn, and takes 5 damage."
ability,Kuro,Sever The Shadow,3,0,"Kuro prefers to work alone, yet she understands that two blades are sometimes better than one. With a swift slash, she cuts her own shadow from her physical body, and it morphs into a silhouetted duplicate of herself that’s under her control. It has 5 Stamina by default, but Kuro may spend unused movement to increase it by 3 per space of movement spent. She can also funnel Stamina into it at a 1:1 ratio when it’s created. The shadow has all of Kuro’s usual capabilities except for her passive. It can act on her turn, but the shadow must roll as normal. However, the shadow does not have to make a roll if the shadow copies the same action she performs at equivalent effectiveness (though it cannot copy the extra damage of crits). This ability is a Bonus Action, but only one shadow can exist at a time. (Prof 20) Shadows Die Twice - The first time Kuro’s shadow summoned with Sever The Shadow would be destroyed in a combat, it is instead revived adjacent to Kuro with 25% (rounded down, minimum of 1) of its maximum Stamina. After this happens, Kuro is then able summon an additional shadow of herself to the battlefield as though the first one was destroyed; however, she and each of her shadows must pay 2 upkeep at the start of each of her turns in order to keep them both manifested. Any healing applied to the revived shadow is also heavily reduced. Echo: Speed of Darkness (0!) - This Echo is a passive effect that activates whenever Kuro uses another Echo. The shadow, if it’s possible for it to do so, uses the same Echo, without spending any Stamina or movement. Note that if Kuro and her shadow’s Echoes overlap to affect the same target, the damage of the shadow’s echo is somewhat reduced. In addition, Kuro can choose to apply any of her Echo effects to her shadow’s actions instead of her own."
ability,Kuro,Dragon Lance Rush,2!,1,"Black flames to burn the wicked. Kuro charges forward in a 1x6 space line, thrusting her blade as she does so, dealing 3 damage to all targets in the line. This can potentially block attacks, or even interrupt them on high rolls, depending on where Kuro ends up in the line. She can end the ability in a space before its maximum if she wishes. Once per Round. Echo: Shadow Rift (2!) - Abyssal energy seethes from the line Kuro drew across the battlefield with her earlier attack. It lashes outwards and attempts to restrain and deal minor damage to nearby targets. In addition, if Kuro uses another Echo while this one is active, she can choose one of the possible listed effects and apply it to this one for free."

talent,Tai,PCHOOOOO,1!,1,"Tai’s feet can fold out to reveal jets that let her FLY! Forever. (Prof 14) Rocket Power! - Tai’s jets can now be used as a once per round anytime, letting her use the propulsion or heat of the flames to dash around, singe things, etc. It also helps that her Hardlight Landmarks are compatible with rocket fuel!"
passive,Tai,Someplace I Wanna Be,,2,"At the start of combat, choose one: - Tai can designate a 3x3 area on the map. Whenever she or an ally stands in that spot, they experience calm, focus, and confidence, which quells their anxiety and makes their actions roll with a +3. Once designated, vein roots sprout through the ground in each cardinal direction in relation to the area. The area and veins stay present on the field even when Tai is unconscious, and the area itself counts as “vein roots”. (Prof 18) Home’s Where The Heart Is - On Tai’s turns, she can choose to move the area up to 2 spaces away from its current position. Hardlight Landmarks made either within the boundaries or on the vein roots will follow with it. - Tai can take stamina cost for any of her allies’ abilities. Vein roots sprout through the ground in each cardinal direction starting from Tai’s current position, and they move along with her. If Tai is knocked unconscious, the vein roots disappear. (Prof 18) The Heart’s Where I Am - Any and all Stamina Costs Tai takes are reduced by one, she gains one DR, and she can choose to orient the Vein Roots to go in any directions around her she pleases. She may only reconfigure their positions during her turn. (Prof 18) Someplace I REALLY Wanna Be - All variations of Someplace I Wanna Be have new function(s) that Tai gets to use (which are added above)! She ALSO gains a new version:  - But My Heart Belongs To Those I Trust - Tai can choose to assign up to 2 others as having her vein roots, with them spreading 4 spaces in the cardinal directions around them. These units have advantage on dual-teching with each other and Tai, and if their Vein Roots are touching each other or Tai, they have a +4 to support each other."
ability,Tai,Aortic Lifeline,2!,1,"At lightning fast speeds, Tai fires a wire from her arm into one of her vein roots, causing it to spring to life. Upon doing so, it can target an object or unit up to 2 spaces away from it, wrap itself around them, and throw them somewhere up to 7 spaces away from their current position. If something wrapped up in the vein root would take damage, Tai instead takes half of that damage (rounded up), and the wrapped up thing heals for the other half (rounded down). Once per round."
ability,Tai,For My Home,X,0,"Tai’s vein roots shimmer for a moment as they begin to draw in and/or expel energy. She can then take a property of any number of the objects/units standing on the vein roots and apply them onto either herself or another object/unit on the vein roots. Stamina cost is equal to the number of units/objects (excluding herself) involved in the ability usage, and potentially slightly more depending on the severity of what Tai is attempting to transfer."
ability,Tai,Hardlight Landmarks,3,1,"Tai taps into the spirit and life of those around her to create an Epithetical, 1x1 city structure in a space within three spaces of her current position. This structure acts as an immovable sentry that produces an effect/performs a particular action on adjacent units chosen by Tai during its construction. If a unit is standing on one of Tai’s vein roots, she can roll to have the effects of her structures activate on said unit (this can only occur once per turn). If one of these structures is directly on top of a vein root, its effectiveness is boosted. (Prof 16) Hardlight Projections - Tai’s Hardlight Landmarks provide a sense of wonder to herself and her allies. She can choose, when making a Landmark, to make it into a Sight or a Marker by paying an additional stamina. A Hardlight Sight makes a 2x2 landmark, but gives all adjacent allies a +2 to rolls on top of its usual effects due to being simply splendorous to be around. A Hardlight Marker is able to project its effects out 4 spaces away from it, but only to 1 person at a time as an anytime up to 3 times per round (usage is shared between Hardlight Markers)."

passive,Aperil,Hear No Evil,,0,"Aperil is deaf. Due to this, she is immune to all sound/sonic based effects. However, because of her Epithet, she produces a 2 space aura around her at all times, and all sound/sonic effects that make contact with the aura are negated. Whenever this happens, Aperil can choose to pay 1-2 stamina to take a negated effect and transfer it into herself. Then, as a once per round anytime action, she can attempt to apply the sound onto a chosen target/action to produce an effect based off of it onto them. Doing so plasters a word representing said sound on a physical object Aperil alters."
ability,Aperil,Do Ya’ll Hear Sumn?..,X!,0,"Aperil chooses action that is happening, and then makes it so it (or part of it) is sound based now. Stamina Cost is dependent on the severity of effect. Once per round."

ability,Aperil,Dididididididididididididi,1+X,0,"Aperil scream very loud. For moment, aura around her allows her sound to pass through, dealing 5 damage to all enemies inside. However, Aperil can take as many sound words from Passive as she wants and apply them to scream, with each costing 1 extra stamina. This does not count toward Passive’s once per round usage."

talent,BAMF,I’m [Sweeping] Da Bomb!,,1,"At the start of combat, B.A.M.F.’s player opens up Minesweeper. B.A.M.F. is canonically doing this in their head while passively not doing anything. If they can complete it successfully (a screenshot must be sent to the DM), all of their abilities gain an incredible (very small) boost and they and their allies recover 1, or maybe even 2 stamina! Wow! What a blast! (Prof 14) PROCESSOR OPTION: RISK OF RAIN 2 - B.A.M.F.’s processor now has the option of using Risk Of Rain 2 as the main processing program for B.A.M.F.’s functionality. Instead of playing minesweeper the player of B.A.M.F. can instead play risk of rain 2. Passively this increases their movement speed by 1 but takes an extra point of damage from all sources. For every stage that they complete in between B.A.M.F.'s turns is tracked with as X. B.A.M.F. then gains a passive roll buff depending on the difficulty the player is playing on as well as the number of rounds that have passed. The buff is equal to X/2 if the player is on drizzle, X if the player is on rainstorm, 2X if the player is playing on monsoon. Whenever the player dies in Risk of Rain 2 they roll a d20 in game, the next time they die they roll again and If the player rolls underneath the previous roll something bad happens. If the player of B.A.M.F. Beats the game (not obliteration) in between his turns something special happens."
passive,BAMF,For The Greater Good,,0,"B.A.M.F. can be picked up by allies and tossed up to 6 spaces in any direction. When they land, they explode, dealing damage equal to ⅔ of their maximum stamina (rounded up) to all units in a 5x5 area around them. If they are adjacent to an ally, B.A.M.F. can use their action to have the ally throw them. Once B.A.M.F. explodes, they are instantly knocked out. (Prof 12) You Exist I Guess - B.A.M.F, as a result of this upgrade, gets to exist!!! Wow!!! The things you get for existing include the ability to breathe in and out AND the ability to contemplate your existence using a whole round, but UH OH! Contemplating your existence might make you think harder than hard and make you explode in a 7x7 instead of a 5x5!!!"
passive,BAMF,MS OS,,0,"B.A.M.F.’s internal programming is run on Minesweeper. As such, when they start getting stressed by thinking too much, there is a good chance of explosive results."
ability,BAMF,Crack-a-Lacker Workshop Bomb,2,0,"B.A.M.F. pulls out a bomb they made themselves! It’s very good I promise. It can be thrown anywhere within 4 spaces of B.A.M.F., and if it collides with a unit or another bomb, it instantly explodes. This deals 1-3 damage to all adjacent units, and sends anyone hit by the explosion cartoonishly flying in a random direction for wildly varying amounts of distance. If a bomb does not immediately explode, it stays in the space it landed in until it makes contact with something!"
ability,BAMF,This Weighs More Than Me!,1,0,"B.A.M.F. picks up an adjacent unit or object, and throws them as hard as they can. The exact distance will depend on the quality of the roll.

passive,Evoa,Every Witch Needs a Familiar,,0,"A lot of mages can get familiars. Some get cats, some get owls, and others get more outlandish ones, like wolves or hedgehogs. Evoa’s is a cat! She named her Luci. Luci is a small black cat that Evoa can share her senses with and give small commands to (not that it listens 100% half the time anyway). It’s good at pickpocketing, scratching, being cute (which does need to be rolled for, but with a +20) and pretty much any other cat thing you could expect. Whenever Luci gets attacked, Evoa takes minor damage, but Luci somehow disappears and pops into Evoa’s clothes again."
ability,Evoa,Lost in a Book,4!,0,"Evoa holds out her book in a menacing fashion as an odd summoning-circle-esque construct appears, completely neutralizing the attack and - Oh NO IT’S IN HER SPELLBOOK NOW! Evoa adds another page to her spellbook based on the attack she just absorbed, often with a random/chaotic additional element to it. It can also copy effects that are affecting the battlefield, like a wild magic effect or the ground collapsing. Maybe weird shit, like something a player needs to do. Like rhyming. Once per Round."
ability,Evoa,Masks,3!,2,"Evoa reveals a mask of a teammate that she had, and puts it on, hiding behind something to conceal her as she comes out of the spot or hiding spot, looking like the ally that she had the mask of. This gives them their kit for as long as she wears the mask, with an upkeep of 2 per round.  Of note, she also has her kit but loses Luci as a summon. She can still transform her into objects if she’s taken Multifaceted. Evoa cannot get these kits permanently."
ability,Evoa,Multifaceted,2!,0,"All familiars usually have something based off of the mage’s epithet or set of spells, and Evoa’s is no exception! Using this ability, Evoa can transform Luci into pretty much anything, limited to nothing above about the size of the small kitten that Luci is. Anything from another animal, such as an owl or hedgehog (which has general effects and capabilities of said animal), or a hint more sparse, items. This being said, Luci does not like being an inanimate object for more than one round, if she’s used more than once in object form, she usually starts moving around as the object curves in odd ways, like a spell book page seeming to wave around or a gun barrel waving around like a tail. Luci doesn’t mind being a different animal. If used for an item that’s a one time use, the stamina cost is increased slightly, but Luci just pops back into Evoa’s cloak as always."

talent,Kasper,Dungeon Master,,0,"For SOME reason, Kasper has a supernaturally good sense of direction and “logic” when traversing dungeons or dungeon like areas."
passive,Kasper,Fuzzy Static,,1,"Kasper’s psionic capabilities are partially rooted in the concept of “Mental Repression”. With a flare of his energy, fog creeps in, warping reality and making the world more muted. Whenever Kasper makes physical contact with someone/something, he can roll to inflict the touched thing with a stack of “Repress”. Upon being inflicted with Repress, Kasper is able to choose a kit aspect of the afflicted that he is aware of and remove up to 5 words of said aspect from its text. The afflicted loses the memory of the kit aspect variably based on what was taken, which will usually change its effect(s) at least slightly. Kasper, receiving flashes of memory from the afflicted, is then able to store the words that were repressed, able to apply them to himself and his actions for variable effects! If an afflicted target has no valid kit pieces to take from, Kasper may instead take minor properties from the afflicted. Each time an afflicted target gains 5 stacks of “Repress”, the kit piece of theirs that is the most repressed becomes completely Forgotten, and Kasper gains it until the end of combat. If there is a tie for “most repressed”, roll randomly. This effect also occurs if a kit piece is fully repressed outside of the intervals of 5. On his turn, Kasper can use a Bonus Action to touch an adjacent target with the intention of inflicting Repress. This does not require a roll on willing targets."
ability,Kasper,Squall Blanket,,1,"Kasper gives a smart-alec-y grin before extending his hands out to his sides. They glow a bright yellow before a blanket of energy erupts from behind Kasper. In a moment, a volley of up to 5 yellow hands come flying out, each able to zoom to anywhere within 3 spaces of Kasper. They can do anything that hands are able to, but if being used for damage, they deal 1-2 each. Kasper himself can run up to a target a hand is next to and perform Klose Kombat if he desires. When Kasper first initiates Squall Blanket, summoning the titular blanket, any unit within a 3x4 in front of him is unable to perceive anything occurring outside of that area, except for the created hands and anything Kasper specifically allows them to."
ability,Kasper,Memory Block,2!,1,"Suddenly, Kasper causes a wall of force to manifest up to 3 spaces away from him, appearing as a connected wall of hexagons wavering at the edges, yellow TV Static acting as a pattern throughout. As this wall of force makes contact with something, it acts as a barrier and causes the affected unit(s) and effects originating from them to slightly phase out of reality, becoming semi-corporeal for a moment. Once per Round."
ability,Kasper,Dull The Noise,X,1,"Kasper reaches out to an adjacent target, yellow energy pouring out of his hand and swathing them. This energy seeps into the target and drowns out an effect and/or property of Kasper’s choice, essentially nullifying it. This can be as simple as overwriting someone’s wounds to heal them or removing a blade’s sharpness, or potentially something more abstract/complex. This effect lasts a variable amount of time depending on roll, cost, and what exactly is being affected. Similarly, cost is dependent on severity."
weapon,Merlin,Bandit Sword,,0,"Merlin’s trademark cutlass! Perfect for the greatest Phantom Thief Cat Burglar!

Every crit he lands automatically makes hit units prone, and whenever he makes someone prone (via crit or otherwise), Merlin gets to take one more action. He can use this action himself, or Baton Pass the action to another ally, allowing them to take their own, powered up action.

Regardless of tier, this makes enemies prone if they have an inherent wind weakness, are hit while afflicted with a status (aside from Overdosed), or if this rolls a 17 or higher. For each target Morgana successfully hits in an action chain, the DC for making someone prone decreases by 2. - Garu: 3 SP - Deals 4 wind damage to one enemy. - Magaru: 8 SP - Deals 4 wind damage to all enemies. - Garula: 6 SP - Deals 7 wind damage to one enemy. - Magarula: 14 SP - Deals 7 wind damage to all enemies. - Garudyne: 10 SP - Deals 10 wind damage to one enemy. - Magarudyne: 20 SP - Deals 10 wind damage to all enemies."
ability,Merlin,Dia/Patra My Balls,X,2,"Now that Merlin has faced the consequences of his actions, he now tries to instill healthier lifestyles onto his comrades. With this skill, he is able to tap into the spring of human happiness and heal/cure the status effects of a target(s) of his choice. He can specify the strength of the magic, each tier costing a different amount of SP.  - Dia: 3 SP - Heals one target for 3 stamina. - Media: 7 SP - Heals all allies for 3 stamina - Diarama: 6 SP - Heals one target for 6 stamina. - Mediarama: 12 SP - Heals all allies for 6 stamina. - Patra: 4 - Cures all negative status effects/debuffs for one ally. - Me Patra: 8 Cures all negative status effects/debuffs for all allies."
ability,Merlin,Lucky Punch,1,0,"Much like the financial sucker punch of being addicted to Black Tar Heroin, Merlin can deliver a potentially devastating strike using Zorro. This produces a cartoonish boxing glove that deals 1 damage to a unit within Morgana’s movement speed, and has an expanded crit range of 13-20."
weapon,Murdle,Shield Shell Toss,,0,"Sheldon grasps onto Murdle like a frisbee before tossing him at a chosen target. The attack has 3 range and deals 5 damage, and Murdle will then boomerang back towards Sheldon unless this attack rolls 8 or less (after roll boosts)."
weapon,Murdle,Snapping Turtle,,0,"When on the ground, Murdle prefers to deal with enemies by biting them. 3 damage 1 range."
talent,Murdle,Under the Sea,,0,"Seeing as how Murdle is a turtle, he is able to swim flawlessly, increasing his movement to 6 while within water."
passive,Murdle,Shell Servant,,0,"Upon leaving to participate in DBA, Silica created a demonic specter that acts as a butler with the task of assisting Murdle. This butler, affectionately referred to as Sheldon, carries Murdle around and essentially allows him to act as an average build human under most circumstances. Sheldon is unable to take damage, allowing Murdle to completely avoid any sort of grounded attack/obstacle so long as he is being held. If Murdle and Sheldon are ever separated, Sheldon is able to perform either a 5 damage basic attack or other simple actions on his turn(s) until the two are reunited."
ability,Murdle,Turtle Pinball,2!,1,"Murdle retracts into his shell, transforming him into the deadliest item this side of the riverbed. Any attacks that hit him while in this form have their damage significantly reduced, and any force that comes into contact with him launches him in the direction of said force. From here, Murdle essentially becomes a shell pinball, able to bounce off of walls and rebound into opponents to deal 4 damage per hit. Sheldon is able to launch Murdle with a non-damaging kick, which can be initiated upon activation of this ability if Murdle wishes. Once per round."
ability,Murdle,Cowabunga!,1,0,"Harnessing the spirit of certain turtle brethren, Murdle changes the color of his scales to produce a chosen effect. The same effect cannot be used two rounds in a row. - If Murdle turns blue, he gives advantage to a unit's next roll. - If Murdle turns red, he increases the damage of a unit's next attack. - If Murdle turns orange, he increases something’s/someone’s movement via skateboard. - If Murdle turns purple, the size and/or range of a chosen thing increases."
ability,Murdle,"Get Down, Mr. President!",1!,1,"As something comes towards Murdle, an ally, or another given object, Murdle proves why he’s a spatial anomaly by throwing a strange key towards it. If an object gets near the key, it is transported inside a small pocket dimension within a gem on the key’s base, and each time Murdle uses this he takes 1 stamina of cost. However, as a once per combat action, he can then release everything that he has stored at once to create a giant wave of objects and effects. Once per round for the key toss, while the once per combat is a main action."
ability,Murdle,Genbu Galactica,3⛯,0,"After a brief spark in Murdle’s eyes, his form begins to morph. He grows to a 5x5 size, and the top of his shell is decorated with a landscape/environment of his choice. Depending on the environment he chooses, his actions are modified to fit the new theme and anyone who chooses (or is forced) to ride on his back are affected in specific ways. Sheldon pilots him, and his “Snapping Turtle” basic attack instead deals 7 damage. If he so desires, Murdle can revert back to normal form on his turn as a free action. Once per combat."
weapon,Scoville,Blackstar Fighting Style,,0,"Scoville has his own particular fighting style in which he just strings together hand-to-hand combat with underhanded tactics and improvised weapons. Deals 5 damage at 1 range. On rolls of 17 or higher, this can apply debuffs if what he's doing could logically apply one. He can spend 2 points of Shell Density to apply a guaranteed poison status that deals 1d2 damage at the end of the target’s turn. (Prof 26) Greasy Boye - Blackstar Fighting Style’s poison status now deals 1d3 damage (increased from 1d2)."
weapon,Scoville,Arven,,1,"A massive electric guitar with a sleek, angular design that Scoville uses in his performances, he can rock out with it or tune it to give himself or an ally within 3 spaces a bonus to their rolls. If he wants, he can smash it on something adjacent to deal 10-15 damage and render it useless for the rest of the session."
talent,Scoville,Shiny Shell,,0,"While Scoville has at least 1 point of DR, anyone who attacks him gains a poison status that deals 1d2 damage at the start of their turns."
passive,Scoville,Chitin-Clad Charger,,2,"Scoville’s body has a chitinous exoskeleton that he can grow and recede at well (Urchin relations for the win am I right?!). He has a red stat that refers to the density of his exoskeleton, which gets shed or added to as he uses abilities. He has a max of 10, and for every 5 points in his red stat gains 1 DR against physical attacks. He gains 1 to his Shell Density every time he gets hit by an attack, as his body naturally adapts to the damage he’s taking. If someone specifically targets his shell with a powerful attack, then they can break parts of it off and reduce his red stat’s current number. (Prof 20) Blitzkrieg’s Backbone! - Scoville’s Shell Density now increases his DR towards a type of damage of his choice by 1 per 2 points within it and no longer reduces his movement. It also goes up for every separate instance of damage (so multihits now proc it multiple times). On top of this, he can now spend Shell Density on anything to either apply poison, increase the die size on poison, or add to rolls all at a 2:1 ratio. (Prof 26) Greasy Boye - When Scoville’s shell gets going, he starts to ooze poison from his spines. When at 5 Shell Density or higher, he can choose to leave his poison wherever he moves and even spread it through attacks innately! Anyone who starts or ends their turn on a poison square takes the effects of his basic attack poison. Additionally, each time he reaches an interval of 5 Shell Density, each of Scoville’s Main Actions gain a “Combo Charge”. When an action has a Combo Charge, he can expend it to combo into its correlating action from another action. Scoville cannot use the same action more than once in a turn with this Passive."
passive,Scoville,Intoxicating Rockstar,,1,"Any poison that Scoville applies can affect anything regardless of if it logically shouldn't be able to. Additionally, it can either be set to be sticky or caustic. If sticky, they reduce the target’s movement by the roll made for their effect alongside the usual debuff and being able to stick things together. If caustic, the effects of the poison worsen every time they tick, with the dice size increasing by one at the start of every one of the affected unit’s turns on top of being able to melt through things as tough as steel. Sticky poison takes a move or main action to try and purge while caustic poison can be purged on a usual free action roll at the start of someone’s turn, both with rolls of 10+ being able to cure it. Poison applied by Urchin’s Blast has a DC of 15+ instead. The DCs go down by 2 every time they fail."
ability,Scoville,Urchin Blast,2,0,"Scoville flourishes his hair, causing the two horn-like tips to launch globs of venom at a pair of targets within 4 spaces. This venom can either be very sticky or very caustic, but it usually does around 3-4 damage each and applies a poison debuff that reduces a target's rolls by 1d4 for their next turn. Infected targets can roll to remove it as a free action. Multiple stacks of the debuff increase how long the poison lasts, it does not increase the amount of d4s rolled."
ability,Scoville,Roll-Out Riot,3,0,"Scoville cracks his knuckles before curling up and using his shell to roll incredibly quickly in one direction. This roll goes up to 8 spaces away and increases his Shell Density by 3. If he runs into something, it’s almost guaranteed to be knocked prone and take 8 damage. He can, however, trade the damage for knockback. On rolls of 15+, the target is inflicted with a poison status that reduces their rolls by 1d2."
ability,Scoville,Venom Dynamite Starburst,5,1,"Scoville begins a performance that will absolutely rock the house, and by ‘the house’ I mean a 4x6 area in front of him. The targets in the area become trapped in a dense fog as Scoville’s band quickly sets up a stage and performs alongside him. If he has Arven unbroken, then he begins the show with a loud shred of the opening notes which makes it harder to interrupt (and plays his crit theme!) before going to town on the people in the area, bursting his shell completely as he smashes his guitar into the crowd, dealing 7-13 damage. Once he’s done, he leaves the stage behind and continues what he’s doing. At the end of Scoville’s next turn, however, the stage detonates in a fiery cloud of poisonous smoke. This causes all enemies within 2 spaces of the stage to be knocked back 4 spaces and take a poison debuff that reduces their rolls for the turn by a 1d4+1. This poison usually lasts more than one round unless there are special utilities used to be rid of it. This sets his Shell Density to zero and breaks his guitar if it is previously unbroken. (Prof 24) 24/7 Concert Setup - Scoville’s crew is really good at setting up stages in a relatively short amount of time! Venom Dynamite Starburst’s area increases to a 4x6 (from 2x3) with the attack’s damage increasing by 1 per Shell Density Scoville possesses. Additionally, when the stage detonates, it now doesn’t hurt or poison allies. The stage setup is so quick that even if Scoville rolls a Natural 1 on Venom Dynamite Starburst, it still shows up! But, the catch is that the Middle School Band hijacks it and plays their shitty brass solo, dealing 6 cringe damage to literally everyone in the combat even if they’re deaf because their music is so bad it (metaphorically) harms your soul."
ability,Scoville,Shield of Spines,1!,1,"Scoville can use this when an attack would be coming at him or an ally within 4 spaces to move however he likes to intercept the attack with his body! This reduces the damage by half at the very minimum and gives him a +2 Shell Density. If he ends up adjacent to someone, he can put his poison on them to either give them the debuff from Blackstar Fighting Style or allow their weapon to apply it on hit for their next 3 attacks. Once per Round."
weapon,Vanta,Edge of The Night,,0,A dagger that is completely black and seems to suck in any light around it. No shadows can be visibly seen (It’s Vanta Black colored). 5 damage 1 range. Vanta's dagger can be thrown at an enemy from a distance! On high rolls the dagger stays in the person. This is affected by her passive. She has multiple daggers. This deals 3 damage at 4 range.
weapon,Vanta,THE SOUUUUUUL REAVER,,0,Vanta carries around a gun with her. She only uses it when she is on the job or if a situation requires her to use it. The gun is of course blackened as well as the bullets inside. Deals 4 damage at 6 range. When she shoots an enemy she can use an anytime action to teleport to the bullet and follow up the attack with a slash with her dagger dealing 3 damage. The second part of the weapon can be used whether she misses or not.
talent,Vanta,Black is the New Black,,0,"Vanta is extremely into fashion. She likes to match with the rest of the party too. So instead of changing her clothes like a normal person, she has a bunch of stockpiled clothes for any size of individual so everyone can have matching black outfits. These outfits are affected by Vanta’s epithet, allowing her to use her abilities and passive on allies."
passive,Vanta,The Blackest Night,,1,"Using her epithet, Vanta is able to turn objects a pitch black. When an object has been “blackened”, she is able to manipulate it to a certain extent. She can’t change the original composition of the object but she can manipulate it as if she’s working with clay. She cannot blacken organic materials. There is no limit to the amount of items she can have blackened. As a twice per round, 0 cost anytime action, she can blacken an object within 20ft of her or 10ft of another blackened object. She is able to teleport to blackened objects providing she is touching a blackened object herself. The object she uses to teleport is left behind. To use teleportation, Vanta sacrifices half her movement. If the object is quite large, where on it she teleports is random. She is also able to see and hear through blackened objects that she is aware of the location of or one she has put extra care into. (ex: some of RTSL’s tools or weapons) All items unblacken at the end of combat unless Vanta has specifically put time into it. (Prof 20) The Black Plague - If a blackened item would touch another object that could potentially be blackened and is within Vanta's eyesight, Vanta is able to, as an unrolled effect, immediately blacken said item. There is a cost which is variable and determined by the GM, typically 2 at a baseline."
ability,Vanta,Can’t Even Trust Your Own Shadow,2,0,"Vanta throws one of her daggers at an enemy, missing on purpose. Once the dagger gets behind the target she teleports to it and stabs it into their back, dealing 6 damage. Once the dagger breaks through the target’s clothing she uses her epithet to meld the dagger and clothing together making it incredibly difficult to take the dagger out. She tells people that she’s teleporting to their shadow but she really isn't. This can be flavored to come from any direction."
ability,Vanta,The Darkest of Swaps,1!,1,"Vanta concentrates and manipulates her epithet to an impressive degree causing two blackened objects, and anything they are connected to in the same tile, to swap positions. Once per round."
ability,Vanta,Unleashing My Inner Demons,0,0,"Vanta channels her epithet into her own body to manipulate it. She then can take on the attributes of 3 of her blackened items that are within 5 spaces of her to manipulate her physique, giving her bonuses or new attacks she can utilize."
weapon,Zell,Blazing Chief,,0,"Zell’s pride and joy: a sword they constructed themselves using the remains of three other swords, scrap metal, and a high power engine. This resulted in a light brown, steampunk monster of a weapon that is only able to be wielded as efficiently as it is due to Zell’s vampire enhanced physical strength. Deals 6 damage at 3 range. Blazing Chief has cleaving properties inherently. (Prof 27) Burn Baby Burn - On rolls of 14+, Blazing Chief inflicts 2 Stacks of Burn (as per Zell’s Jack State)."
talent,Zell,Elemental Bending - Pyrokinesis,,0,"Typically, it is the eldest of vampires that gain the power to bend a particular element. However, despite their youth, Zell seems to be a natural when it comes to manipulating fire. They have the power to create and bend fire to a limited extent as a Bonus Action on their turn, and add it to other actions they perform for small bonus effects."
talent,Zell,Scrapyard Mechanic,,0,"Zell is pretty good with metalworking and engineering, at least when it comes to utilizing scrap and spare metal in a “steampunk” style. Not only do they have advantage on rolls to understand, utilize, or repair machinery, but they are also able to use their skills to modify metalworks to their liking. Given the right materials, they may be able to upgrade weapons and the like (permanently or otherwise), or create other small, simple devices."
passive,Zell,Exceed Engine,,2,"The defining feature of Blazing Chief is the massive engine protruding out of the blade near its crossguard. The grip can be twisted, revving this engine and further infusing Zell’s flames into it, powering up the blade and making its slashes all the more explosive. Zell can spend any portion of their Movement Action(s), converting the amount of spaces used into an equivalent amount of Rev Stacks, with every 5 Rev Stacks setting them into a different “Blade State”. They can also attempt to rev Blazing Chief whenever they successfully perform an action, with a normal success granting 1 Rev Stack, rolling within 1 of the number rolled for the initial action granting 3 Rev Stacks, and rolling the same number as the initial action or a Natural 20 grants 5 Rev Stacks. When not on a multiple of 5 Rev Stacks, they lose 1 stack every other turn. If knocked out, they lose 5 stacks every other turn. If Zell double moves, they cannot use the second movement to gain Rev Stacks. Zell’s Blade States, in order, are Jack State at 5 Stacks, Queen State at 10 Stacks, the choice of Jack or Queen State at 15 Stacks, and King State at 20 Stacks. Each State has Zell assume a different fighting style, granting them different passive boons, variations of their abilities, and a special “Inferno Ender”: an attack only accessible when in a particular state that, while powerful, reduces Zell’s Rev Stacks to 0. - When in Jack State, Zell begins funneling greater amounts of fire into Blazing Chief to really kickstart their flow. Wielding Blazing Chief with an inverse grip, a small torrent of flame flares up around them. They gain a 5ft aura that decreases enemy damage by 1 and increases ally damage by 1, and all of their damaging actions inflict a Burn Status on hit targets, dealing 1 damage to them at the start of their turn. Inferno Ender - Ring of Fire (4) - Zell stabs Blazing Chief into the ground with great force, causing a tornado of fire to whirl to life around them. It covers a 5x5 area with them at its center, where all allies inside gain a +2 to damage on their next attack, and all enemies take an initial 3-5 damage. Along with this, all units affected by this attack catch fire with an “Ethereal Flame”. These deal no damage, but allow Zell to manipulate the flames along with a burning unit’s body as a once per round Bonus Action on their turn, as well as a separate once per round Anytime Action. This cannot be used two rounds in a row. - When in Queen State, Zell uses bursts of flame to grant them increased mobility and acrobatic capabilities, utilizing Blazing Chief as a momentum shifting weight. They gain +3 movement (which cannot be used for Revving), can move-act-move, and attacks specifically targeting them roll with a -2. Inferno Ender - Wildfire Charge (5) - A pulse of energy is expelled from Zell as they charge towards an enemy within 5 spaces of them. Upon reaching them, they use momentum to the fullest to perform a massive swing of Blazing Chief, dealing 6-7 damage to the hit unit. After this occurs, they use the hit unit as a springboard, sending the unit up to 3 spaces in any direction, and themselves flying towards another unit within 5 spaces of them. If this unit is an enemy, Zell attacks them as they did the first unit. If this unit is an ally, they can springboard off of them towards another unit within 5 spaces, increasing the damage of the next slash they deal in this chain while doing so. They can continue this chain a maximum of four times, and they are guaranteed to at least be able to attempt up to two, even if they fail one of them. If a single unit is attacked multiple times in a chain, the damage of subsequent slashes is proliferated over time. - When in King State, both Zell’s body and Blazing Chief begin radiating a vibrant, fiery, orange glow as Zell wields Blazing Chief with both hands. They gain a +4 to non-ability damage, all of their attacks deal minor explosion/splash damage to nearby enemies, and their actions are armored, unable to be stopped by terrain or interrupts, only dodged. Inferno Ender - Ravager Nova (6) - Putting all of their power and rage into one, massive, overhead swing of Blazing Chief, Zell slams the sword into the ground. This cracks the earth, producing a monstrously powerful, 7x7 explosion of flame in front of them that deals 15-20 damage to all units inside as they are sent flying up to 6 spaces in any direction. The area the explosion occurred in remains a charred crater, acting as difficult terrain for all enemies and dealing 1d3+2 fire damage to all enemies who start their turn in the area. Any fire based effects are bolstered if they originate in, enter, or pass through this area, and Zell and their allies have a +1 to all damage while inside the area. Upon using this ability, Zell and Blazing Chief are worn out, constantly emanating a massive cloud of steam, making it so Zell takes +3 damage and cannot gain any Rev Stacks until the end of their next turn. Once per Combat. (Prof 25) Let's Get This Party Started - When combat begins, Zell glares at their opponents and immediately begins revving their monstrous blade in preparation for the coming fray. They start the combat with Rev stacks equal to their initiative divided by 5, rounded up. (5-9 = 1, 10-14 = 2, 15-19 = 3, 20 = 4). They cannot gain more than 4 Rev stacks with this upgrade under any circumstances. If they gain 4 Rev with this upgrade, their movement is doubled for their first turn."
ability,Zell,Blood Driver,3,0,"Assuming a low stance for an instant, Zell zooms forward up to 2 spaces, scraping Blazing Chief against the ground and producing flaming sparks as they perform a massive horizontal slash. This deals 4-7 damage to all enemies in a 3x4 area in front of their starting position, and they are afflicted with up to 3 spaces of knockback. For each unit hit by this attack, a blood construct bat is left in the space they were hit in. These bats have 4 movement, and can be absorbed by Zell or one of their allies to gain a choice of either +1 to rolls for the next 1d2 rounds or a property of the unit it was made from that can augment one action of the absorber’s choice. Jack State (3) - Zell first produces a wave of fire in front of them, before then slashing the wave with Blazing Chief, causing a volley of three fireballs to blast from it. These fireballs can travel up to 8 spaces away, dealing 3-4 damage to enemies they collide with, inflicting up to 5 spaces of knockback if desired. Enemies hit by this are afflicted with two Burn Status stacks instead of one (this is not increased if one unit is hit by more than one fireball), and gain their own instance of Zell’s Jack State aura. This aura can be stacked with Zell’s own. Queen State (3) - Zell performs a thrusting stinger with Blazing Chief, dashing in an up to 10 space line. This deals 4-7 damage to all enemies hit, and they are dragged to the space in front of Zell in the process, knocked prone. A trail of fire is left across the spaces Zell traveled across, which reach up 20 ft in the air. If an enemy passes through these flames, they take 1d3 + 1 damage, which passes through mundane DR. King State (5) - Blazing Chief erupts with tremendous force as Zell reels back. After a moment, they rocket forward, spinning rapidly with Blazing Chief extended outward. They travel in a 5-6 space line, dragging all enemies within 2 spaces of their position along with them in the process. This deals up to 6 damage to all enemies hit, with higher damage amounts being dealt the earlier a unit was dragged into the attack. After Zell has finished moving forward, they perform one final spin slash, dealing an additional 8-9 damage to all enemies within 3 spaces of them and sending them flying in directions of Zell’s choice, dealing explosive splash damage to adjacent enemies when they land. If an enemy was hit by the initial dash, they are unable to interrupt/negate the final slash, and Zell will always be able to hit them unless they roll a Natural 1."
ability,Zell,Burning Pledge,3,0,"Targeting a unit within the range of Burning Chief (which can be themselves), Zell performs an upward slash, producing a pillar of flaming wind that engulfs the target. If targeting an enemy, this deals Blazing Chief’s damage -1, passing through Physical DR and knocking the enemy skyward. Zell can follow them into the air if they desire and, if they do, they can pay another 2 stamina to perform a follow-up basic attack with half damage (before modifiers). Regardless of whether or not the follow-up occurs, the next attack the target is hit by has its damage increased by 1. If an adjacent enemy has successfully dealt at least 5 damage to Zell within the past round, they can give a separate roll to attempt to attack them along with the initial target. If targeting an ally, the flame pillar empowers their will. This grants them the choice of +3 movement, +1 damage, or minor lifesteal, and the ability to incorporate extra fire and speed based effects to their actions for the next round. If Zell has at least 5 Companionship with an adjacent ally that is not the initial target of this ability, they can give a separate roll to attempt to grant them these buffs to this unit along with the initial target. Jack State (3) - Zell causes a whirlwind of flame to kick up in the 3x3 area surrounding them, coating all adjacent units in the fire. Hit enemies take 1d2 damage initially, along with a minus to their next roll equal to the damage roll. Hit allies are healed for 1 and are able to Basic Attack any of the targeted enemies, regardless of whether or not they were damaged/affected by the original attack. Zell is then able to perform follow-up basic attacks of their own on each of the enemies that were successfully attacked by an ally. Queen State (3) - Zell dashes in a circle, specifically around 15ft of the space they started this action in. From there, they can choose to target enemies or allies. If targeting enemies, all enemies inside are caught up in a tornado of fire, dealing 3 damage as they are sent flying into the air. From there, Zell zooms up above them, performing a helmsplitter that sends them flying back down to the ground. This deals another 3-4 damage, inflicts up to 3 spaces of knockback in any direction, and knocks hit units prone. If targeting allies, uplifting, fiery winds overtake them, granting them all an additional Movement Action, granting them minor flight capabilities, and allowing them to flavor their actions as faster for the next round. King State (5) - With a massive upward swing, Zell produces a fiery explosion in a 3x3 area within Blazing Chief’s range. All enemies within this area take 7-9 damage as they are sent flying in the air, and from there, Zell can choose to pay another 1 stamina to perform a follow-up basic attack with slightly reduced damage (before modifiers) on one of the hit enemies. All allies within the area are filled with a burning passion, giving their next attack a 1.5x damage modifier, and they can incorporate extra fire effects into their actions for the next round."
ability,Zell,Dancing In The Dark,X!,1,"Zell’s eyes flash before they shift their form into a strange mixture of bat swarm and condensed, black mist in a humanoid form. They can move up to 3 spaces in any direction, able to phase through objects and/or units due to their misty form. At the same time, the bat portion of them can arrange themselves into any formation within this ability’s 3 space range, able to perform a quick attack alongside Zell’s mist form performing a slash with Blazing Chief. The damage/effects of these attacks are dependent on the exact formation taken along with the stamina cost spent, but if nothing else, a slash from Blazing Chief in this form typically deals 3-4 rather than its usual damage (before modifiers). Once per Round. Jack State (2!) - Zell produces a swarm of fiery bats that form a 3x3 wall in a chosen location within 4 spaces of Zell, able to protect them and allies from incoming attacks. After an attack hits the wall, the bats scatter in a storm of flame, moving over to and damaging the initiator(s) of the attack for 1d3 damage. By paying an additional stamina, the area the fire wall was first summoned in now grants the effects of Jack State’s Passive Aura. Queen State (1 + X!) - Zell’s body shifts to mist condensed to a humanoid form, which has sprouted large, fiery bat wings. Zell can immediately move anywhere within their movement speed, and while doing so, can grab onto one unit they pass adjacent to if they desire. This drags the unit along with Zell, and if this unit is an enemy, Zell can follow this up with a number of 1d2 damage slashes equal to the amount of stamina paid for this ability. Knockback up to the amount of stamina is also inflicted. King State (5!) - As an attack approaches Zell, they shift to a pure-black, misty form. The only thing more than a silhouette is their eyes, burning a fervent orange. They then parry whatever attack this was initiated in response to, slashing back with Blazing Chief as it sets completely ablaze. This deals damage equal to 1.5x what Zell would have taken from the original attack, causing the hit unit to be blasted away in the process. If Zell desires, they can choose for the initial counterattack to only deal 5-6 damage, instead producing 3 or more massive, fiery bats that can fly to a space within 5 of Zell’s current position. Zell can divy up the damage the counterattack would have done to each of the bats, and when they collide with an enemy, they explode and deal that much damage to them. These bats cannot initially be placed on top of the enemy that triggered this ability’s activation. Once per Combat."

When they are created, their stamina is whatever T.T.’s was at the time of activation divided by two rounded up. Each T.T. gets their own movement and action on T.T.’s turn. Once per combat. (Prof 7) I’m My Own Player Two - As a once per combat ability, T.T. can attempt an incredibly ridiculous dual tech with himself."
weapon,W,The Goop of Gods,,0,"Even though W’s a bucket, he’s still a god! Thus, he can fill the hole within himself with shadow realm goop which can be tossed upon opponents. 6 damage 3 range. Low rolls will cover less range and tip you over, and he can't get up without assistance. This does not apply if an ally assists him in throwing the goop by carrying you. Once covered, opponents will take damage and he can apply reality-warping effects on them."
talent,W,Get Me Outta Here,,0,"You really want a new body. Therefore, as long as you can get another person to agree to it, you can possess them instead!"
passive,W,"This World Is Mine, W",,2,"The longer W remains in combat, the more and more that the area becomes part of the Shadowrealm. As the Shadowrealm takes dominion, W becomes stronger, and if the Shadowrealm ever engulfs the whole field, he gains the full extent of his godly power. However, due to his... current state, this effect is slower."
ability,W,Chaotic Cacophany,5⛯,2,"Letting a small portion of his full power loose, W can unleash a wave of pure shadow and carnage in a 5x5 radius out from underneath himself. This not only dazes any hit unit, afflicting them with confusion, but also creates a shadow clone of them that work for W. These clones have 12 stamina each, and otherwise possess the same sheet as their base character. Once per combat."
ability,W,Buckets of Fun,4⛯,0,"Wow, W sure hates being a bucket. But what if there were more buckets? Once per combat, he can summon 5 other shadow buckets on random places on the map, and can teleport between them as a move action."
ability,W,Boop! Banished!,3,1,"W shoots out a ball of dark energy that, when it comes into contact with anything, expands into a small void leading directly to the Shadowrealm. Getting trapped in here not only deals variable damage, but allows W to inflict any effect of his choice onto the unit."
weapon,Zyonna,Deadly Technique,,0,"5 damage 1 range. Zyonna takes advantage of her impressive raw strength and agility to attack a chosen unit. This usually takes the form of a martial technique or Zyonna honing her hand into a claw to slash at someone. If this attack is successful and did not have Precision Stacks invoked, add 1d3 of Precision onto the hit unit."
weapon,Zyonna,Weighted Yo-Yo,,0,"It took pulling some strings to get this weapon made especially for you. It deals 6 damage at 3 range, and knocks hit targets up to 1 space in any direction or knocks them prone (assuming the target is 4x4 or smaller). However, this yo-yo spends Precision to increase its knockback, and cannot be used to increase its damage."
weapon,Zyonna,Razor Wires,,0,"Extremely thin wires which can easily slice through human skin. While this can be used as a basic attack to deal 1 damage and inflict 3 Bleed stacks at 1 range, that’s not its primary purpose. As a Bonus Action, Zyonna may leave some of the wire floating in the air where she is. Upon doing this at least twice, she may, as a Main Action, cause the wire to “snap” back, dealing 8 damage, inflicting 3 Bleed, and inflicting 1d4+1 Precision stacks on everyone within the shape defined while connecting the dots of wire left behind."
talent,Zyonna,Vital Scan,,0,"Zyonna is able to gauge the health of others with extreme accuracy. She/Her Player is able to know the exact stamina totals of enemies, or at the very least close to accurate estimations."
passive,Zyonna,Killing Blow,,1,"Every move you make matters, so make sure you finish your kill decisively. No uncertainty. Mess up, and there’s a good chance you’re dead. Zyonna has had this drilled into her head for as long as she can remember. As such, she goes for one-hit kills whenever possible. Various parts of Zyonna’s kit inflict stacks of “Precision” onto affected units. When performing an attack on a unit with Precision on them, Zyonna can choose to invoke the stacks to add damage equal to the number of stacks onto the attack. This must be stated before a roll is made, and if the attack fails, Zyonna will lose varying amounts of Precision. If the attack is successful, all stacks of Precision are removed, unless the attack knocks the unit out. In which case, they will ALWAYS have an absolute minimum of 3 Precision Stacks on them (which carries between Combats and Sessions) unless Zyonna forgets them and their capabilities. If Zyonna did not attack a given unit on her turn, one of her allies attacks that unit, and she can see this occur, she can roll to attempt to gain varying amounts of Precision on them. Zyonna can use a Full Turn Action to place 1d3+4 stacks of Precision on a unit. - 3 Precision on Eileen Wonderland - 3 Precision on Balthasar Reid (Prof 29) Defensive Patience - Whenever an attack would hit Zyonna, if the attacker has Precision Stacks, she may spend those stacks to decrease the roll of the attack by spending Precision Stacks. This requires no roll, but only works to protect herself as she dodges. So for example, if an AoE would hit her and an ally, this would only decrease the roll when it comes to hitting her, and the action would still resolve and hit her allies."
passive,Zyonna,Survival Instinct,,0,"While at half stamina and below, Zyonna goes into a defensive trance. She must now prioritize all defensive anytimes and actions to be solely towards protecting herself. However, in return she gains +3 movement and inflicts +1 Precision stacks on all actions that would inflict them."
ability,Zyonna,Shadow Step,X,0,"Taking in a deep breath and properly stancing herself, Zyonna begins walking at an exact speed. This ability is combined with Zyonna’s movement. For every step Zyonna takes, she pays 1 stamina, which produces an afterimage of her. If she passes an enemy while doing this, Zyonna can choose to basic attack them, utilizing any number of her afterimages to disorient the enemy and give her a variable bonus to her roll. Hitting with this basic attack grants an additional 2 stacks of Precision. If any afterimages remain after her movement is complete, they remain on the field until attacked or the end of her next turn. When attacking Zyonna or an afterimage, an enemy must roll 1dX (X = Zyonna + the number of Afterimages on the field), and on the highest result they hit the real Zyonna. Otherwise, an afterimage is targeted and fades away on contact. If this occurs, the enemy gains Precision Stacks roughly equal to the amount of damage they would have dealt to Zyonna (unless their attack would have dealt no damage, in which case they receive 1d2 stacks). They can then take a different main action, although at half effectiveness (this does not apply if an action other than a main action is used to dispel an afterimage). "
ability,Zyonna,Dislocation Point,2,1,"Zyonna dashes to a target within her movement at blinding speeds, essentially teleporting to them as she performs a particularly forceful jab. This typically deals around 3-6 damage to a hit unit, afflicts them with 1d2 Precision Stacks, and Zyonna can choose to instantly dash back to her starting position if she so chooses. The area she struck is now marked as a “Dislocation Point”, and Zyonna can, as a Once per Round per Point anytime action, cause whatever was struck to wildly dislocate. This may damage an affected unit, add 1d3 Precision Stacks, and/or cause an action they are performing to be interrupted providing the dislocation would cause that. If one of Zyonna’s allies strikes a Dislocation Point on an enemy, the enemy gains 1d2 extra Precision Stacks, and if Zyonna strikes a Dislocation Point, she deals +1d3 damage and gains 1d4+1 stack of Precision on them. This ability can be used on objects and structures to cause them to break on command. If Zyonna uses this ability on herself, she takes no damage, and this can be used as a Bonus Action."
ability,Zyonna,Sixth Sense,3!,1,"This ability has two variations dependent on whether or not it was used in response to an incoming attack. If used in response to an incoming attack, time seems to slow for Zyonna as she perceives her surroundings in a 3x3 around her in an instant. This allows her to perform an action in retaliation. This action grants extra Precision if it is successful. If Zyonna only uses a movement action, this ability only costs 1 stamina and gives her 1 Precision on the unit who initiated the attack this ability was used in response to. If used without an attack prompting it, Zyonna begins to hyper-analyze a target she can see. At this point, Zyonna begins thinking through a potential interaction between her and this unit. This takes the form of a “Hypothetical Battle”, where Zyonna and the unit each take one turn fighting each other and exclusively each other. The other unit can only use actions that Zyonna has seen them use before, and as this fight is only imaginary, therefore it does not actually affect the units involved. While in this combat, Zyonna tries her hardest to dissect the other units’ movements and learn how they work. If she proves successful in this endeavor, she will gain roll buffs against that unit and/or Precision Stacks on that unit proportional to how well she “learned” to fight against them. Once per Round. (Prof 32) Subconscious Dexterity - Sixth Sense’s reactionary variation can now be used against attacks that she isn’t aware of or that she can’t normally react to either because of speed or mental fuckery, as her combat instincts are honed to the extreme. Its standalone variation is a guaranteed success against enemies who she’s gained minimum Precision Stacks on with Killing Blow."
ability,Zyonna,Counter Strategy,X,0,"You were always taught to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. Using this ability, you may spend X stamina and double X in Precision Stacks to devise a technique especially designed to counter their gameplan. Note that this only allows you to utilize things you’re already capable of: it does not grant you new powers, but rather hones your existing ones in a way that works against your target. Can be used to make abilities or passives. Abilities created with this cost no stamina and passives require a 1 stamina upkeep. The power of the technique is relative to the roll and how much stamina/Precision Stacks were spent. Bonus Action."
weapon,Lavin,Flow Gear,,0,"When all else fails, Lavin always has his martial arts prowess to fall back on. Despite his large stature, he is surprisingly nimble, producing swathes of ink-like-energy as trails following his body during his attacks. This basic attack passes through most forms of DR, and, if he holds his action to use this basic attack, he is able to use it to deflect/reflect most attacks that come his way. 8 damage 1 range."
weapon,Lavin,Pure Sight,,0,"Lavin extends his palm, producing an eye on it that begins charging a laser beam once it makes eye contact with a target. Once this target breaks eye contact with the eye, it fires the projectile, dealing variable damage depending on how long they were looking at it. The longer they were looking at it, the more damage it deals to them. If Lavin is adjacent to someone when they break eye contact, he is able to capitalize on the opportunity to perform another main action, regardless of what turn it is. Bonus Action. Optic Orb - If he desires, and if Lavin does not use his movement action to move on his turn, he can manifest an orb of pink-purple energy from the eye he produces on his hand. This orb, 2x2 in size, is then thrown at a target that Lavin can see, not affected by gravity in the slightest. This deals around 5-6 damage at base, but Lavin can funnel his stamina into it to have it deal more. If the target closes their eyes, the ball disappears, reappearing when their eyes are reopened, its trajectory redirected towards them."
talent,Lavin,Pledge Statement,,1,"Whenever Lavin takes an action, he can choose to place a restriction of any kind upon himself, making the action more difficult to perform or set-up easily. In return the effectiveness of the action, in some way, is greatly boosted."
passive,Lavin,Baroque Works,,1,"As a movement action (that, when used, counts as an action for the purposes of things that proc on actions being used), Lavin can manifest a canvas pad along with his ink brushes and begin working on a new piece of art. This work uses something Lavin can currently see as the subject matter, and Lavin’s roll dictates the quality of the work. Utilizing this Passive requires Lavin to have traditional inks and paints on his person, which become empowered by his Epithet. Once he has completed a work, he can, as an anytime action, invoke the work as a “Baroque Flair”. Doing so causes his body to be enveloped in a pinkish-rainbow light pattern, as he either causes an effect based on the work’s subject to occur or modifies an action he or a unit within 4 spaces of him is performing in relation to said subject. Each time a Baroque Flair is invoked, some of the ink/paint of the utilized work fades away, as do minor amounts of the correlating ink/paint on Lavin’s person. This means that Baroque Flairs have limited uses until Lavin would have to redo a work, which is dictated by how much ink/paint the work has. The more a work has, the more times it can be used, but of course, works of greater complexity may take Lavin longer to paint fully. If Lavin has another painting he has created on his person, he can use this for the purposes of invoking Baroque Flairs."
ability,Lavin,Special Agent Bomber,X,2,"With a snap, Lavin produces a suited figure oozing with Epithetical energy. These “Special Agents” are INCREDIBLY explosive, able to be detonated with horrifying force. Lavin is able to create as many of these Special Agents as he wants at a time, with each one adding 1 to this ability’s cost. However, if these Special Agents are created on a whim, their capabilities are only minorly effective. At any point, Lavin can choose to store the creation of Special Agent Bombers within himself as a bonus action. The longer they stay stored, the more powerful they are when released as a main action. For example, Special Agent Bombers created moments before release are decent. However, if Special Agent Bombers are created days or even weeks before release, their destructive potential skyrockets. As Lavin keeps more and more Special Agents stored inside of himself, his body becomes more and more stressed, potentially causing his failures to misfire into explosions able to damage himself. Special Agents must be kept within 100 ft of Lavin, otherwise their power/capabilities are greatly reduced. Special Agents pass through any DR that is not explicitly and exclusively for explosive damage. If only one Special Agent Bomber is summoned in an instance, this ability can be used as a Bonus Action. Special Agent Bombers must initially be summoned within 50 ft of Lavin. On-Call Kamikaze (X!) - With a whistle, Lavin calls in a Special Agent Bomber flying a fighter jet. They can be called anywhere in the battlefield, and they immediately crash into a unit of Lavin’s choice, exploding violently. The power of this move follows the same conditions of the base Special Agent Bomber ability, but is generally weaker overall. Lavin can use any Special Agents stored within himself for this ability. Detonation Delay (1!) - Whenever a Special Agent would explode, Lavin can use this ability to have them delay the explosion for as long as he desires. The longer the delay, the more the explosion’s power is increased. Lavin can choose any point during any turn to have them explode."
ability,Lavin,Color Burst,3,0,"Lavin’s body shines brightly with a distinct, pinkish rainbow light pattern as he dashes forward at incredible speeds. He can move up to his movement speed +2 in any direction (he is able to fly if he so desires), choose to phase through units and objects while doing so, and can perform martial techniques on those he passes. These attacks typically deal damage equal to that of his basic attack or more. Along with these, he is also able to perform energy blasts while in this state, typically reaching up to 3 spaces away from him, dealing 5-6 damage, and inflicting high knockback. In order to use this ability, Lavin MUST invoke a Baroque Flair, and this ability typically expends more of a work’s ink/paint than a standard invoking would. In return, the Baroque Flair can modify this ability just as it would another action. Once per Combat, Color Burst can be used as an anytime action."
ability,Lavin,Negative Field,3,2,"Lavin takes a deep breath, calming himself as he pushes negative energy out of himself. Doing so produces a 7x7/15ft aura around Lavin, where everyone inside but him is subjected to a torrent of bizarre energy. Specifically, movement becomes sluggish (as if they were moving through sludge), thus reducing it and/or giving units roll penalties, units have the chance to be inflicted with random, negative status effects, and shadows of units and objects have the capability of multiplying and manifesting as summons that Lavin can control on his turn. Maintaining this area has an upkeep cost of 3 + X, with X being equal to the amount of rounds the aura has been on the field. By paying an additional 2 stamina activating this can be done as a Bonus Action. Dark Recesses (X!) - Lavin snaps, choosing a unit in the Negative Field (which can be himself) and causing their shadow to spring to life and perform an action within 5 spaces of the castor. Once this occurs, the shadow of the caster disappears until they leave the Negative Field. Once per Round."
ability,Lavin,Metalworks Cast,X,0,"Lavin conjures a ball of liquid metal before morphing it into any shape of his desire. With this ability, he can produce replicas of any structures or weapons he has ever seen in person, along with more generic forms if he so desires. These metalworks must ALWAYS be touching a living organism or Epithet Construct/Summon, or else they begin to rapidly deteriorate and rust. Stamina Cost is dependent on severity of the desired effect. Smithy Works (X) - Lavin produces a hammer, and uses it to begin morphing/terraforming adjacent units/objects/surfaces. This can produce variable effects depending on what Lavin is using this on, and how he chooses to modify things. If being used on a summon, this can be used as a Bonus Action, but if used on another living unit, it typically requires Lavin to pay more stamina than he would otherwise to use this."
ability,Lavin,Afterimage Trick,2!,2,"Lavin crosses his arms, and after a brief moment, it is revealed that the Lavin that was present on the battlefield was just an afterimage. Lavin can produce any number of afterimage clones while doing this, and can use it to either dodge something or fake doing something. Twice per Round. Quick Shot (1!) - Can only be used after successfully using Afterimage Trick. Lavin shifts his momentum dramatically, allowing him to move up to 4 spaces in any direction while performing a martial technique of his choice."
weapon,Velletri,Reaper's Dance,,0,"Utilizing her twin scythes, Velletri elegantly slashes through a chosen target, dealing damage to their very soul. 8 damage 2 range."
weapon,Velletri,Eclipse Waltz,,0,"With a graceful windup, Velletri tosses one of her scythes with a great deal of spin on it. Pierces through targets before warping back to Velletri's hand automatically. 5 damage 5 range. Alternatively: With a snap, a skull shaped explosion erupts underneath a unit of Velletri's choice. This has a high chance to knock the target prone, and inflicts them with a Cursed Status that deals 1 damage at the start each turn until they can stave the status off with a check. The effect of this can stack. Bonus Action."
talent,Velletri,Death At Every Corner,,0,"Velletri is able to fly naturally, and can teleport to any space she has stepped on as a movement action."
passive,Velletri,Guide of The Underworld,,2,"On one of Velletri's turns, she can create a shroud of epithet based shadow with eyes present on every inch of it. She places this shroud over her head, and cannot move for the rest of the round. However, once the top of the round once again comes, it is revealed that the entire past round was merely her vision of the future, and she then gets three turns to try and change fate. This can only be activated Once per Combat."
passive,Velletri,Back And Call,,1,"Due to her Epithet, and how she has decided to hone it, the being known as Ose is bound to Velletri's soul. She can use her Movement Action to teleport Ose adjacent to her, and can have Ose take stamina costs for her. Ose’s turn can either be separate on Turn Order, or combined with Velletri’s."
ability,Velletri,Spiritual Assistance,1,0,"Producing a ghostly hand constructed of cold flames, Velletri envelops up to two targets of her choice, and drags them to a specific place in the arena. Anyone in the path of one of these dragged units takes 3 damage as they pass by, as does the grabbed unit at the same time."
ability,Velletri,Death Cometh,1,0,"Velletri produces a spectral skull on a space of her choice within 4 spaces of her. This can be done as a once per turn free action. Then, as a standard action, she can activate this ability to immediately dash between every skull on the field, dealing 7 damage to enemies she passes through."
ability,Velletri,Fate Ends Here,1,0,"Velletri extends her hand upward, igniting every space she has stepped on in during this combat in cursed flame. This deals 8-10 damage to anyone standing on the space, and inflicts them with the Cursed Status. Using this ability removes traces of her having stepped on those spaces."
ability,Velletri,Wither Away,2,0,"With a snap, a spectral scythe appears behind a unit of Velletri's choice. The scythe follows them, dealing 1 extra damage to them every time they take damage and increases all stamina costs by 1. This effect lasts until the unit can make a high enough check to stave it off."
ability,Velletri,Reaper's Right Hand Men,2,1,"Velletri creates a skeletal servant that stays on a space within 4 spaces of her current position. If any enemies walk through its adjacent area (including moving out of the area), it can make an attempt to attack them for 5 damage. These servants cannot be damaged, and if any effect attempts to dispel them, Velletri may try to counter roll."
ability,Velletri,Land of The Dead,3,0,"Velletri produces a 7x7 area centered on herself emulating the harshest conditions of The Underworld. Upon activation of this ability, all enemies take 4 damage. Every time an enemy starts their turn in the area, they take 1 + X (X = the amount of consecutive turns one has remained inside) damage and have -X movement. Only one of these areas can be on the field at a time."
ability,Velletri,Fatal Path,10,2,"Velletri selects a 2xInfinite line in the arena, and after an epithet surge, a skeletal reaper appears at the end of the line. At the start of Velletri's turn next round, the reaper flies down the line, swinging its scythe rapidly. Any enemy hit by this attack is reduced to within 5 stamina from death."
weapon,Ose,Ravaging Wrath,,0,"Ose tears into an enemy within 2 spaces of him, typically breaking their bodies in the process. If attacking a prone enemy, this deals +2 damage minimum."
talent,Ose,Eternal Slumber,,1,Ose can sacrifice a turn to heal himself by a fair margin.
passive,Ose,Death Never Dies,,2,"Given strength through Velletri's Epithet, Ose is a revenant bound to her, and is unable to be kept down so long as she is still standing. If Ose is reduced to 0 or lower stamina, he will regain 3 stamina at the start of each of his turns until he gets back up."
ability,Ose,Bull Rush,3,0,"Ose bucks, and then charges forward. He continues moving until he hits a wall, and he drags the first person he hits with him. Anyone else that collides with him after the first takes 6 damage and are knocked to the side, whereas the one Ose charged into takes variable damage depending on how long the charge went on for."
ability,Ose,Skeletal Assault,1!,1,"With a roar, Ose extends an arm towards a target of his choice, so long as they are within 6 spaces of him. His arm then morphs into a completely skeletal form, dealing 4 cold damage to those it collides with. For every time this has been used on a given target, that target takes an extra +2 damage. Once per Round."
ability,Ose,Scream of The Damned,2,2,"Ose lets out a horrifying scream, dealing 5 unblockable, irreducible damage to any enemies within a 5x5 radius of him. This also pushes hit units back 3-4 spaces backwards."
weapon,Ms Tiger,Tooth and Nail,,0,"Morphing one of her body parts completely into its tiger counterpart, Ms. Tiger lets her instincts run wild. 8 damage 1 range."
weapon,Ms Tiger,Tail Strike,,0,"Ms. Tiger's tail heats up immensely as it zooms into a unit, dealing 3 fire damage at 2 range as a Bonus Action."
talent,Ms Tiger,Feline Grace,,0,"When Ms. Tiger is free falling, she almost always lands on her feet, and takes little to no fall damage. This also means it is exceptionally hard to knock her prone."
talent,Ms Tiger,Cheetah's Dash,,0,Ms. Tiger gains +2 movement.
passive,Ms Tiger,The Hunter Don't Stop,,1,"When a hunter's on a roll, like hell they're gonna let it end! Whenever Ms. Tiger deals damage, half of that damage (rounded down) is added onto her next attack's damage. If an attack fails, the modifier is used up."
passive,Ms Tiger,Predator Advantage,,0,"The tiger has pounced and made her mark, and now that you're down, you're out. Whenever Ms. Tiger knocks someone prone, she gains +1 damage for the rest of combat."
ability,Ms Tiger,Eye of The Tiger,2!,1,"As something goes to strike Ms. Tiger, her instincts flare up as she begins to perceive things in slow motion. Her eyes dilate as a patch of Epithetical grass pops up next to her. She zooms into it, before teleporting to the source of the attack, honing in on an open spot in their defense. She then performs a basic attack on them, but with up to 6 knockback. If used in a situation other than in reaction to an attack, this attack is not affected by Ms. Tiger's The Hunt Doesn't Stop Passive in any way. Once per Round."
ability,Ms Tiger,Bengal Blitz,3,2,"The rainbow aura usually surrounding Ms. Tiger turns to a stark white as she bursts forward at incredible speeds. She can move in a straight line up to her movement +2, dealing 10-12 fire damage to hit units, and afflicting them with a d4 burn status. Ms. Tiger can convert any damage from this attack into either knockback or into the dice size the burn rolls with (although, for the latter, it's a 2-1 ratio)."
ability,Ms Tiger,Tiger Shot,X,1,"Ms. Tiger's eyes flash rainbow colors as she calls up to 3 spectral tigers out from a location of her choice. They burst out with a fair bit of momentum, and explode into Epithet energy upon damaging a target. Damage and Stamina Cost is dependent on the severity of the desired effect. If the tiger(s) deal no damage to anyone, this ability can be used as a Swift Action."
ability,Ms Tiger,Mouth to Feed,1!,1,"With a snap, Ms. Tiger creates a pair of feline teeth that float in a space within 4 of her current location. If an enemy passes next to the mouth, it bites down on them, dealing 4 damage and holding them in place. If a unit starts their turn stuck in the jaws, they take 1 damage. Once per Round."
ability,Ms Tiger,Cat Scratch Fever,3,0,"Ms. Tiger's claws extend while glowing, producing a sharp sound that rings through the arena. She then scratches a 3 space wide sweeping area, dealing 9-11 to damage to everyone inside. The area that was scratched remains scratched for 1d2 rounds, and it counts as difficult terrain that deals 2 damage to enemies that move onto or off of a space of it."
ability,Ms Tiger,Tiger Destruction,5⛯,2,"Her eyes gleaming, Ms. Tiger performs a knee strike onto an opponent to launch them into the air. The air around her begins to heat up, as she then lunges up with a powerful uppercut, producing a massive spectral tiger that encases her while doing so. This deals 20 damage initially, afflicts a d4 burn status, and makes it so the hit unit takes +1 damage from Ms. Tiger for the rest of combat. When the unit crashes back down to the ground, they produce a 5x5 explosion that deals 7-10 to all enemies inside. Once per Combat."
weapon,Wolf,Brass Knuckle Brawl,,0,"Wolf lets loose a wild flurry of blows with his brass knuckles, showing rather ruthless proficiency in martial arts. 7 damage 1 range."
talent,Wolf,Moody,,0,"Wolf is rather unapologetically angsty, and pretty much nothing shakes him off of that. As such, while he is exceptionally vulnerable to being angered, he is immune to all other emotional effects."
talent,Wolf,Arch Enemy,,1,"Wolf's being adjusts itself to be diametrically opposed to those he has made enemies with. Thus, as he fights someone more and more, he can create modified versions of kit aspects to oppose and counter them."
ability,Wolf,Fated Clash,1!,1,"After taunting an enemy, Wolf dashes in to meet an attack of theirs. This causes him to take the attack full force, amplifying its effect(s) slightly, but then allowing him to perform an especially empowered action against the target. This counterattack is especially difficult to block, dodge, interrupt, etc. Twice per Round."
ability,Wolf,You're Mistaken,1!,2,"In an instant, Wolf dissolves into red energy and teleports behind a target of his choice, having hit them with his basic attack in the process. Each time he does this on a specific target, they gain a stack of Vengeance, which causes them to take +1 damage from Wolf's attacks. If used in tandem with Fated Clash, Wolf can still perform the action that FC grants. Once per Round."
ability,Wolf,Long Way To The Top,3,1,"With a nasty scowl on his face, Wolf jumps back into the air, staring down at a 3x3 area of his choosing. In a flash, a massive red arm punches down onto that area, dealing 10-12 damage and knocking all hit units prone. This fist continues punching that area on Wolf's turn for the next 2 rounds."
ability,Wolf,Relentless Rush,3,1,"Wolf rushes at a target before delivering an absolute beat down upon them. At the same time a series of red arms appear from behind Wolf, punching alongside him. This deals 8-9 damage initially, and Wolf can pay an additional 2 stamina to begin walking forward for half of his movement. If he does this, units take 6-7 damage each time they are hit."
ability,Wolf,Remember Me?,X,0,"Using his Epithet, Wolf reaches into someone’s being and finds something that they either despise or that they are constantly forced to face against. He takes this thing, and applies a buff onto himself or an adjacent target related to said thing."
weapon,Donovan,ATLAS,,0,"Donovan’s sword. As unbreakable as he is. 1 range and 6 damage. Really, literally cannot be broken. Like. Ever."
weapon,Donovan,ACHILLES,,0,"Whaddya mean it's not a sword, look it's got an edge, that means it's a sword. Whaddya mean I just sharpened a metal bat. Every hit against a target reduces their endurance, causing them to take 1 extra damage from physical attacks for the rest of the combat; if the target has any kind of DR, that starts going first, regardless of type. 1 Range 4 damage."
weapon,Donovan,HADES,,0,"The cursed sword, HADES. Donovan found this sword behind a strange wall with weird markings on it while he was punching rocks. The cursed sword HADES can not be removed from his person, ever. It deals 8 damage at 1 range. Every combat he doesn’t use it at least once increases its damage by 4 and crit range by 2 but this also lowers his knockout range by 25% rounded up. It also only receives half of his usual damage bonuses rounded down."
weapon,Donovan,Hand-To-Hand Deathbat,,0,Donovan is an experienced martial artist and is able to hit things really hard from a surprising distance. 2 range and 4 damage. He cannot be harmed by the backlash of attacking something hard or fire and the like. He gains proficiency if getting a nat20 with this weapon.
talent,Donovan,I'm The Monster Now,,2,"While at 1 stamina Donovan must take more than 10 damage in a round to be knocked out and he is extremely resistant to status effects that deal damage. He can only gain a maximum of 2 max stamina from combat rewards, achievements and the like. 19. Death Percent? What The Hell’s That Mean? - For every 7 max stamina Donovon has, his knockout requirement goes up by 1. 58. My Epithet... is ENDURE! - Donovon becomes immune to standard status effects that deal damage. Tajvahl Wish - Donovan can now gain a maximum of 4 stamina from rewards."
